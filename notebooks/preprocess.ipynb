If it was above a threshold, then I considered it the start of a new semantic section. I originally tried taking embeddings of every sentence, but this turned out to be too noisy. So I ended up taking groups of 3 sentences (a window), then got an embedding, then dropped the first sentence, and added the next one. This worked out a bit better."

It's the compou think of compound as being the one that's more difficult to think about. Six eight times, nine eight times.\",\n",
       " \"Yeah. Right. Still leaves three two three or four beats in a bar, but they're compound times. They're dotted beats. That's really all that compound means. It means dotted beats. Erm  what would twelve  twelve four? Think about twelve four cos that's a compound time. It's got twelve at the top. Erm it may help to look at it. Cos you can't think about it straight away. Think  twelve, and it'll be twelve what? Dotted semi-quavers. No. What does four stand for in an ordinary time signature? Oh crotchets. Right so \\nSo. if there are twelve of those. Twelve crotchets. One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve. Think of them in groups of threes  and that gives you four  dotted? Quavers. No. Semi-quavers. You're, you're going small\\nYes. and you've got to go the other way. Oh yeah. It's erm\\nIf there are tw if there are twelve crotchets and each of those are in groups of three. Dotted minims. So you've got four dotted minims. So twelve, I mean if you can remember them twelve stands for four beats in a bar anyway\\nYeah. and  if you just think what twelve crotchets are going to be divided up into\\nMm. it's going to dotted minims. Cos you know it's going to be dotted something or other. And if you were to see  er an extract of music  for example here's a twelve eight one. This one actually tells you it's in twelve eight time. And it's asking you to put in the bar lines. Where would you  put those bar lines do you think? It would al I think it probably also asks you to  to group them properly. But just for the moment we won't worry about the grouping aspect. I think, assume everything starts on the first beat of the bar as well. Okay. It'll tell you if it doesn't. Erm\\nEight stands for ? Quavers. Right  \\nOne two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve . So obviously the first one would be there. And probably if it's going to be a whole one \\nOne two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve. So in fact there are just two bars. Now how would you actually group  those notes? Erm  it'd be groups of three again wouldn't it? In groups of three. Those two've got to be grouped together. One two three four \\nEr  it'd be sort of half of that. Half of the erm crotchet. I don't know how you do that. Can we go backwards. One two three four five \\nYou can only do it if you miss out that. One two three. One two three. And that leaves you with a  a little bit  \\nRight. Yes. It actually explains it. Exactly what they want you to do. Er where you've got a note that obviously goes over a beat  as in that one there\\nYeah. you're, you're going to have to write two quavers and tie them.\",\n",
       " \"Is that what you said? Yeah. It might have been what you said . So those two  okay. That one will be joined to a quaver beat, so that you'll have a group of three. And another quaver, those two will be tied  the join taking them onto the next group of three and so on. So basically you're splitting this in compound time? Yes. So it it'd still sound\\nCos that, that actually looks as though it's the half way part of the bar too doesn't it? So, and you, you don't actually go over the half \\nYeah. way part of the bar with one single note. If you've got a note it's got to be held. You actually split into two an and use a tie. If you're in two time or four time which you are. You're in four  four dotted  crotchets beats there aren't they? You will sometimes be asked to  er look at something like that and then put the time signature in. These have got the time signature in but you're, they're asking you to put in the bar lines and then grouping the notes properly. As in that one, you've go you've got to alter what they actually put there. Not going to alter the sound of it. The sound must still be the same but you've got to alter the notes for grouping purposes. That may happen in any of those. I wonder if they've got any here now that haven't got  any time signatures, because that's the other thing that they  they like to give you. Down here. Add time signatures. Alright. Let's see what you can make of first of all that one. And whether they're all compound, they may not all be compound. Some may be, some may not. I don't know. Find the simplest bar  in each one. this one. Looking through it that is the simplest one cos you can see \\nYes. at a glance there are two \\nIt's all, it's all \\ngroups of three aren't there? Yeah. So that's obviously going to be in compound time. What though? Erm\\nFairly easy to put in a time signature. Six twelve. Six er  now wait a minute. What's  four is for crotchets. Eight is for quavers. Double it again, sixteen. Six sixteen. It's gonna be sixteen. So six sixteen. And that actually means two dotted crotch two dotted quavers I mean, doesn't it? Cos each group adds up to a dotted quaver.\",\n",
       " \"Mm. So it\\nYeah. As you've got here. That's right. In fact, if anything, which is the easiest way round of doing it? To be, if you're asked to put in a time signature? It's not always so easy to  to group notes. I think people find that more difficult than actually saying what a time signature is.\",\n",
       " \"Mhm. What about that one? Erm\\nTake the simplest bar. Three quavers. So the time signature is? Erm  three eight. Three eight. Now \\nAnd it's grouped in a dotted crotchet. Yes it is. Now is that compound or is that simple? Three eight is simple. It's simple because it's just got three at the top. Mm. It looks as if it ought to be with the compound ones but it's not. It's just an ordinary simple one. But it's quaver beats instead of crotchet beats, that's all. So that was a simple one, that one was a compound one. We'll do one more. What about this one? Is there an easy ? No they're, they're all, virtually all exactly the same\\nErm\\ntiming aren't they? They're not quite the same. two three  four five six\\nYeah. six erm  six four. Yes. Six four which is dotted? Minims. Two dotted minims. Yes, yes. Two dotted minims in a bar. That's one of them. And that, in fact that's probably the simplest bar isn't it? Because\\nMm. that's a group of three. Much the same as a dotted, dotted minim. Erm simple or compound time then? It's \\nSix \\nsix four\\nfour\\nthat's simple. No, compound. Compound. Two, three, four or five would be simple times. Six, twelve  They sound more complicated \\nMm. so think of them as being compound. Right. That way round then isn't so difficult. That I think you  I think most people find it more difficult having to group the notes in the right, in exactly the right way. So  I think. This is actually a grade four one. We'll lead up gradually  to grade five . Yeah. I'm not going to go all the way back through  grades two and three. You started on two I think. Or you've got Book Two. We'll go, we'll go from \\nI think . here. And anything that you find you don't know then we can perhaps go back on just the bits that you don't know. Because you're not going to have to go back on many of the things. This book, these books are quite good because they do give you a little bit of explanation. You've also got er other books or another book at home which you can refer to if you need any extra. Erm it might be an idea to go back. You won't find you're going to take much time doing some of these. If you do exercise one  for the time being don't worry about that one, exercise three. Shall I write it down? Yes, it would be a good idea, wouldn't it? Mm. Do you want to write on the back of  \\nIt would be  because you've already got some in here haven't you? I think I probably \\nYeah. Actually I'll carr I'll carry on on  \\nAnd the date today is  the \\nThe twenty  eighth I think. Ah the twenty eighth. It's the next thing on isn't it ? So if you're looking in the grade four book  put down page four, exercise one. If you have a look at each one of those. Rather than write them in the book, just put the answers down either on a  on a piece of paper. As long as you put clearly what it is you're putting in. Then I can just use these books over and over again. It's a bit pointless writing in them. When it comes to exercise three  that's on page five, exercise three. When it says add bar lines it won it won't hurt you to actually write those out. Because \\nOkay. you really need to group the notes. Well the notes are grouped but you're gonna add the . Write it out because it's all good practice for \\nfor you actually. At er writing out notes as well. So  you can do exercise three. Not that one for now because that's doing something different. Now which are the ones that you've got to  to group?\",\n",
       " \"So far  over here. Right. Page  page eight starts  exercise six. In fact do  all of those. Do A through to F.\\nAnd that's grouping notes  plus the bar lines. The later ones are always quite hard. And they've given you  they've actually given you, not in this one, but they do give you the clefs here. They've given you the clefs. Did we look at those before? Alto clefs and tenor clefs? Er  don't think so. Have you come across those before? come across these. You've come across the treble and the bass right? and the bass, not these alto or whatever. Erm if  just take  just think of singers at the moment. Soprano is the highest, then an alto \\nSoprano, then an alto , tenor, bass \\ntenor and bass. Soprano is the highest voice. Then comes the alto. Then the tenor and then the bass at the . Oh right. So is\\nSo \\nthat's that's alto. So is that  one up from\\nIt's one down from \\nthe treble. Think of it as being the next lot down if you like. Then there would be a tenor clef and then a bass clef. The only reason that, that you're using a different clef is that it's actually putting middle C in a different place. On the stave. So that for example an alto doesn't need so many  notes, high notes, but needs a few more lower notes. So if you just kept your treble clef you'd have a lot of lines possibly that you weren't using at all. And having to add a lot of low ledger line notes. That saves doing that. Because they position middle C.\\nMiddle C's actually positioned between those bits there so the middle line there becomes middle C.\\nWhich means that you're unlikely to have to have quite so many ledger line notes. Although this has got one or two. But not as many as you would have if you were using the treble clef because you'd probably end up with a lot of lower  this is wha , that isn't a particularly good example really because  it hasn't given a lot of lower notes but normally you'd expect to see more notes down on these  lines. Soprano wouldn't go down that far. A soprano would only go down to about  erm  oh about what? Middle C is probably a bit too low for, for most sopranos. But an alto would go a lot lower, would go down probably to an F or a G.\\nSo that these notes would be low. If that's middle C you can te what would the bottom line actually be? Bottom line? That's C\\nEr it would\\nIt's here. er G.\\nC A F, you're right, yes. Erm so that in fact  a true alto would be using most of the notes there. And just a few ledger lines above. Unlikely to be using  whereas if they were using the treble clef for most of the time   \\nF G.\\nYes. And then the other one, the tenor clef. Have they given you a tenor clef? No. They'll give you a tenor clef a little bit further on. They may not actually put the tenor clef in till grade  grade five now I come to think about that. But there's no point in\\nNot learning it \\nabout it now because it's  just as easy really. Tenor clef looks exactly the same but middle C is now there. Next line up in fact. So  because a tenor sings a little bit lower  you've got more of the lower notes and fewer of the higher  notes before you need to add  start adding ledger line notes. Sometimes of course you'll, they'll still need ledger line notes up there. And perhaps one down there but  not very likely. So it's just to make it much more comfortable to look at. Just means you have to get used to thinking, right if that's  if, if that's er er a tenor clef then that note won't be  it would be, be an A in a bass clef and F in a treble clef. What will it be for that clef? In this  erm  oh \\nGoing downwards going backwards is, is more difficult isn't it? Yeah. Much easier working upwards from C.\\nThat line's C.\\nSo that line \\nC. \\nwould be? C A F D\\nEr C A  E  You go one below it. Oh yeah. You know F is next in fact C yes. That's A, that's F, that would be D so it's between the two which, which is an E.\\nAnd if you were going above of course, that note would be? E.\\nE and remember that it's the E just above middle C.\\nAnd that's the E\\nDoes the middle C \\nalways come up on a line?\",\n",
       " \"Well it's  yes it does in fact. Mm. I hadn't actually thought of that before. But yes it does seem to. I suppose theoret theoretically you could actually move middle C to wherever you wanted to have it. But generally speaking they us they use just the four clefs. Now  certain instruments use the  alto clef. Just a minute. Hello. Oh hello. Alright. Right I'll fetch him, I'll fetch him. Yes he's here. Oh somewhere he is. He's jus just upstai he's just upstairs so I shan't be a moment I'll go and call him . Gosh she's going to have fun with this tape.\",\n",
       " \"Go on out you go. Right  Yes. So middle C then can be almost anywhere. Yeah. What instrument  do you know about  do you think  that uses something other than the treble clef  and a bass clef? Or have you come across the one that\\nErm  instrument that I know. Well that, that you might know. It's not actually a percussion one but it's er  in fact I don't, I think most of the percussion ones tend to use a  a bass clef don't they? Yeah, yeah. If you see one at all. Yeah or  erm  xylophones  and glocks and those. Except they use treble and bass \\nThey use the treble don't they? Yes. Er  Bass or whatever. Yeah. Xylophone. Yes, it's a treble. And a vibraphone? Just   I've got one of those nice little  \\nYes. It's just like a, a small  sort of piano. Doesn't have a very long \\nkey keyboard. It doesn't I don't think. Quite an \\nIt's a piano and it's \\nodd range. It's very high. Because in fact although it's written from there all the way up to there, erm  that is it starts at the C above middle C and goes up \\nYeah. to very high  the unfortunate thing \\nsnare drum. I think that's played  on the bass  what would be on the piano an A. Yes. It, it, they \\nuse cert certain lines don't they? They use yeah erm  \\nSo that you, you get to know what is \\nI think it's er\\nwhat is what. A is the bass drum. Yeah. er\\nI think it's G they use as the high-hat and there's all sorts of things. Yeah. I don't thing they  one thing they don't give in this book is a complete score\\nYeah. which  oh do they? No they don't. No. Which of course I'll ask yeah I've got plenty of those sort \\nMm. of things anyway. You have to know an awful lot you know for grade five. You, you've gotta have quite a wide knowledge. You, you don't have to, need to know anything in, in depth but you've got to know \\nBut you've got to know shallow a wider range. Yes that's right which means in a way that you've got to know quite a lot. There's  erm an alto, no, yes an alto clef, isn't it? For  trombone, no, it's not, it's for, yes it's for one of the trombones, isn't it? Tuba. Oh I erm found out what that  brass instrument we couldn't think of. What was it? Euphonium. Euphon yes. You're erm   isn't it silly\\nMm. I've, I've \\nbecause  you see I could see wh exactly what you were talking about in my mind \\nMm. but I could not think of its name. Yeah. I got into the car and I was still erm thinking all about this \\nIt's, it's, yeah. and my mother said straight away, oh you're thinking of a euphonium.\",\n",
       " \"Yeah. That's the one. Yes. It's so silly isn't it when er  you know that you knew it all the time. Now then. The one I'm looking for is what, have I got to the strings yet? No I haven't got back to the strings. These just use the bass or the treble clef.\",\n",
       " \"And when you get back  to the    There we are. The strings. It's the viola that we're actually looking for. Sort of bass violin. Sort of bass violin, yes . There we are. That's the one that uses it. So that you see even in a score it would be written like that. So that's the only, only instrument that you generally see, actually see using it  in most, most schools.

On minute one one four, I'm using my privilege as a chair to hang on to that; the fact that the Poly are to hold a conference on health and housing in the new year. I've asked that members be invited to that, I'm sure some of you'd be interested to do that. You may recall that this committee has asked for a health and housing conference but we seem to get under it rather a lot of times, nothing it appears to be happening. Can I have your agreement that we write to the director of housing and ask for his position on it? Will you agree that we do that, rather than have the same thing coming up time after time. Anything else on page one? Also on that, chair, just to clarify the situation, because I know it's a bit vague, we are erm asking the health authority to run the erm meeting with other local authority counties, do you remember? The referral agency's to be in B? Right, lovely. We're doing that. Great, thank you very much indeed for that. On page 2, matters arising. Sheila? One one six, chair. I would like to congratulate the officers for that day. It was a very educational day, but extremely harrowing afternoon, which is still living with me. And I would like to say at this point I was very disappointed that we didn't have any other conservatives with us in the afternoon. Could I suggest probably in future that if we do that we have the harrowing parts in the morning so everybody can see it. Can I say about that little dig at the conservatives, I did actually have \\nNo, we were expressing our sorrow, Graham, I assure you\\nYes, well, I have had a recent case, erm of within the ward that I visited, so I am aware of having the number of problems in the past, I am aware of the problems, but I could not for personal circumstances do the afternoon that day. I understand, Graham\\nI do rather resent it when there are other council committees, there's Town Hall Strategy Working Party in the afternoon, now if we're going to be sure that we can all get to this without conflict with other committees, erm I had to be there on behalf of the Lord Mayor because she had duties, erm and I was very sorry not to be able to come, because I have dealt, visited many  occupational, I wanted to visit the officers, and you know, it isn't always possible where you have a conflict of interests. Is it possible perhaps if when we have another day, I take the point that perhaps the morning's but then again we're bound to miss something else, If we can have it a day that is clear of other city councils \\nIt may be \\nCould meet before \\nthat if we pass on some of your comments at the end of the section, maybe they'll be able to arrange, maybe in two or three months time a visit that most of us can make, particularly those of you who missed it, because it is an important experience, but obviously quite difficult to arrange, because it involves real tenants and real people but we can pass that back, and I'm sure the officers will consider it. Chair, erm on that, if that could be arranged in two or three months time, perhaps we can see how the Charter of Commerce is working out, because I think many of us are very interested to see how it is working out, we could erm discuss with somebody who's in bed-and-breakfast, who could then erm tell us how the Charter of Commerce is working. Very appropriate remark, Michael, the charter is up for review at any event, very shortly, because it was on a six-month trial as it were. So I agree with that, thank you. Page three? Yes, on page three, one twenty, chair, we asked for a date, the date of that conference is the thirteenth and fourteenth of December. That's probably helping Nora. It's not on the minutes, but just to remind you, the thirteenth and fourteenth of December, thanks Tony. Is it to be in the Town Hall? Is it in the Town Hall, Tony? Blessed if I can remember, chair, no. In St Catherine's, Vice Chair suggests. Page four? On page five, those of you who were at the last council meeting will know that the City Centre Management Working Party were charged with the responsibility of looking at the whole issue of street trading. They have now done that and they will be making a report, I hope, fairly shortly, either to us or  or both. On item four on page five, you'll see that we said ‘relevant papers to be sent to all members of council’. Pragmatically, I suggested to the officers that a summary of those papers be sent to all members of council in the interests of saving paper, and that if you see something you want to know more about, you then go and talk to David Turner, is that agreeable? Otherwise you will be inundated with paper. Item one two four, Highways and Traffic do not agree with us on touting. And I'm sure we shall sit quietly over that. Page six, Matters Arising, page seven, yes? I was just going to ask if we have a diary? Tony? Not at this stage, chair, next committee you should have.\",\n",
       " \"Thank you. Okay? Can we use item one two nine on the minutes, first of all to say that some of us were at the H I V awareness training session last week, with Robin, we enjoyed it enormously, she's hiding behind the thing. Looking for the right word! So we want to say ‘thank you very much’ to Robin, and also, this is our opportunity to learn officially that Robin is leaving our employment, I think in February? Yes. And it's an opportunity for her and me to say a couple of words to us, and for us certainly to thank her very much for her service. I just wanted to let you know that in February, won't be hiding behind an OHP, erm I'll be taking up a post with the European Commission, working with Aids services throughout Europe. erm I'm very sad to be leaving Oxford, I've very much enjoyed working here, and it's been good to work for a council with such a high commitment to H I V, and to fighting Aids, and erm I very much the support I've had from the committee and I hope it will continue erm in this way. So thank you very much. I'm sure Health committee's commitment to the post will continue. And I'm sure I speak on behalf of you all when I say thank you very much indeed to Robin, you've done an excellent job, and we shall miss you. Thanks. Can I chair just draw your attention to one or two items. I hope this committee will, since everybody else is doing it, yet again, my absolute, the officers and the management on Northway Community Centre\\nIt's on the agenda Betty, you'll have another bite at this cherry.\",\n",
       " \"Oh is it? Yes\\nOh, sorry, right. Anything else on page seven? Most items are on the agenda, actually. On page eight, item one three two, can I draw committee's attention to, says she, feverishly flicking through the pieces of paper, to a letter that John Patten has written to us, you'll see what we asked Amanda to do on our behalf, Amanda Root, Women's Sub also asked her to do that, and John Patten, surprisingly enough has written back, his private secretary has written back, she continues to say, ‘Mr Patten is used to getting communications from Chief Officers conveying the views of committees, he has never had any correspondence from Sub-Committees through other officers’. Now, I wonder whether the opposition members might not like to take that up with their M P.\\nI think an MP is there to respond to correspondence, and I'm very surprised that he takes issue with one of our officers because she doesn't happen to be the Chief Officer, and I'm very sad about that. Can I just ask, I'm not usually a member of this committee as you know. So you might be out-of-order in speaking, in fact. Can I say that sub-committees, as I understand it, report to main committees? Yes they do. So, in fact, had that decision gone to the main committee, or is it going, is it coming here now. This was a decision of main committee, on page eight. I understood it in fact from what you said that it was a decision of the sub-committee. Women's sub also happened to say the same thing. Yes, Mavis? Sorry, if I could just clarify, I was actually at the meeting of Women's Sub, erm as was Robin in fact, and they, the Women's Sub-Committee considered the minute of this committee, and endorsed erm, in fact, Amanda didn't write until the meeting of women's sub, because it was being considered by them, but erm they didn't add anything substantial to what was this committee had said and they did. I just think it is, in fact, a great shame that the MP only acknowledges some letters if they happen to have the kind of status that he appreciates. I don't think there's a defence for that. Betty? Well, he seems to have been conspicuous by has absence in respect to these things. He has been invited to talk to other committees in the past and has decided not to do so. Now, I don't take very kindly to that. Whatever he thinks of the political make-up of this council, he owes a duty to the city and to his council. And I think this is a an another example of how little he seems to care for this city. Well, on the specific issue, which is item one three two, are we agreed that we write quite clear but nonetheless firm letter to Mr Patten, explaining that we are minded to ask him to comment on these matters, it this time comes from the Chair and the Chief Officer about and perhaps he will therefore take it more seriously. Are we agreed that we do that? Graham? I was just going to say that I'm sure he it's not that he didn't take it seriously. It may well be he felt that there wasn't necessarily the full authority of the city council and administration sub committee. Now clearly, he responds every day to individuals of the public. Here, I can only think that he was saying, ‘well, we don't know that there's the full authority of the city council in this view’, but erm I'm not going to put up a defence, I just think that what we do is basically stress from yourself and from the chief officer that we do want this file known. Could I have a copy of the letter, please, can I take it up? You certainly can, Anne, thank you. Other matters arising on page eight, you'll see on item one three four that we did investigate the possibility, did we, have we got a response on that, of an officer being part of the joint care planning team. I wonder if the county have responded to that, yet? We haven't had a response. We haven't got a response, fine, okay. Item eight, any more Matters Arising? Item, erm sorry, page nine, on the Food Safety Act, we did write, the Chief did write, to Andrew Smith, to ask about the position on the Food Safety Act, as far as monies go, and I will read you the response, it was a question in parliament. ‘The Government has estimated that local authorities in England will need to spend twenty four point seven million pounds in ninety-one, ninety-two to carry out the additional duties resulting from the Food Safety Act. This additional cost is being taken into account in a total of aggregate external finance. The post to be twenty-six point oh five billion which will be distributed to Local Authorities on the basis of standard spending assessments. My Right Honourable Friend will be announcing our imposing Standard Spending Assessments in the near future.’\\nThe implications for us are that we shall have to find it very hard to ensure that we get a share of that grant to spend on implementation of the Food Safety Act. I would suggest that the government would be a lot, lot better adding a ticket to amounts of money, which said ‘You either spend this money on implementing the Food Safety Act, or you don't get it.’\\nFuture Labour Government's committed itself to doing that, and I would suggest that the Secretary of State should do it, because we're not guaranteed to receive that money at all. erm Anything else on page nine? erm On Nestlé, Chief's reminded me that we have got, I received today, a long letter from Nestlé, basically saying they won't be coming today. I shall make that letter available to the solicitor who we have asked to check out with Estates, and with other authorities regarding the way forward, if we wish to make any public statements about our dealings with Nestlé. I'm not putting it around the table, because it's a very long letter, and I don't think we could have a worthwhile discussion on it right now. Yes, chair,actually gave it to this headed copy of it to consolidate erm with regard to contacting Leicester and Leeds Councils that have also sort of taken action against Nestlé, that's still being done. The officer at Leicester's not available at the moment, so he hopes by the next meeting erm if Leeds have an opportunity to see that letter, and perhaps have a short report on what this council does with respect to Nestle/1  and also what other councils have done. Michael? Yes, erm, going back to the original thing that brought this up, that we should descry people from using Nestlé's products, erm, in fact implications will be quite wide, because they now own Rowntrees, and they own Cross and Blackwells, and they own all sorts of other companies. Now, is it the intention of the people who asked us to take this action that we should just boycott Nestles products, or we should do the whole range of the conglomerate that owns all these people like Rowntrees and Cross and Blackwell, and many other companies as well. Because this, erm, I think it's quite far-reaching to erm get all hot on this, and I don't think we realised the full implications. Yes, the implications are very heavy, I had not realised what you'd just said, and we should refer that to Amanda and indeed take all take it on board, otherwise we'll be taking on the world. Yes, probably should. And probably should, yes. Item one four oh, believe it or not, Doctor Root did write to Mr Patten on this issue, and guess what he wrote back? ‘I've received a letter from your Health Promotion erm Liaison Officer, can I ask you if this was sent on your behalf?’\\n‘On which committee meeting was the letter considered?’, he doesn't trust anybody, this guy, does he? I propose the same action again. He's obviously keen on structures and procedure is the Right Honourable Gentleman \\nMust be a past experience! Yes. Well, he's taking a lot longer and costing us a lot more money in terms of letting us know his view. Actually, to comply with the minute, it should go to the City Environmental Chief Officer. Yes. Well, as you know, we always say the City Environmental Health Officer, and the officer responsible then does the work, we've seen to that on our committee for years \\nIf you look at a department like the Director and Engineers department, every letter in fact has underneath it the City Engineer, even if its signed by somebody else. I mean it is a possibility, and if he's going to be awkward perhaps we'll have to just make sure that we do that, which is presumably fairly easy, if the post goes out from the same office. I take your point Anne, but I would prefer to help the MP understand that the nature of the way that this department is run is that officers do take responsibility for their specialist areas of work, the senior management has always supported that, and I don't feel minded to change it because the MP finds it difficult. Well, I certainly will take it up if I get a copy letter, I mean it is obviously that some departments act differently, and I understand that in any case this is only a letter from the secretary, it's not him, so I mean, I'm quite happy to take it up if I get the copy of that, and explain that this department act, does rather differently from some of the others. And we shall certainly do that as well. Chair, the letters that do go, the majority of the letters that go to MPs and members are signed by me, though they're prepared by the officer who's the expert in different fields, but these two letters went when I happened to be away from the department, and that's fair enough, I'd rather they went than sat around waiting for my return. But, they also go on headed note paper which says Oxford City Council Environmental Health Department and all the other stuff we put on the top, erm and it's perfectly clear that they do come from the City Department upon your behalf. He's being awfully bumptious, let's be honest. Chair, can I just help you here recently, because we've had a recent case ourselves erm, this is an ironic twist to this, because Councillor Patten's being writing to the County on Highway and Traffic issues recently and sending us a copy, and it's stunned us a little bit, because normally they would write to us direct, but there's a sting in this because we don't know whether we're supposed to respond to him now, or   the county. And the county don't send us copy letters, so, chair it does need sorting out as far as we're concerned as well. It really does doesn't it. I can see the Press headline: ‘MP with knickers in twist’Anything else on page ten. Okay, apologies for absence and substitution. Chair, I have none, I'm afraid. May I say that Mrs Kurtz, I would have thought has sent her apologies, and I'm substituting for her \\nSorry, I should explain to the committee that I was informed that the secretary who normally does the minutes for the half past one was sick, and had, she'd been sent home by her doctor at lunch time, so I came back from lunch and had to come straight into committee, and I do apologize if I have missed bits of paper or whatever, I've gathered up everything I could, but that might well be one of the things that I've left behind. We accept that Councillor Kurtz would be honourable in these matters, do we accept Councillor Tiffany as her substitute. Yes\\nThey're not saying a lot are they? I had erm I was going to be representative of this committee at a erm safety seminar for three days at the beginning of this week that I wasn't able to go to, and Councillor Kurtz has very kindly gone in my place, which is why she is not able to come to this meeting. Ah, well in that case \\nWe do appreciate that explanation. No, I think sometimes it's forgotten not all that many, you know, these remarks about us not being there. There's not many of you! Only three that can be there and \\nWe're quite happy that there's not many of you Anne! Okay, so we accept that Councillor Tiffany is now substituting Councillor Kurtz and may now take her full part in the meeting. Can I just ask your permission for our proceedings this afternoon to be tape recorded by Caroline, and I've forgotten where you come from, Caroline? From the University Press, from Oxford University Press. From the Oxford University Press. Will you need to know why she needs to tape record? Thought you might! Yes. Would you like to tell us, Caroline? Yes, it's for the dictionary project, we're doing a, erm we're trying to build up a database at the moment of transcribed spoken language. We're happy to take part in that! Could we have that repeated, please, I didn't hear it. She's of the dictionary project that's looking at transcribed spoken language. Oh, we'll have to be careful, then, won't we! You may have to be careful. Perhaps you ought to tell her that John Patten is no longer with the environmental health.\",\n",
       " \"He is in fact. Is he still there? Haven't seen him for about two weeks. So we're all happy about that? Approved duties. You'll probably need help filling round here. I was going to say, I have no idea, unless there's, if they're on the agenda, I'll pick them up and see, if there's anything else, you'll have tell me about it I'm afraid, chair. I'm not immediately aware of anything else, but members, please rack your brains as we go through, Diana? You gave us, you gave us some dates on page three, item one hundred and twenty, thirteenth and fourteenth of December. I believe we've taken a decision on that for the health conference, last time round. I've got one on page eighty-one, but we'll come to it on pollution control. They're are some others too, chair, on the seminars and conferences we've listed. We can do on the way through, okay. I think there is no urgent business. erm Well, as I understand it there is a report on the authorization of officers, which is urgent business. Ah, that's right, sorry \\nYes, chair, and I don't have copies and, you do? Well, I have some, I thought they'd gone round, but this is, erm sorry \\nChair, it was one officer whom we've got on staff at the moment  Karen Wheeler who's away nursing her new baby, and it's to authorize that officer to carry out certain roles under the health and safety \\nCan you circulate that, the committee is accustomed to seeing it. I don't think it should cause you any problems, but it is something that's come on late erm as a result of maternity cover. Right. Ian Waterhouse is with us, probably wondering how on earth these meetings get off the ground at all. Ian, you're the community services manager. We have a paper from you on, can we settle down a bit. We have a paper from you on page eleven. Can I ask you to limit yourself to some five minutes. I apologize for that, that, but we have a very heavy agenda, and members start falling asleep around five, and if people have questions or comments, perhaps they . Welcome to our committee, and we hope we'll be working together in the future. Thank you, yes, erm thank you very much for inviting me to attend to those meetings and giving me the opportunity to meet you all. Having worked for a number of years now in community health services, previously erm in Yorkshire, in fact I've only been down in Oxford about four or five months, I've learnt how important it is in fact to make good working contacts with members and officers of other organizations, and particularly of local authority organizations. I'm therefore doubly grateful to you for giving me the chance to meet you today, and I hope that some of the contacts I might make today will stand me in good stead in the job that I'm doing in Oxford over the next year or so. I have sent round a briefing paper, and rather than go right through that, what I'd just like to do is to highlight two or three things about myself and about the post that I now hold, and I would be pleased to answer any questions that you might have during the next two or three minutes. Firstly, just to set my own context, I've been in the health service now for just over twenty year. I went into the service in nineteen seventy as a national trainee, and I'm therefore coming from the administrative branch of the service. I'm not a qualified nurse, or a health care professional. I'm an administrator by background, and I think that's interesting, because one of the things that we are trying to do in the health service is to open up our management posts to people of all professions, and to recognise that management is not the prerogative of any particular group, but that we're looking for the right people to manage our services from wherever they might come, and I'm one of three people who has a responsibility to the senior manager in the community at the top, for the managing on a day-to-day basis the health services in Oxfordshire. Of those two colleagues, interestingly enough, one is a health visitor by background, the other is a nurse, but someone who practised or hasn't practised, but as a district health community planner for a number of years. So you can see that we have quite a mixture of people in terms of our backgrounds professionally. The purpose of general management is to try and ensure that in the city that we are getting the best value we can from the health resources that are in the city, and I have the authority now, and the responsibility to spend the budget that I've had allocated from the Oxfordshire Health Authority, by Gerald Simon who's the general manager. So a big change in the way that we are arranged has actually come about through the general management structure, and we're hoping that this will give us more room, if you like  to start looking at priorities, and to move the budget around in accordance with our feelings about those priorities. In that task I am assisted by a team of six managers, all of whom are professional nurses and district nurses or health visitors and they of course are there to advise me on professional issues, and to share with me the management task of using the resources of Oxford City in the way that we feel is best appropriate, and in doing that, I think one of the important things for us to do, I don't think we do it quite as well as we should, is to work more closely with the local council, and to look really at what the needs of our local communities are for health, and to try and make sure that the feelings that might well be expressed by individuals, either individually, or through caring associations, or through other statutory agencies, or through voluntary health organisations, are actually given a chance to be there, and to influence our, that official policy and constituents , and to, to influence the planning process. I've made a note of a potting of that briefing paper to you. I personally see this is as one of my major objectives over the next year or so, and in a sense it makes me trebly grateful to be here today, because I hope some of the contacts I might make today will enable me to work alongside you in what might be called even local Berkshire band, and to try and get more a multiplicity of views from different organisations channelled through our own value objectives. And it is the exciting part of my job is to make these links work, start to build on them, and over our links in the city on the environmental and  group with Tony Benn , that's that's doing a very good job, he is a platform for this, for each other, but I think there's a lot more we can do locally erm within the city to build those links, and to work together for better answers for the city, and I hope that, on a practical level, one of the things that interested me was your grants team for local organisations, and I would like to think  myself here today, we might look at the health authority, and try to join with them to make some erm practical contribution, particularly to those many carers, and groups of people who have problems, and we're not all just professionals best able to put over during our normal nine-to-five or eight-to-eight days, we  we can. There's a lot we can do, I think, to help the community in a wider sense, and I see that as one of the key elements of my work, to try and make that work. And I'm not too concerned with the day-to-day management of individual professionals, I've got a team to help me do that. What concerns me is looking at the  and trying to forge new creative links with other organisations, statutory and voluntary, in the best health interests of Oxfordshire residents. That I think is my main concern, with a request in a sense to you for supporting that over the next year or so, because I'll be trying to perhaps get invited to the meetings, and perhaps we'll be inviting officers from the authority to join me in looking at ways of building up that local context in planning to get that into our formal planning systems. That will be my key message, and the other thing I'd like to emphasise today, and I'd be very grateful for some sort of early response to that. I have discussed it with Dorothy Tomkin I think we have a genuine desire to move to a more authority-based planning system, erm, we haven't got the methods of doing that yet, and I turn to C B S and to local authority and to the traditional carers for them to join us in that. So thank you for giving me the chance to, to air that view. There are means to get a response and I'm grateful to take the temperature of the water. Right. The temperature of the water will inevitably be variably, and I'm sure we certainly welcome, lots of people will welcome your philosophical position. I would say just two things; the one on the rates scheme, we certainly as a health committee distribute fifteen thousand pounds a year and treat these as important pledge by work. We can't deliberately do not maintain those voluntary groups which we feel are appropriately and better funded by the health authority. The health authority has for years not shown any signs of so doing, I have to say. I don't want to be cynical at this stage, but years of experience that show that the health authority has no intention of doing that. And the other thing to say to from me is yes, we would love a multiplicity of views to go to the District Health Authority, I and my predecessor Betty Stanford, who were District Council Members on that health authority, we were there and able to listen to and able to contribute to the debate, the Government White Paper has taken us off, so that is not a good start in terms of how you involve the city and the district with the policy decisions of the health authority. So that's my bit of bad news. I can see Arthur, Betty and Liz. Chairman, may I first of all declare an interest in this. erm Under the new erm system erm every G P must at some time during the  visit erm persons over seventy-five. Now, what are you doing to ensure that erm that this is carried out because a lot of elderly, they will not go to the doctor, but erm the doctor I believe has got to go and see them. Now, what are you doing to really see this is getting off the ground? Well, I \\nIan, can I ask you to save the questions and respond at the end, otherwise you'll find the discussion takes much longer, is that alright? Although that may not be appropriate  view of that, but, Betty? I was going to raise the very question you raised. There we were as representatives of this city, people who are in contact with erm people who have got problems, we were \\nCan you press your button, Betty? in my view thrown off without any reasonable excuse, because I felt that I could bring a lot of expertise to the health authority. They may not have thought of it as expertise, but when people said to me a particular ward is dirty, I went and looked at it, and in a very short time, within about ten minutes, that ward had got a massive clean-up team in there, that's the sort of thing that I felt was useful. That being said, I mean, you've lost now local, local erm expertise there. What I want to ask is, firstly, who are you funded by, and these teams, I note erm paragraphs three erm these nurses and so on, are they existing staff, or is this a new team, erm management team which has been set up at yet more expense to the health authority? So, basically, I want to know are they taken from erm a team which is already in the health service, or are they new posts funded, and funded by whom, bearing in mind the constant complaints we get from the health authority about lack of funds?\",\n",
       " \"Thank you, Betty. Liz? Thank you. I'm finding myself somewhat confused, I mean, I was interested that Ian had mentioned the practical voluntary services as one of the groups that he would wish to work with. I think that recently we seem to have had such, so many changes in the health authority, so many different peoples in the post who all seem to be doing the same sort of thing, who've got the Family Health Services Authority set up, but it would seem to me that some of the things that are on this piece of paper are things that I understood were being done by the Family Health Services Authority. We have a joint planning officer, and we've got quite a lot of joint erm of joint planning going on between the voluntary sector and the Health Authority and the Social Services. We've got a whole erm, a whole erm organisation  that in fact the Council for Voluntary Service only this week made an appointment with a very, very, very, very small amount of money that's been made available on a very, very part-time basis, to actually assist with that, with the planning that's going on in the voluntary sector. And I think that we're constantly hearing about new people, new systems of working. erm New people who are being put in posts to liaise and to do this, that and the other, with a shrinking voluntary sector. With a voluntary sector that is erm constantly needing small amounts of resource in order to deliver an enormous amount of service to vulnerable people. And I think that the time will come some point, when the voluntary sector will say, ‘Well, we actually don't have time to talk erm to carry on talking about what we're doing and how we're doing it. We actually much prefer to get on with what we're there to do, and to, to offer services, to find, to find ways of supporting vulnerable people. So, I think my questions are, one, where does this post fit in the Family Health Services Authority? Two, how does it fit in with the Joint Planning Officer who's also ready in post?,\\nThree, how will it fit in with all the locality planning and all the work that's already been done in joint planning between the voluntary sector and the local authority and the health authority. Thank you very much, Liz. We'll keep you going all afternoon at this rate, won't we Ian. I've seen Anne and Nonnie and I don't particularly want to see anybody else. I'm glad Liz is confused because as one of her predecessors I'm also confused. I mean, you know, we've lived with this planning. There's always been planning with the people on planning, and it seems to me that the paragraph that begins ‘A key area’, we've got some more planning. And I think really what's needed is actually going out, I mean, it could be a useful new thing that, a new departure that other people haven't done. In other words not sitting there and asking people to, erm people in authority, erm sort of people of influence, ask them what they think, but actually going out and visiting people and groups, and I was going to ask whether this would be copied to the women's sub-committee, because there are many, many groups of women who never have a chance of saying what they really want, and I don't mean patients, I mean potential users of the health service. erm The Health Service has been very much male-orientated. I'm very glad to see that there's quite a lot of nurses here, and I presume that quite a lot of those are women nurses, and I think that this is terribly important, and I think a useful thing with this new service could do is to go out and talk for instance to the meetings of women's organisations, to old peoples' clubs in the afternoon, and actually ask people what they would like, and get them talking in a nice informal way, rather than waiting for somebody to let them know what they think, because I don't think they're going to get it. So, I think that would be a useful thing for a new planning section to do. erm My ears pricked up when Mr Waterhouse did in fact say, I though he said that it wasn't necessarily help in monetary terms, but some of these people might be willing to help in kind, or in sort of helping as people with some voluntary organisations, and I think, if that was what he meant, I think there again that might be very useful, because voluntary organisations are always looking for people to help.\",\n",
       " \"So those are my few comments, thank you. Thank you Anne. Nonnie? As someone who has to ask occasionally for a care package for an individual, do I take it then the penultimate paragraph that this is the planning, you know, how you're going to produce a care package for an individual, this is what you refer to in the planning system, and that you're getting together with Social Services to get this care package together? Yes, Okay? Would you like to tackle that lot in the best way you can? Thank you, yes, erm to take the final point in terms of care packages, yes, are officers are working on, Social Services officers, on the professional care assistant care packages. Yes, but at what level? Do you yet know at what level that's going to be organised? I don't know. You don't know, so that's part of the planning system that we're working on? The working groups are currently on working on that, and they, my colleagues  I assume are talking to the the officers of the Social Services about that, what is happening, but the final outcome has yet to appear. Just answering the first question on assessment of the over seventy-fives, that in fact really should be better left for the  to say. I'm not part of the  organisation. They have a responsibility for managing the U G B Contract, and you quite rightly said that one of the arguments on that contract, assessments of the over seventy-fives. I belong to the Community Oxford Health Authority not to the Family Health Services Authority, so that's just to clarify that, that did cover two questions that I was asked. In terms of Primary Health Care teams, they are existing members of staff, or health visitors attached to General Practices, and we call that collaboration if you like . In terms of a planning process Anne was talking about, you'll have to forgive me for being relatively new to Oxfordshire and coming from an area where we had a planning system which was largely the one I was describing, and the planning role that I saw I wanted to develop was very much already mentioned which was actually going round to small groups of people, to the local caring groups on a much more informal basis, and getting their contribution about that and then feeding it back into the system, which you say is there in a sense. I don't think it's rooted firmly enough in the localities. And it's that part of the jigsaw that I want to concentrate on. So if there's anything, there's a slightly different approach to it, and one thing that we are being urged to do, through the very way in which you mentioned in another context, is to make sure that facilities are appropriate locally, and developing policies within that. I don't make any apologies for that, and maybe it is going over the old ground, but unless we do it, unless we try to do it, if we've done it the way before been and it hasn't produced what we, what we want, then surely it's not for us to sit back and say, ‘Well, it's been through that and it hasn't worked’, surely we ought to try again, and that's what I hope to be doing, sort of value your support and see you . Yes, can I say to you that what you're hearing is members' experiences of the past. mhm\\nI'm not sure that you'll be able to uncover dinosaurs as it were. Well, no, but I \\nBut of course in terms of partnership, you will have our support and any way we can aid and abet you then we shall do that, erm but you can tell from the questions and comments that we have some distress about the \\nYes, I get that, yes \\nIan, thanks ever so much, it's not necessarily been an easy ride for you, but we're glad to know you and we look forward to meeting you again. Yes, well, I hope so, we can sort of work it out. I'm sure of it. Thank you very much indeed. Bye\\nThanks, bye bye. You can stay of course! Don't blame you! Can I just draw your attention to your item on Urgent Business. Do you all have sight of that? It's headed up ‘Appointments and Authorization of officers’ and you're asked to authorize Stephen Stansfield, a non-professional health technician, as detailed in para. 2, it's a very normal and routine bit of work for you. Are you agreed? Agreed. So that we can get on with this work. Thank you very much indeed. On to item six and seven. You'll remember we do this on an annual basis. It's very efficiently organised for us to do. We've got Keith Dryer here, I think, of the engineers. Keith, would you like to press your button and introduce us to item six, street collections in Oxford. Thanks, Chair. Basically, the latest, and I mustn't take any credit, and there seemed to be some credit, Chair. This lady on my right, Katherine Powell, does all the hard work and committee reports, and I thought it only fair to bring her here today, because she's the person that does the set fifty-threes,\\nShe does? She's one of the members you can come to. So Katherine can answer the details on the report. Right. Welcome, Katherine. I didn't realize that's who you are. I'm the one who'll always be late getting a reply back on the set fifty threes! So Katherine, do you want to say anything on the report at this stage? I'd just like to point out that erm on the street collections as you've always done before, AvaRag and NovaSports don't generally get passed, because they don't actually help anybody in Oxford. Right\\nThat's the only thing I'd like to bring to your attention. So, you can confirm for us that NovaSports are still in that position, and I think some of us understand the nature of Avarag. Yes, erm they've got a sports centre in Nottingham, and that's the nearest thing they've got to Oxford. Thank you for saying that to us, yes, I wouldn't have actually picked it up. Chair, can I just ask, I mean, so it's organisations that are Oxfordshire rather than Oxford City. Yes. That's tended to be our line. They've not been tested solely on that, but it's on the question. Well, unless people have specific to Katherine, as I say it's presented in such a way, this report, that essentially we're asked to agree the number of permits to match the number of applications. I would suggest to the committee on page sixteen on our recommendations that we do make the point about Avarag and NovaSports, just in terms of consistency, and I would expect you to want to continue to do that. So does that mean we still grant twenty-three Saturday city centre permits? That doesn't alter that position, Katherine? No, Well, it will go down to twenty-one. Quite. Could I ask on page seventeen about Blue Cross? We have got erm some organisations, the ones I can think of is the Animal Sanctuary that we are all familiar with. erm I, does Blue Cross have any connection with Oxfordshire? Yes, they've got a farm in Burford. Ahh. Can I ask that you agree on eight one A to grant them twenty-one Saturday city centre permits, and you're clear that you've left out NovaSports and AvaRag, and you understand why? Graham? I have a great deal of sympathy with all these organisations anyway, and the tremendous number of volunteers that come out on the days. I'm just wondering whether in fact every Saturday that you've got, bearing in mind this is not flag days, this is in the street. Yes, these are street collections. That we really are putting a tremendous number of people on the street over the course of the year, erm that the general public are facing. And while I think we ought to do what we can, I think there's a line which ought to be drawn, and I do honestly wonder whether twenty-one, it was eighteen last year, and I just wonder if perhaps we should erm try and switch some of these to mid-week, so that we're not seeing it virtually every Saturday of the year. Okay, Betty? I just wanted to say to you, firstly I declare an interest in OxRad, not pecuniary, of course, with money, however, but it is on behalf of charities, it is the only way they can generally raise some two three hundred pounds in a day, or sometimes a little more, that is a tremendous help to charities. And I think that erm twenty-one is nothing like too many, in fact that's not even half a year. It doesn't mean that in fact that erm that there are twenty, my maths are right, that does mean that there are thirty one \\nThirty-one. Where there is not a collection, I think that's perfectly reasonable. Well, of course, there's flag days as well . Yes, well then we're also making provision for disaster funds coming up, emergency funds. Can I say that we are now organising quite tightly the business of street collections, and I think if committee are minded to reduce the number of collections that we allow, we should decide that before we come to this meeting, because I think it's very difficult in practical terms to do it at this stage, and therefore I would suggest that we do agree twenty-one, not withstanding what Graham said, we can take on board some of what he said, and maybe the month before we are asked to take this decision, we have an item on the agenda where we discuss the principle before we get down to the practicalities. Would that suit you for the time being, Graham? I think so, It made me feel that some actually seem to be quite keen to have suburban or mid-week, even though they've had city centre ones in the past. Some clearly want to switch to city centre. But I did think that it might just ease the pressure on Saturdays, because, following what erm Betty has said, in fact, as I make it it's forty-five Saturdays out of fifty-two, and bearing in mind Bank Holiday weekend, Christmas and that sort of thing, it's virtually every Saturday in the city centre there is a collection. Now that's fine, but I know some people who are in the city centre every, on Saturday, feel very guilty if they're not constantly giving, and I do think we want to get that balance. Clearly we want to support the charities, and the organisations but erm. I was just going to make a quick comment if I may on Oxfam, because I noticed that they're down for the street collections and for the flag day, now next year's their fiftieth anniversary, so I think it's quite appropriate next year, but I do, my own view is, that we will get, we ought to get one comprehensive list of all these organisations, for both the street collections and the flag days, with an indication in the column of whether it's flag day they've gone for or a street collection, so that we can identify that sort of situation. Right, I mean, that seems quite sensible actually. I would just like to point out that suburban and mid-week flag day erm street collections alternate with the city centre the following year. That was committee decision a number of years ago. Right, Anne. I think there does come a point when there is resistance. I mean, we all know that having to shake tins, the number of people who go past by on the other side, and I think that we do have to be careful with the numbers, and even those people who normally give do get a bit fed up if there are too many. So what I thought was that it was quite important to look at all these organisations that do seem to me really to have nothing to do with Oxford or Oxfordshire, and that we should be very careful. Now, if we are going to, for instance, allow I mean there's one organisation, number five, which says it's a national, although it's called Cherwell Round Table, which says it's just a national body raising funds for numerous charities. Now, if we're going to allow an organisation like that, have we no erm chance to say that after they've had their collection, we should like to have some indication of what percentage went to Oxford, so that when they apply again, we can at least know whether this is actually a genuine local organisation or national. And a lot of these organisations, it's very difficult, because there are many that a lot of people are in favour of, like, well, take King George's Fund for Sailors and so on , but how do we know, I mean, there might be two people they might help in Oxford over the course of the year. I do think it's a difficult one, but I do feel there is a limit to the number, and therefore we should be careful that the ones we agree to are the ones that interest local people. Right. I think we certainly agree with you in terms of locality, and it's open to you at any time, I would have thought, to be in touch with Katherine, and say, ‘Would you follow up on x or y’. I think if the committee did that then we'd be back to what five or six years ago, when a whole afternoon was spent on that and I wouldn't commend that to you, but can we perhaps have a word with the officers at a later stage, take it on board what both Graham and Anne have been saying, and obviously not trying to do that in a meeting like this but try to prepare for it a month before-hand. Is that reasonable at this stage? Yes\\nso we can get progress? Chair, could I make, could I suggest maybe that in future when you ask organisations  you make it harder for getting a license for street collection, that you tell them that you'll want to know exactly the proportions, but I mean put it back on to them, rather than be you having to bother to it in the future. Right, is that not done? It is to a degree, on the application form that each charity receives, it has to state whether it collects for people in the Oxford area, but not as a percentage. I think that, more, not sort of say a general question like that, but say that after the collection has happened that you want returns for the number of people in Oxford that have benefited from the number of groups in Oxford that have benefited. I mean, I think a lot of national organisations that are giving, I trust that are giving money to people actually do want to know that sort of detail about where the money is going, because, if I go through this, I mean, I would have to say that I should imagine that a very small percentage of the money that has been collected on these flag days will actually get back into Oxfordshire. I mean, my knowledge of the organisations that are there tells me that. I mean there's organisations like Oxrad that clearly, the money will only be spent in Oxford city. And the bit about it is that there may well be other small organisations that might, erm be better, erm I mean, have, might benefit people more in Oxford city, or in Oxfordshire, aren't getting in because \\nNo, that's not the case, it's open to them to apply in any event. I know, but what I mean is that when they see the city centre, the people who are walking up and down the city centre, they see all the national charities, they don't necessarily feel that they're organised in the same way and therefore that they should be participating, and the whole palaver of getting a licence and applying is actually quite difficult, it's not a simple, it's not something, we get numerous telephone calls in the office saying ‘Well can I go out next Saturday and rattle a tin for such-and-such’, and you say ‘Well, you can't’, and it's left much too late, so that people don't know about the way you get licenses to rattle tins in city centre. Don't know about the issues to do with house-to-house collection. Are we getting, erm collecting erm in the shopping centres. They just don't actually have that information, a lot of small local groups, and I think maybe the C B S could work with the Engineers department in future years and try to get to those groups, because I'm sure a lot of them, actually if they were given the opportunity in time to get in, that, that you might have a lot of people applying for flag and whatever than you do now. Well, by all means, let's do that, and  has been represented in committee for some time, we have responsibility for licenses for some time, and if there isn't a dialogue now, then there'll be a good reason why there isn't, and I, I take what you say, Liz. But certainly, if we have something like fifty applications, then we'd be into a much more complex procedure. We can see why we don't, and I'm not clear about the reasons why we don't, but there you are, Michael. Chair, another query about a couple of the comments made just now, about priority being given to organisations which disclaim their proceeds in Oxford or Oxfordshire. I had a cheque for some thirteen hundred pounds raised by the local branch of National body, a body like Round Table, although it wasn't Round Table, it was another body like that, and that will buy thirteen houses in Everland in Southern India. Well, not a single penny will be spent in Oxford or Oxfordshire. Now, am I to take it that sort of appeal will have a very low priority, I mean, how about Oxfam for example? Oxfam doesn't have a low priority, clearly, erm there are, certainly we have an S.O fifty-three procedure for disasters and so forth. But there isn't a direct slot, Michael, you're right, for a project such as the one you've just described. I mean, maybe what I'm hearing from the committee is that we take it back and look at the criteria and the ground rules. I just would suggest that we don't do it in this committee. But what we certainly can do is take note of what you've said, and ensure that we get it together for you to be consulted before we take decisions next year. Graham, you've had two bites, and I really \\nI was only going to agree with you actually, and I was just going to back-up what Michael said, and say that obviously we've got people like Amnesty International, and I know it's a very hard-working local branch, but obviously, the money it's raised is going to benefit people overseas. Hopefully so, hopefully we haven't got people within the city of Oxford that need Amnesty's help! Right, can I leave you then to the recommendations on page sixteen, notwithstanding all of the suggestions and comments that have been made, that we this year grant twenty-one Saturday City Centre permits, and the officers are clear twenty-one and not twenty-three, that we grant eleven City Centre, mid-week and suburban permits, and do you note that whoever is unsuccessful in obtaining Saturday City Centre permit will be granted one of those and given priority. Yes? Will you agree to grant three band collection permits, which you've done before, which are usually great fun, I must say. And D is part of what Michael is saying, it gives the chair, vice-chair, opposition liaison member the discretion to allow for usually natural disasters, and we would obviously want that discretion with your support. There's one final thing, and that is on page fifteen at the bottom, it's a list of organisations which were given permits for St Michael the Northgate. And I'm not quite sure why Age Concern, which has had this for I think at least twenty years for their Christmas Carols, which is not included. But I don't, the fact that they're not included does not mean that they can't have it, because that would be disastrous, because they do rely on that \\nIt doesn't, they just haven't requested it this year. Well, I mean, that is absolutely nonsense, it's tradition, I'm sure they'll have it. Can you take that up with Age Concern, Anne? There's a limit as to how much we can do for half the people in this committee are members \\nBut you see it's inaccurate anyway, because it's five two during nineteen ninety  five, and they had it \\nThis year\\nThey did for last year. I mean, it's for Christmas this year that we want it. Well, can you get them together with Katherine fairly rapidly, is that a good idea? I mean, there's enabling and enabling, isn't there for heaven's sake. Chair, on the recommendations erm on item D, I'm a bit unhappy about the use of the term ‘natural’ disasters, because I believe that many of the disasters that people in Oxford are actually giving money for are man made disasters, particularly matters of international economics and the unfair burden, erm unfair distribution of wealth which places a whole sector of the world in poverty, and I think, you know, you do get a magnificent response from people in Oxford to these charities, and we must be aware that there are a whole number of greater issues involved, and while I hear what you're saying earlier on about you can't take on the problems of the whole world, I think when people are actually giving money to charities for example, like Oxfam, they are often unaware of these issues, and we do have a wider role in making the, joining with organisations like Oxfam in spreading public awareness on these issues. Right, I agree with that, and I think that we'll simply leave out the word ‘natural’ in future, won't we. Have we agreed that as a committee? Indeed, we have all agreed, I take it the recommendations under eight one in order that we can make progress. Which left the word in? So that we can report back, a month before decision time next time round? Are you happy with that? Item seven then is on page twenty-seven. This is flag day, which essentially means house-to-house. Is there anything you want to say about that, Katherine at this stage? No, it's quite straightforward. Right, the only comment I have is members will remember that we got slapped in council last year because we issued a permit to LIFE for a flag day application. I sat down with LIFE and worked through their philosophy, erm in line with our own as it were, and they agreed, and I would ask them to agree this year that any paperwork or any leaflets they distribute make it very clear that a choice remains for a woman in terms of whether or not she should have an abortion, because LIFE is fairly, yes, Michael? Did you check their tenancy agreement, because it was a pretty Machiavellian, Dickensian tenancy agreement, if you're found smoking in bed for example, you were out the next morning, those sort of things, and I think you really ought to look at that very carefully. We certainly did last year, there's no reason why we can't monitor it again, so they know we are watching them quite carefully. That might have been for very good environmental and health reasons. Yes, I should hope so. I think I would commend LIFE to you, but it will be with the same conditions and terms as we did last year, with which they did comply. Are there other questions of queries on flag days or are you happy to approve them as they stand. That's on page twenty-seven, six one, twenty four flag day permits to be approved, and we allow the officer to decide how they will best be distributed across the city. Are you happy with that? And then on six two, do you wish to grant a permit to allow a flag day to take place on one or two days during nineteen ninety-one, for the Royal British Legion? Can I have someone move something on that, please? Yes, I'd move that erm they'd be granted two days. I'll second that. And you'll second that, cross-party approach to this, are you all agreed? Thank you very much indeed. Can I ask, I know we've got Amanda Root here, who's going to help us in the Health Action Area Report, I also know that she has an ailing child, can we then take the item eleven, health action areas now on page fifty-eight, so that we can let Amanda go back to her commitments. The joint report from Amanda and Phil. Amanda, do you want to kick off on this? Thank you chair, erm many of you will perhaps know that the health authority did some pioneering work looking at different standard mortality ratios in different wards in Oxfordshire, and came up with some rather disturbing evidence that some of the wards had significantly higher incidents of death for people primarily in the forty-five to sixty-four age range than others, and Phil and myself wish to continue that work by targeting those wards with a range of measures designed to alleviate some of those health inequalities. And in this report, we've just outlined a very preliminary start to what we're doing. We'd obviously, we'd like to get the agreement of this committee to continue that work and to take it up to the various bodies  and consultation. And, erm to develop it there's a timetable in the appendices about the progress we envisage making. We'd like to confirm by the end of this year which wards we're targeting and how we're targeting them, which range of erm measures that we're going to undertake. is that we've been involved in health strategy for the past over five years. The ultimate test of any health in the city strategy is what we do about the health divide. We have to do something about the equity target. And that's extremely difficult to do something about the equity target, since National policy, the distribution of income, housing policy, all the things that we tackle on this committee and committees of the council have a very significant effect on the health of the people who live in the city, and it's not in our control. Nevertheless, it's our belief that through health promotion programmes which involve cooperation with communities themselves, that we can in fact do as much as we possibly can do to actually alleviate some of the erm differences in health status. So our belief is that erm with the relationship we've been able to build up in this city, with confrontation and community participation, with the targeting of the small resources that we do have, as a council in collaboration with the other, the resources of the other bodies, that we can in fact do something. So I'll do this and I think Amanda would agree with this that this is the ultimate test that will help us in establishing can we actually do something about target one of the World Health Organisation, which is to narrow the health divide. That's out test. I would also add to that that I think such work would help us in terms of targeting more effectively the existing resources we have in terms of service delivery. Are there any questions? Sheila? Chair, I'd like to ask Amanda, I did  St Clements and Petersfield . Is there any possibility of, in the near future of doing a council estate, like Barton or Blackbird Leys? erm Yes, certainly, I, I would suggest East and St Clements because they have got quite high ethnic populations, and we can perhaps be hoping to start there, because Environmental Health's already worked there, targeting some of the multi-occupation properties, so they've got a very high proportion of black people living there, which means that they're also quite important in the sense of deprivation, but, I mean, we are also very conscious that we should be working on a council estate, and what we, what I would like to do is to simultaneously be starting working in erm a particular sets of communities, is to be given work in consultation in other wards, so that you know, six months down the line before . But thanks for the point, and I mean, I'll make a note of that and take it up to the health authority. Betty and then Ruth. I'm a little surprised, chair, I could ask Amanda, but erm, Iffley is erm on the list, bearing in mind, recalling the erm point figures, where Iffley are if I recall correct was fairly well down on the league table, and Marston was something like erm six or some place. erm What connection is there between unemployment and deprivation? Thank you. erm I agree, and I actually think these figures are relatively crude, but I mean, there is, clearly there are correlations between low income, which most I mean unemployed people have of course got, and ill health. But certainly, something like Iffley's relatively surprising, it could well be, it might be because there's quite a high proportion of retired people or something, so the figures are actually distorted. erm What, what we're hoping is that erm the university's undertaking some research to actually look at the links between very small geographic areas, postcode in fact, and ill health. So when that research becomes available, we'll actually be able to be much, much more specific about where we're targeting, because I agree it's, you know, some of these are somewhat surprising. Nonnie\\nYes, in one five, erm they're practising notes from Eynsham it does happen to be in Cherwell ward and not North ward, erm there is a booklet out about health and housing in Cutteslowe, and I wondered what the connection between, you know, not being on this committee, but these health action areas, and what in fact is happening in housing, because the director did assure me that other wards were going to be treated to the same erm treatment. So I don't know whether that is what's referred to? Hang on, can I just check out your question, certainly we've taken the Cutteslowe health and housing audit to this committee, and so has housing \\nYes, yes, but that's not going to be the only one, as I understand it. That was an external one in fact \\nYes, is that's what's being referred to erm by the university work, because I think it's \\nIt isn't actually\\nIs that so? It isn't. The other question I've got is presumably all this is still being done within what we've got in the budget, or is it, are there going to be extra bids? You know the answer to that question, Non, there's going to be no extra bids. No extra bids. This particular section's taken some slices already, so we'd better watch what we say to them. They're doing it within their own time and resources, but it does seem to me to be a very appropriate area for  Michael? Thank you\\nIt's certainly will be difficult, Chair, but in answer to Mrs Tidley, what's happening to our housing, the answer is we've stopped building it. Government policy we don't build any housing, and therefore we've got five thousand on the waiting list, and that's why health is a major problem for a lot of people in this city, because we're not building any houses, she knows that, and she and her party do nothing about it. We're doing an awful lot in \\nThank you, Gerald. Yes, well, I particularly welcome this erm concentration on areas, I think it's an excellent idea, particularly in relation to housing, I think what we will find interesting is that a whole number of Oxford citizens, perhaps indeed from Barton, Blackbird Leys, Marston originally, who are badly housed in these areas and waiting in the most appalling accommodation for the opportunity of a council home. And I'm sure that this report on the health action area is going to show some fairly, erm give us some fairly staggering erm revelations about about the health of Oxford citizens that's going to surprise people at large when they find out how badly people have fared over the past ten years when we've had the Tories in office who've really done their very, very best to make the health divide of this country in a very poor state. Hear, hear\\nThank you, Anne\\nSorry I was going to go down to get an authorization from Age Concern, I missed the first bit, but erm if resources are allowed for this work, would it not be better to aim them at priority areas, and not wards, I mean, in other words, to put it to the areas that needed most. I mean a ward is going to be seen as rather a big area, when within wards there are priority areas. That was really my point. I don't think I'll bother to answer the remarks that others need to say of course tremendous resources have gone into the health service over the past few years, but I think whatever government is in power, it will never be enough for all the new developments in the health service, and that is always the trouble, whoever would be there would find it difficult. erm Your comment on wards, I think this is a way of the officers giving us something to work on and take a decision on. Once they have a decision to work, then I would doubt very much actually they're going to be into every corner of St Clements and East, or ignoring council estates altogether. We have to allow them to take some decisions within our decision, I think, but I'm sure they'll take your point anyway. Diana, and then we ought to come to a decision. Yes, I'm sure, I mean we obviously all appreciate the fact that within wards there's an area of deprivation and an area that isn't deprived. I mean, many, many wards, but that doesn't mean that we should therefore ignore a ward because it's got an area that is not deprived, you've got the, I think that by choosing East and St Clements as areas, that they seem then quite sensible areas to start with, nice central, fairly central location. I was going to say, when it comes to paragraph five, do you erm suggest that you actually think in terms of church organisations, they're not mentioned, and I look forward in in paragraph seven one to the seminar, the working seminar that's going to be in the near future, and I hope that we'll soon get a date, so that we can get it in our very busy diaries, in the hope that we can come along and learn more about this. Thanks very much, Diana. Could we add mosques as well to the churches, please? I'm sorry, I should have said all religious groups. All religious groups ! Can we come to a decision there please. Yes, just on the sub-ward level, of course there's really, there's a lot more investigations to go into targeting the resources, just I mean to target them in a city by having these standard mortality ratios for wards, but they're all below ward level, and target the specific areas. erm That's one point, the other point is of course, we have already targeted of course in working with the groups that we've defined as erm ones whose health status is at risk in effect, so this is a supplement, this is actually translating those targets we have already defined into a locality planning exercise. So we're testing, those priorities are still holding for us that but we're applying them to the localities. Thanks very much. Can I direct you then to page sixty-one, recommendations in paragraph eight. You're asked to support the general move, that we have set out from this report, and you're asked to agree to St Clements and East Ward, and I think we've heard Mandy and Phil acknowledge that there may well be a case for looking at an area of council housing, which we will leave them to do, and also to approve the set of objectives, which I particularly welcome, on page sixty-two and sixty-three, which will amount to a work programme, which I would have thought we were all very pleased to see. Can we endorse that, and ask the officers to come back to us and keep us in touch with their work. Are you agreed? Thanks very much indeed, thank you both, and I . We need to move somewhat quickly, and I am reminded that, I did see Caroline come in, but we have two people who've come in connection with item fifteen, Community Concerns in East Oxford, are you agreed that we take that now, so that they can \\nI think it ties in very well with the item we've just discussed. Thank you, Graham. Item fifteen, and Shereen has just arrived as well. Caroline and your visitor, would you like to join us at the table, if you want to join in. So we're turning to page seventy-five. The paper is in fact written by Shereen. I don't want you to think, Caroline that we are acquitting you rapidly, I will try to acquit you rapidly, but I am also delivering what you've come for. Well, thank you, chair, for inviting me here. erm do you want me to speak to this \\nPlease do. Caroline Morrell, from OCADU, do you want to press your button, Caroline, so that everybody will  please sit down normally and naturally, and maybe moved a bit closer to you, they'll pick up what you're saying. erm But I raised this at the alcohol forum, because erm sometime this summer I had a phone call from Mr Bailey here, who is a resident of East Oxford, to express his concern about various problems erm in East Oxford, problems that were posed to residents there. erm I think in fact it would be better to ask Mr Bailey to explain what his concerns were erm I'd just like to say first although initially it revolves around problems of drinking, I'm looking at other issues of East Oxford, in that recently there's been a great deal of concern about glue sniffing in sections there, and there have been various letters from residents in the local newspapers, and I think there's a general level of problem for people living in East Oxford, and it's not just that the people there want the streets cleaned up or whatever, they want something constructive and helpful to be done for people. So \\nWelcome, would you like to take two or three minutes to talk to us about your concerns.\",\n",
       " \"Right. I should say first how this matter arose. It arose because some neighbours in my street effectively started behaving which was totally antisocial. There was a small group of young people who, as it happens were also associated with the bed-and-breakfast on Iffley Road, erm and several of them had moved between this house and the bed-and-breakfast. Their activities ranged throughout the day and night and reached a peak of basically making a noise nuisance of themselves, there were other troubles which I will mention later, in which they would be playing two or three different sound systems, and at its worst, a full drum set in the early hours of the morning, obviously keeping their near neighbours not only awake but in a state of some anxiety. I live directly opposite to them, and there were two of their neighbours who effectively unable to carry on a normal life throughout most of the time that they were there. This was taking place on five or six nights until early mornings a week for several hours. Eventually a noise abatement notice was served on them, and erm immediately after that the landlord offered them a hundred pounds to leave, and they left. He did that because they had not only annoying his neighbours, sorry, their neighbours, because he had once been one of our neighbours, but also they had damaged his house, and they had already cost him probably about two hundred pounds in repair bills until the house itself, broken doors, window erm the wall, and bit of the roof and so on, and there was every reason to believe that this would just carry on. Now, erm I think I should make clear that I have some personal feelings on this, and I just want to say something very briefly about my neighbours, something I actually don't agree with . erm There is a general concern I think with multiple occupancy that there's, a whole way of life of East Oxford is changing, and not for the better, and indeed I was part of this when I moved into the area ten years ago. erm And the, a lot of this was not specific to drug or alcohol abuse but simply to multiple occupancy. And we've now reached a situation in which there's something over twenty percent of our streets is multiple occupation, erm and this is noise and other activities in relation to that are the things that cause the sort of low level of concern, and this was just the peak on top of that of major aggravation. erm I think there are one or two of the elderly tenants in particular who felt really very anxious about activities at night time, and they're going to have their property stolen, or things thrown at their house. I mean these people, there's things like throwing broken milk bottles, throwing milk bottles into peoples yards, removing bicycles, picking up my bicycle, as it happens, and throwing it down several times, erm going down the streets playing a sound system full volume at two o'clock in the morning, which generally left people feeling they didn't know what was happening. This was only part of a general sort of pattern as it were, where people were beginning to impinge on their lives, there was another well-known local alcoholic  there who was knocking on doors trying to get money off people, and there's several elderly people who gave this woman money, because they were frightened that if they didn't something would happen to them. So I think I can  express some of my neighbours concerns, unless, particularly, not particularly worried about those, but there is a general feeling that things are getting worse, and that they're not safe in their own homes, among the more elderly. erm And obviously a few people don't like the sight of people on the Cowley, the Cowley Hospital site, and things like that. This doesn't concern me. I do feel I'd like to say one point about the people who were in this house, that it's quite clear, all of them I believe were under care of the social services, erm and I don't know enough about their history to say whether they, where they've been before, whether they've been in some half-way house, or just been thrown out of some mental institution. I'm virtually certain that the woman from whom we had most of the aggravation had been. She was clearly mentally disturbed, and the reason that I got in touch with the legal project was to see if there's anything that could be done by them to start giving her some way of getting in touch, getting to solve her problem. Obviously this was done out of self interest, but I really, the woman was in real pain. She was an extremely angry, very bitter woman, who was determined to get everybody around her as angry as she could, and she succeeded, and I don't know where she's moved now, but I'm sure she will go on and do the same thing, and frankly, I despair of anything being done unless there is some provision made for people such as herself, and one of her friends in particular. That's really what I'd like to say. Thank you very much indeed, I think that's fairly fair, but none-the-less honest way of setting out your feelings. This is quite a specific issue, and I'm not sure that this committee on this day is in the best position to discuss it in detail. Obviously I'll take your advice on that. I do think as far as placing people in houses in multi-occupation, we acknowledge that. How is it done, by whom, who thinks about it, is it planned, is there support, and for that reason we are arranging a meeting, Frank, together with the Health Authority with all those agencies who do place people, sometimes quite sick people as you rightly point out. So that is certainly on line. Now, I know that what Shereen asks us to do, and I'm sure Caroline as well, is to organise a multi-agency meeting. We've done this on the proposed East Oxford Education centre. I think we can very usefully do this, and iron our way to this. What we need from you is really a specific proposal about the kinds of groups and individuals that you want us to sit down with. You can either do that now, or we can agree in principle that we will take this up. Perhaps chair, vice chair, and opposition liaison member if you feel that's suitable. And call such a meeting. I think it will a long way, but you're quite to draw it to us, and to ask us to set out on that road. Michael? Yes, chair. What sort of people would you involve in this meeting. I mean there's a lot of voluntary organisations who are working in this field, I don't know how you would just make sure you got them all. The resources are pitifully small. I mean, I'm involved in doing some statistics for Windmill House, the probation service, and we've found that the sixteen-to-eighteen-year-old provision in the city is very, very small. I'm sure it's the same for many of the other groups who've got problems. But, erm I hope you involve all those sort of organisations in your discussions. I would imagine that Shereen would apply the same kind of pattern as you did to the de-toxification centre meeting, Shereen, and I felt that there were a great many people there, a great many interested, including the voluntary interest. Betty? Well, of course, chair, a lot of these problems are arising out of the so-called ‘care in community’. I was hoping we'd avoid the political discussion, Betty.\",\n",
       " \"Well, you know, I mean. We've a job to do here. Well, you know me, I don't normally become political, but let's face it, this is one of the direct results of throwing the money to the community without any after care, and I was particularly concerned, with my other hat on, only last week, that a young man told us his address was now the night shelter. Now, because his time at the Bridge had ended, he had nowhere else to go, except to the Nightshelter. Now, I thought that was quite inappropriate for a young man like him, who had nowhere else to go, so there are many, many multiple problems for people like this in this city, and anything we can do would be appreciated, but I really don't know where we would stop, there are so many problems. I would ask members to be brief, otherwise we shall actually lose matters off this agenda today. Liz, and then Patrick. Chair, can I suggest that some of the people who are actually involved in this are actually asked themselves rather than agencies that might be working with them, because I think that, that most of the, the sort of people we're talking about are actually very sensitive. And they know about what's happening to them, and know that at the end of the day, it doesn't matter about what their behaviour is, it doesn't matter about what happens to them, because nobody cares. And I think it's very, very important that they're involved. Through the Princes' Trust in the month we actually give grants to something like twenty people, just to get them off the street, because there was nowhere else they could turn to. And I think that there's a massive problem that needs to be addressed, and I think we should involve those people themselves, also in looking at what the issues are, it's all very well for people to decide, workers to think that they know what the issues are.\",\n",
       " \"I very often think that that's not the case. Yes, I think we'd all agree with that. Patrick? Thanks, erm the report refers to East Oxford, which is of course for two wards, East and St Clement's, but the problem extends city-wide, and I think the solution should be seen as a city-wide solution. Yes. Do you want to finally come back? Yes, I'd like to add one point, matters that the house continues in multiple occupancy and is successful at the present, and the landlord is not prepared to say that he is being now an agent of some hospital or other. I'm sure that he is, the people who've come from there, quite clearly recovering alcoholics or mental hospital patients, or possibly people from prison, and I've known enough people in my time to know this. And it is working very, very successful at the moment with the current set of tenants. However, there's clearly a need for some sort of monitoring and for some support erm other than erm some other support. The landlord is not prepared to come up front and say that's what he's doing. Unfortunately, I suspect because he fears a reaction from his neighbours, and I'm afraid he's right. He'd be very aware of what's likely to happen. He is trying to do something about it, though, I'm sure. Right, and this will call for some sensitivity in terms of how we handle this. Caroline and Shereen, is there anything else you want to comment on, otherwise I would ask that you'd come back to me on this in more detail. I think I'd just like to add that I think that this could possibly be a very big piece of work. Exactly. And I think it would actually need, if it's going to be taken on board, somebody appointed to look at this, or it be put in somebody's job brief and I would have thought ideally that it would be placed with the community worker, and I don't know quite how we're placed for community workers in East Oxford, but maybe it's something we could put to that department. I hear what you say, and I hesitate to make any further comment on that, given the current climate, but let's set about just examining the shape of the difficulty at the moment, and see what we can as it were immediately deal with ourselves, and what we can try and persuade other people to help us to know . Will you come back to me in terms of who you want to invite, taking on Liz Kermey's point about involving people themselves if they so wish, and we'll consult with the opposition liaison member and the vice-chair. But in principle we agree do we not, to back multi-agency meeting, given what we said in the discussion and we will come back to you with something that's maybe a bit more specific, and more easy to discuss, may I say.\",\n",
       " \"Thank you very much indeed for coming. Thank you. Thank you, thank you for bringing it forward. Thank you very much. We're back to the normal agenda, item eight on page thirty-six. Will you also while you're looking at this look at page thirty-seven, which is the pollution and nuclear issues control sub-committee. You will see there there has been a detailed discussion on this white paper, and members from that sub-committee made comments. I would suggest we do not need a second read of the discussion, but that can people keep an eye on , or try and change what is already there on pollution itself. Peter, you're introducing this on page thirty-six. Yes, I think it's totally clear that what we need is a short message, and it's a white paper, and therefore it's inviting a message, so what we really need is a short message to go with the A B C and the government act on the two S P's and I would give an undertaking at this point that it will go under the chief environmental health officers' name. Yes, quite. While you're thinking about it, there are three quick things that you might like to add in, one is on page seventy-four, which, erm seventy-four? I think it's seventy-nine, Peter. Yes, seventy-nine, it's the, in particular one a, I think concerns this community greatly. The document included no indication of the role of local authorities, or the resources needed by local authorities. We intend to take this recommendation for action. And if you actually look at this paper, there's quite a bit at the end of the day that the local authority will need to do, and I think we need to underline that and to get money. The second point, briefly, is that the white paper has turned its face on the establishment of an environmental protection agency, and independent environment protection agency, and erm, you may feel strongly, I know there was another report that came out just about that time that erm was advocating it, and you may feel that what is needed is a central, independent environmental protection agency. This paper only gives erm an, what is called an integrated pollution inspectorate, now unfortunately with those sort of central inspectorates is that after the public's attention has drifted on, they tend to be erm, they tend to dwindle in numbers, as we've seen with the present pollution inspectorate. Now, thirdly, is on this question of C O 2 emission. If you look at the report, White Paper, you'll notice that it's sticking to a, a freezing of the nineteen-ninety levels by the year two thousand and five, and you may feel that you would like to see this country come more into line with the other E E C countries and ask for a freezing by the year two thousand. So those are three, anyway, three things erm that you might like to think about for a short message for a response to the White Paper. Michael. And can I ask members not to repeat the discussion of the pollution sub. Just be very brief, chair, erm could I ask that we have a report before council on this, and I know it will be an extra two hours on the poor council debate, but I think this is so important, and it does affect the planet for hundreds of years to come, and I think if we can't have a discussion on this in full council, well, it's the most important thing we've had for years probably, and I think we should have a discussion before council sit. Can I ask for a list of the full report before council, so it will give us a chance to have a debate there rather than here. You can, and we will. Anne? It was just on a minute on page seventy-nine, I think we want to get the support of local M Ps, one a has I think, has been just indicated, is contradictory, it might be better to say, ‘although the document indicated that local authorities would be expected to undertake extra, an extra, or extra duties, the resources needed are, no indication was given of how there would be extra resources, or something like that, you see it's contradictory at the moment, it says there's no indication of the role, and then says that they would need resources, and actually if you look through the document, you will see from time-to-time it is indicated what local authorities are expected to do, for instance recycling of litter and the lot, and I think that that might be actually picked up by M P's and say, ‘Well, what actually have you, do you mean to say’, well, what we're really saying, are we not, that here is an indication of things that we're expected to do, but as usual, of course , the government hasn't indicated what erm where the resources were coming from. Kate? Sorry, chair, would you wish, when we consider this, do you wish to make the amendment? Well, you won't be able to do that until we do consider the, I mean, but, the reason I referred to page seventy-nine, is to ensure that we do not repeat ourselves, and that those of us on the sub-committee, remember what we said then, and decide whether we want to repeat that. I mean, on the items of wording, I mean, that can be done on two sub-committees. Yes, fine, I just asked, just checking. Are there items that people, I mean, I take the point about freezing C O 2 emissions. That's woolly to say the least. We may want to make the point that if we are to be committed to doing something about the global warming of the ozone layer then we will need to say when we will do it by. And ensure there's a programme which achieves that. Are there any other additions to that, if not  Patrick. Yes, I'd like to support Michael in the setting up of an environmental protection agency. I think that if we leave it to \\nI don't think it was Michael who suggested it.\",\n",
       " \"No, I didn't. Well!\",\n",
       " \"It was Peter. Oh, yes, Peter, sorry. I think it would skip to environment being the prerogative of local authorities, there will be a great variation across the country, and I don't think anybody seriously would expect that to happen about health and safety at work, and I think the same should be true of the environment. Right, just to move us on, then, since you're all going to have a go at this at council, yes? Sorry, I just wanted to refer to page eighty-one, erm sixth form conference, thirty-three. Yes\\nerm Students will be asked to report back to the next erm sub-committee\\nYes they will\\nSo, shall we have a full report then to the next environment and health protection sub-committee of that report. Yes. Can I just bring you back to the item before us, which is ‘This Common Inheritance’, and ask you to endorse the sub-committees suggestions, i.e. repeat them, as comments from the health committee, with the additions from the vice-chair on environmental protection agency. on point more adequately made by the deputy about C O two emission, are there any other comments that people want to make, or are you agreed that we refer back to council as it is? Are we then taking up the point that Liz Spokes made on item one a, on page seven. Procedurally Nonnie we can't do that till we come to the sub committee. Well, so that is how it's going to council. I think it's a great pity. Clearly that will not be the case that that's how it goes to council. But procedurally, we can amend it when we get to the sub-committee. Is the sub-committee then going to meet before council. No, we have not yet taken the minutes for this sub-committee, I have simply asked you to take it together with this agenda item. All I was going to say was that clearly I agree with one thing, but one would assume that as the paper is a really a general outline that we would be seeing specific targets as the agenda's worked through over the next two three years. Oh, yes, if the government's still there, I'm sure they'll do that, yes. Thank you Graham. Well, I think they'll be a government still there! No, yours. Labour! Can I then move you on, and we will correct the pollution and control sub committee minutes when we get to them just  and Nonnie. Item nine, there's a report for the half year ending on page forty-one, Tony? Yes, chair, erm, I was supposed to give the figures if they'd come out at this time. You'll notice one or two minor changes. You'll notice that instead of complaints signed in what would be technically the paragraph where they talk about service requests, because many of the requests we get from members of the public to provide a service are not necessarily complaints, but they do need our help. You'll see that both the number of requests for service, and the number of visits made are well up on previous half years, and although some of that is due to probably the highest figure on insect complaints we've ever had for six months, and erm it's not all that, much of it is lately the department has been very, very busy indeed. On food control, the level of food hygiene inspections at seven hundred and thirty we've achieved by buying in consultants to do some work for us in our priority area, and we're were able to do that with Derek Welk's retirement, leaving us with some unspent staff , and so we've achieved a higher figure there than we expected we would do. erm My cause for concern, and I think it's one that's been echoed in a number of places, is the still very high figure for food-poisoning outbreaks, for food-poisoning cases, erm you'll see we're not as high as the previous comparable half-year of last year, which was ninety-two, but that included the Keble outbreak, which you're well aware of, but at thirty-two for Oxford for a half year, that's a very high figure. We haven't had that sort of figure very often before. erm The national figure seems to be, the national figure of food poisoning cases this year looks like being in excess of sixty thousand. erm it was around fifty-four thousand last year, and the figure's just going up and up. The answer to it I just don't know, but the Food Safety Act deals with some of the future, some of the future objectives in terms of better training for people who handle food, and tighter controls on food businesses, so it's something to look forward to, and hopefully in years to come the figure will begin to drop. On erm food and noise, we're still very, very busy indeed, and our figure for noise inspection is higher than it ever has been before, and the comment that was made under that section will show you that some of that most certainly is the amount of work that the  team had to carry out during the summer, one of the benefits of our glorious summer is that most of us slept with our windows fully open for three months or more and one of the dis-benefits was that if anybody else down the road had a party that went beyond normal bed-time, everybody shared that, and our  team was very busy in consequence. erm On occupational health, and I don't plead for those figures, because for a time, until Helen left to have her baby, we were fully staffed, and the number of inspections and the number of notices served and the number of prohibition notices served are very encouraging indeed. The impact of the section has been very broadly based in the city, and for the first time we've added for you in very brief terms, a Domiciliary Health information of just the total number of visits made by the city health care, erm and the level of work in terms of notices served, and prosecutions, note, going up in most of the sections, particularly their units they're small numbers, but they are significant, just the same, and the table on the top of page forty-four, erm as I said earlier, I think we reached the highest level of insect complaints in the summer that we've ever had to deal with, it's very usual for us to deal with a thousand, over in the summer period, this time we dealt with sixteen hundred. An amazing amount of work carried out by the three members of the pest control team, with some additional help with larger jobs during the summer period. Thank you, Tony. I'd remind members that this report also goes to council. It's very useful if you have detailed questions on this particular report that you do let myself and the chief know well in advance, so that you get a detailed answer, quite frankly. erm I've seen Graham, Anne and Diane. Yes, erm very, very quickly, erm I notice that the swimming pool and river bathing visits had more than doubled, I just wondered what the cause of that was, and whether in fact it was mainly related to the swimming pools or to the river bathing bit erm places, and the second one is, regarding the noise, I notice that it has shot up, the number of visits to seven twenty one, but in fact, the prosecution's only gone up to one, and I wondered if Mr Fenn could tell us whether in fact because of the higher profile that had been given to this erm activity, due to its possible cut, whether in fact more people are aware of it and there were more\\nUndoubtedly\\nshould we say, complaints of a casual nature, rather than a particularly serious nature? Well,. erm On the question of the river samples and pool samples, yes, I think one of the city pools, one of the school pools we had a bit of a problem, so that took much of concentrated attention of it for a period of two or three weeks, so that's probably a reflection, I don't think much of it relates to the river sample. We take samples throughout the year from the river, but they're really at background level, and not very helpful I must admit, in terms of getting the quality of the river improved, we can't do that. On the noise question, yes, undoubtedly the increased erm number of complaints is partly due to the higher profile that was achieved during the summer, but erm no, I don't think that the complaints were frivolous, they were complaints that were, that needed attention, and there will be one or two prosecutions following through. Remember this set of figures closes on thirtieth of September. Very often prosecutions follow on sometime after the event happens. It may be worth saying, Tony that Graham's already talked to officers and it's worth your while talking to people on the house-to-house duty rota. Parties then with noise, just imagine going up to the door where there are fifty or sixty seething people in there. In order to serve a notice you have to get a name, and that's enormously difficult, because I mean, practical difficulties need to be taken on board, Anne and then Diana. Well, having had to avail ourselves of the help of the officer who got rid of our gigantic wasp nest, I should like to say what a superb job they do, but I just wondered in view of the tremendous number, whether there is some kind of way of preventions. I know in our case, and therefore probably in a lot that it isn't always possible, they'll always find a way in, but if there was some perhaps advice to people it might bring down this number of complaints, that you could perhaps do before the wasp season begins, I don't know whether that's a possibility or not. I don't think it's possible, chair, but I will talk with Clive Williams who's our expert in that. I think the main reason for so many wasps this year is to, warm summers, and but it's basically the long summer period, because we started, you see on the wasp complaints in May, which we don't really start until half way through June, and we kept going right through, right until the middle of October, and they normally stop round the end of August, so that's the main reason; a very long, hot summer. Thanks. I'd like to second Anne's congratulations really, to the, to the men who deal with wasps nest, because they're very usually men who come along! They are all men. They are? Well, I know he was a man, I saw him! All of them are. And, I certainly have taken steps to make sure that I don't get a wasps nest, but in that particular area again, because he begged to point out to me where the wasp was getting access to, a little tiny space above my bedroom window, and that has now been sealed, so hopefully the wasps another year will find a home somewhere else that isn't quite so close to my open bedroom window. So perhaps if people were aware of some of the places where wasps can go within their home, they might be able to sort of take those conscious  That wasn't actually what I had  \\nWell, be quick then! Nothing, nothing fascinating. I just wanted to know what on page forty-two under ‘Water sampling’, what the bracketing figures say four u stroke s, one u stroke s, etcetera meant, and on page forty-three, why under ‘programme and revisiting inspection’ this four one nine p was starred. I just wondered what those contexts  and you will be bound to be asked it in council if it's not asked now.\",\n",
       " \"Thank you very much, Diana. Thank you. Chair, we do class as unsatisfactory those samples that the laboratory would covers don't reach certain standards, whatever the standard may be, and that's why we concentrate on that figure that the bathing  unsatisfactory at one particular pool, where there was a serious problem.\",\n",
       " \"And the starred items, I think the starred items, I'm not sure now, I think, can you help here? No, I'm sorry, Ken. I'm pretty sure that the \\nProgrammed visits? Programmed visits, yes, I think they'll have been debt inspections that have carried out, whereas the higher figures above them are audit, and these are the ones that take more time, and are programmed to deal with everything, you know. May I suggest, may I suggest that's put on the report before it goes to council. Thank you, Nonnie finally \\nYes, erm on page forty-one, ‘unsatisfactory samples’, we have six others, erm is there a general category below six, like meat or something like that? If there was a general category, I think it would be put, however. Yes. The category ‘others’, under ‘unsatisfactory samples of food’ six. Yes, they could be a range of things, chair, I'll check out what they are and make sure you've got some \\nOkay, Nonnie. Yes. The only other thing I would say is that you've got domiciliary health there on the bottom of page forty-three for the first time, a thing that we certainly asked for on your behalf. I suggest that the figures you've got before you are not terribly, terribly useful, and that you do invite domiciliary health to come back to you for three months to talk to you about their work in terms of the visits, the visits that they do. It will be a whole lot clearer to you then, but it's there basically because it was asked for, it's inadequate because that was all they could do on the day, having been instructed to provide it. So I apologize for that. Could I ask, Chairman, chair the number of successful prosecutions? You've got it later on in the agenda, Arthur, can we wait for that one? And the report for the half year will go to the council as you've heard. Item ten, Matthew's been patient, where is he, he's there. Food control in Oxford on page forty-five. Can I ask you before inviting you to speak to us in two or three minutes on this, say that the recommendation, in a sense I think it has been overtaken, in that there is now under fifteen a the very distinct possibility of a transfer of a very technical post from the pollution section by the end of the year. That's to say someone is leaving and we are going to take that post out and put it into the food section, and on b, I would say to Matthew that before committing us to a budget of two and a half thousand against a background of ten percent cuts, I would suggest that the health educational help-line and their day-long courses for E H Os might be made good use of in the forth-coming year. But \\nThank you chair. I think first of all, I'd like to be very brief, but just to say the purpose of this short report with the appendices has not got any special status with food control, just set the record straight as to what we are capable of doing currently and what we can't do. erm That was with the current staff resources with certain changes since the summer. Now, it's obviously very good that a position is going to be replaced by a technician, for which a, which at the moment is elsewhere in the department. What erm my view is that we have a current shortfall, and I think the figures highlight this, and the shortfall is in the highest of the high risk, if you like, the ultra high-risk area of catering. erm Although one would hate to be, I don't want to be accused of being elitist and saying that E H O's must do a particular job, but what I would like to say it that we need people who are trained to a sufficient level to be able to do the ultra high risk catering area, as distinct from other high-risk areas. It's my professional opinion that we have a problem there in terms of training and expertise, and I feel that, as you've said, the technician is forth-coming, we will be obviously having to draft very, very carefully a job description, but I feel that training requirements will be such that it will be very, very difficult to fulfil those requirements and indeed to cope with this ultra high-risk catering area. It's my considered opinion that the only way we can do that is by an E H O, and we will find, eventually, that we will suffer continued short-fall in terms of ultra high-risk inspection. I think it's fair to say that we've gone a long, long way in Oxford to breaking down barriers with regard to the inspection priorities, and we are in a position within the city where we have  nature of, if you like, technicians and staff that are doing jobs that in many other surrounding areas, and indeed throughout the country are the prerogative of E H O, and these include areas specified as high-risk by MAFF, and include a great bulk of all customer and consumer complaints. The only area that I'm saying is in need for careful consideration is that related to risks associated with the possibilities of food poisoning and very high-risk food handling. I think really that is all I can say, chair, erm in addition to your comments. Thanks very much indeed for your report, Matthew, it's certainly very informative, and in an ideal world, I think we might have made a different decision today. Are there comments or questions immediately, Catherine? I do have a question and, and it hasn't made, that hasn't made it particularly clear as to where we are, you hinted that, and I think that was also seconded here that there might now be a post of some kind to carry on for instance the thing that I'm particularly worried about is that there's a sort of hiatus in the heartbeat awards, which I think would be a tragedy if that happened, and I want to be absolutely sure that that is, isn't so. Do I take it that actually the remarks that have just been made are really in favour of having a third E H O, but that in fact that that in circumstances, will not be possible. So I really, what I'm asking, is that perhaps it could be set out exactly now what stage we have reached, and what the recommendation is as from today. What you have before you is Matthew feeling and indeed, I would take it, supported by the chief officer. erm There always has been the situation since Derek Roberts retired, and in fact his post was put in the pollution section, where there was only one E H O, the agreement then that there would be a swap straight E H O for technician swap, but food had traditionally, as long as I've been involved have three E H Os. Now, I don't expect Matthew to support that for one moment, but what I'm saying to committee is that is our pragmatic solution at this moment. I don't expect the heartbeat award scheme to suffer, I will be in touch with Matthew fairly closely to ensure that, but I think the position of the labour group is that we cannot support these recommendations as they are but we offer you a compromise solution. Nonnie? Yes, erm, presumably the training for a technical post in the pollution section will give kind of basic bacteriology, which will be, you know, essential for going over into the food section, erm I mean, what will become. I think that's probably not the case, it isn't a person we're transferring over, it's a bit better than that, it's a post, which means that Matthew can advertise with a particular emphasis on food background. He may be right, he may not be able to recruit the ideal person. On the other hand there are some qualifications that technicians may take, we may be lucky, we may get such a person, and I hope so.\",\n",
       " \"Yes, so it isn't a person. Right. Matthew, are there, erm Diana? Thank you. It's a, it's a fascinating report and having been involved in the Food Forum discussion, when we, it was reported to us that we'd actually lost a community nutritionist, I read this with great interest to see just how now the professional was seen through sections. And, I mean, reluctantly we have to accept that this is not an ideal world, but I mean, just now, we were actually looking at the number of food hygiene inspections that have been done over the last few months, which have increased enormously, it just means, I mean it emphasises the fact that food has changed, food, and the number of places that are actually serving food now I mean, the corner shop does sandwiches. Everybody seems to be producing food, wherever you go food is on offer, food is for sale. I realise that many of these are not high-risk areas, but they are areas that our officers have got to, got to keep an eye on. And numbers are increasing while our staffing has actually, actually decreased. erm We've got to recognise the professional advice that Matthew is giving us in this report, that he, he needs professional trained staff, and it grieves me that really we can only offer a technician when he is asking for something more. But we are giving, we are giving him a post, another body, and hopefully with a very careful job description he will get a trained person, because we also recognise the fact that Oxford's a marvellous place for people to come. The environmental health department is seen throughout Britain as being a nice place to come. I mean, I keep hearing that when I come into the environmental health department, that, just that people are interested in what Oxford are doing. They keep  busy, don't they.\",\n",
       " \"Well set up. Yes. So we're one of the important environmental health departments, sure, so hopefully we will actually get somebody who is really very good, a food technician to assist in this erm field, and there have, I hope that through Food Forum we may well be able to help Matthew with his, well not just Matthew, but help, help that section with the nutrition advice that he feels is still lacking in his team under the circumstances. Thanks very much Diana. Can I just remind members that, I mean there's a member of the technical staff in this room now. We have a number of technicians in the environmental health department who do some sterling work, and I know that no one here would want you to suppose that they are a kind of second-string person. They do a different kind of work, they've traditionally done considerably responsible work within Oxford City's Environmental Health Department, so there isn't a suggestion on the part of any of us that they are somehow lesser beings, because that is not the case at all. Can I put it to you that we cannot today accept the recommendation on page forty-eight. But I do move today that we transfer the technical post that will become vacant in the pollution section by the end of this year to the food section, and that Matthew together with the chief environmental health officer consider how best to write a job description, and advertise for that post, and that while I do not see us securing a budget of two thousand five hundred pounds as under fifteen b, I do recommend that the health education authority are contacted, that their help-line is used, and that our E H O's use their premises in the coming new year. I am assured that they are advertised in the Institutions Journal. Matthew, that isn't all you want, but maybe we'll be able to discuss this again in twelve months time.\",\n",
       " \"Thank you very much for the work you've put in. Alright. Thank you chair. Thanks. I note that we have Terry Randal here. Maybe we should take item seventeen and allow him, is ten minutes going to be enough? erm I'll try and do this in ten minutes. You'll try and do this in ten minutes. Let's straight into seventeen then, I'll just remind committee that we need to move to the confidential section at five o'clock today in order to get it finished. Item seventeen is the age-well project, the report is circulated on page a hundred and eight. We're particularly delighted actually that Tony Randall has come along to share his own very particular views on this project. You'll remember that we had a pilot project in South Oxford Health Centre, Tony is one of the G P's there, I'm expecting that he's going to be very positive about this project since we all are, in terms of it's practice service delivery. Well, then Tony, tell us about how it feels at your end. Okay, I'll give you a very brief background to the project. It started in the Autumn of eighty-eight, when Phil approached me and said, ‘Look, we would like to consider putting our services that we do offer to finance in a more effective way’, running alongside that was a project being run by Oxfordshire Health Authority where they were sending postal surveys to elderly people; people over the age of seventy erm sixty-five at one point, and were getting back a huge amount of information on their perceived needs. We thought perhaps we can use that as a goal standard, and pick up what actually happens with our project to compare the two. So that's where we were in the autumn of eighty-eight. By spring of eighty-nine, when the project had started, we'd gone quite a long way down the road, we'd decided that we wanted to be looking at what was feasible in general practice. Get this machine working over here. What was feasible general practice, and whether that was the best place to be contacting the local people. Now, the reason we particularly were interested in this was that from the questionnaire we already were beginning to get back some information, and we discovered that eighty-six percent of people had seen their G P in the previous year, and maybe if we could introduce them to the age-well project at some point during that contact, we would be able to achieve something. Against that there'll be seventeen percent of this population was seeing home-helps, five percent was seeing social workers. So we though that we would try it in general practice. Next thing to do was to set up a form. Looks horrendous, but bear in mind these elderly people have just answered a sixteen page postal questionnaire with no help. And what's more eighty-six percent of them answered it. And I was quite impressed by that. We gave them a sheet of paper which said what we were, what we're doing, and said please, if you want any help in any of those areas, just tick the box, and if you don't want any help, tick this little box, and that's what they had to fill in. And they were given this when they were brought into the surgery by the receptionist. We discovered very rapidly that if it was the doctor that had to present the age-well project to the patients that quite often they forgot to do it. In greater detail I could look at what kind of coverage we've got, but I think in ten minutes I don't have time to do that. Suffice it to say that amongst the people who were not contacted by this project within the first year are some of those seeing doctors on eight occasions. The receptionists are much at giving out these things than doctors. They can do it while they're waiting, couldn't they. On the back of the form, we simply have a method of writing down anything that's interested, and also includes a sticker of who the person is, a particular one. So I thought we could look at results now, which are probably the thing that's most interesting. Just taking that form with those boxes, that's how people responded. This thing breaks it down by age, as I say, we're looking at seventy-fives and over. More than half the people don't want any help at all. Well, I think that's, we can accept the point easily. erm Quite a lot of help required in areas of the remit of this committee I would guess, things like home, security and safety, heating down here, quite a lot of people want help with heating. No, no, I agree. Are you laughing \\nWhy don't you \\nat my feet? Mm. I think you should wear those at appointments. No, my clients get a big enough giggle as it is. I don't think\\nby your slippers.

Describing the feature is only describing the feature. Mhm. Before means, nine, means your getting it there before nine you said and er, that means it's there nice and early.

If you build it in by design, like we build this in\\nand the design  of that was so that it will stay on, built in by design. And should stay on. Which means that  what did we say yesterday? Right. And therefore helps with your presentation simply. That's the benefit. Right. So, the fact that it's guaranteed that, we've actually built that in by design which makes it a feature. Mm mm. What he, what the customer gets out of that is what? So\\nWell, on, on the ten, ten thirty one \\nYeah. I've put it very similar to that of the nine o'clock one  really. Which it , it is. It's still \\nYeah I've I \\nthe elements of time really, yeah? That's it. It's just cos I , I couldn't do a lot more about that one. What other things , what other things other than giving them actually \\nCheaper. They're paying less \\nWell it's , it's an option \\nand they might \\nas well isn't it? They got an option. sometimes get it before \\nNine. nine. Yeah. It gives them, what does, what does options give you? A choice. A choice. It's choice, and I feel I'm, I'm able to choose  what does that make me feel? Good. In charge. In charge. Can I use the word control now then? Yeah? You're saying in charge is sort of like, I am in charge which is like this. It is if you make the customer feel they are literally \\nThat's right. Yeah. in charge of their \\nNow \\nservice. They like that. I like to know what's happening. Yeah. Adrian \\nYeah. said look Ka Kath, gotta get to Plymouth tonight, I need to know. Cos you, here he needs to know as well, don't you? You sit here today knowing that something's gonna be done. Because it couldn't wait until lunchtime and that, that's perfectly understandable because he wants to feel in control of what's going to happen to some degree, rather than just be at the mercy of someone else's position. He wants to be part, you know, influence that decision, and that's important to all of us isn't it? To know where we stand. You know people say, I like to know where we stand. I like to know whe , know where I stand. People love the feeling of being in control. And the before nine guarantees, just give them the time factor again. Er, that enables that they choose how much time they need, er because it, do I need to go that time or that time? And that gives them control. And as you say  it's one of the best things that they want. Because, when you subcontract it out, has anybody changed hairdressers? Or changed banks? Use a service where they've changed before now? Mm. Was there an element of risk involved? Were you a bit concerned at the time making the decision? Worrying about what might happen? And everybo , when you contract out something, when you ask someone else to do something for you. Ooh oh! There's just that  doubt. Obviously, repeat experiences, good ones, gives you peace of mind. But what I'm saying is, it's this that you really want. And becau , that's one of the most valuable benefits you can give a customer  time and control. Any more? Yeah the er, the noon one. Mhm. You're fo , guaranteed \\nOh yeah. before noon. Oh sorry. The noon, yeah. Again, we come into  which means that  what? Well it's, I put down on here that er, it's a benefit for customers that possibly their shops close half day where they can have collections, er sorry deliveries in the morning  so that they've got benefit of having deliveries A M \\nRight.\",\n",
       " \"only. Well done. Again, we're back to  being involved \\nChoice, yeah. and choice. Well done. Yeah.

So that the \\nReally , you're giving them time and control and it's up to you, it's an alternative choice on the whole thing. I dunno whether a price would be a feature or a benefit. I mean it's gotta be \\nI think \\na benefit\\nYes. to them. Be , yes certainly. But obviously people always receives the choice doesn't it? If, well it's a value judgement they make isn't it? But I don't think selling price saving is a, I don't think putting money up front first is a good idea. No. Because if you put it up front first, what do we now discuss everything around? Money. Money. That's right , yeah. D'ya see what I mean? That dictates. That's right. What I'm saying is, you always assume that that is people's  er albeit, which it is obviously isn't it?

       " \"Last thing innit, really? Yeah. Because when he makes out  mu ,bi how much is this worth? Is what, is where the money thing is coming in  not, how much he saves on the level of service.

Are there special taxis?\",\n",

Do their shopping  with a taxi . Because for some people  there may be a value judgement made about it. I don't know.

To be honest it's really difficult to put a cost to that. Hundreds or thousands. Er, thousands. Thousands. I mean we're talking big numbers an hour aren't we really? Yeah.

Now how they're gonna send them I don't know, but I can assure you they will send them in a hurry. Cos they were probably putting buttons on, or doing the last stitching \\nLast night. last night. That's it. Mm. Now it isn't,th the value it doesn't matter there. What they're doing is they're sending it so that somebody will place orders. And they could find themselves with, you know, somebody asking for a thousand of an item  and it's well worth their while therefore, spending a bit of money getting it there. That was Adrian's, also, that was Adrian's point. Exactly Adrian. Yep. And this is when you've been on the receiving end of it. Now, some of us haven't. I've never worked where I've had to get materials together and  you know, sort things out. I've worked in advertising. You see it in the crisp industry, they're all\\nYes. they're all\\nwell\\nNo salted crisps. We were \\nwell to be fair, first i \\nTimes I got that in. ha , how can I say, what,whe when you're talking about fa , I mean fast moving consumer good are fast \\nMm. moving off the shelves and into the shop and, what we would do was erm  deli people now do er, stock an order by computer and, and people like Sainsburys were doing that in the seventies, you know, and they would actually work over  er work on erm  data erm, from their computer  and order er erm  you know, okay, they'd be an event at the weekend or something and they'd, they'd of, increase it or something, but they would technically work out exactly what the throughput of certain items were. And it goes through the till now doesn't it? Yeah. Well, yes, they have a comput \\nyes they have the computer software. In my, in my day probably someone did it a little bit off that, different \\nMaybe. but the, but the proce , the, er the, the whole thing works on the same principal but now they're doing it without, with less effort. Now what I'm saying is, is the retail trade or the sharp end of th , you know,i it's, it's very much, it's staying alive. If you over stock, you're dead! You know I mentioned \\nYes. the manufacturing point, from that end, not from the end- user to get the products, to, to the retail \\nYeah. outlets, I meant that  \\nYe , you're probably right. But I mean to be fair we used to we, warehouse  thousands of tons of potatoes in Leicestershire, you see what I mean? We've made \\nYeah. we make er, you know you feel, ah my factory we thinks looking at \\nLike a . see looked at, looking, looking, look how we treat our potato, aren't they gorgeous! You know, and tha , we wouldn't go and have a look at a parcel machine system we'd look at lovely potatoes,. And Marks and Spencers use the same  potato. Can you just get your girls to wear their hats on each layer and we'll have your potato,the , you know, that's how you used to get the Marks, get their Marks and Spencers account. A , but what I'm sa ,wha the point you were making Adrian, is tha , is is  that's what you've gotta keep in mind about every time you walk into a business or phone up a business, that it does matter that it's in, your, that's not what we want  cos I'm telling you, you know, don't you know, the security guys  photographing, you know, lampposts and stuff like that. But if it's a bolt that holds a lamppost down and they've under  under-ordered, there's not, but they're with them, then we can take those. The other thing is, is docu , documents are the same. If, there are, there are industry working to deadlines all the time. I in  Terry was just mentioning his wife's business, in advertising, d'ya, would sell the advertising space in your feature or your magazine or whatever  try and get the bleeders to send you that what they wanna put in it!

What I'm saying is, that's why they respond in that way, which, in in other industries and comp , businesses, er, we have different er, things to consider don't we? Like arranging where they're bought and so on. Now T N T do something, when d'ya want it? We'll get it there. We'll get it there. Because, I mean, if we can't do it through T N T overnight i , if tomorrow's too late who do we use? And if they say well, we want erm  seventy five different locations served with crisps stands by ten o'clock tomorrow because our advert is going out  on national T V tomorrow  can we do it? Yeah. And we then go and recruit, we'll go the, you know, we'll go to the job centres and get them. Mm. Or, they'll turn round, if the money's, if the money is big enough, they'll turn round to anybody who works for us and say, d'ya wanna join us? Come and join us. Get your kit on and do a bit, d'ya know what I mean? And they'll just ask people to partake and we'll get it done. If it's, if it's, feasible we'll get it done. And that's the sort of ethos that T N T's got. But we're likely to make more money at it than  perhaps the sweat shops do. So what I'm saying is, is lead time in lots of business is highly valuable  but  if you can cut down the delivery time and give them more lead time  you're actually extending \\nYeah. the lead time by tightening up and this is where your time deliveries come in. Because, although it's before nine  erm, the next morning  erm  you're actually giving them now more lead time, you've given them another day because an , sometime tomorrow  you know, if it gets there at two o'clock and it's off-loading in in in at the bay and someone checks that it's been received and then someone makes a phone call to tell them it's there, and then they're doing something else, and then they come down and have a look at it, how many boxes do you think are sitting on loading bays that don't get looked at for a day or two, or three, or four, five  when they've had a next day service?\",\n",

Look at that place in Southampton, can do me a disc drive for two hundred quid or whatever it was, I don't know why but I can't remember the price, but let's keep it at two hundred pound, And he phoned them up and said oh your price is very good on that one.\",\n",

Sorry it wasn't thirty days, ten days to get here. What service does he need Carly? I can deliver to you next day, but it takes him ten days to get it here, what service does he need? Mm? Before nine. Before nine. Mm. Say it again louder. Carriage forward. Carriage forward. It's called carriage \\nCan you \\nforward. co can you explain to those who don't know what it is cos it's \\nYeah. a, it's a stupid name isn't it? Carriage forward. Sounds like the, talk about the horse before the ca , the cart before the horse. In the first place you've got three companies, A B and C  C's your manufacturer\\nD'ya wanna draw, do you want to draw it on here? Yeah, wait a minute. You got three companies  A, B and C.\\nErm  we'll call B the carrier  sort of like the go between if you like  A, is your say, shop  and C is your manufacturer. Now you may have a customer that comes into the shop  at A and they need something desperately, they walk in the sho , may walk in and say look I need that compact disc player, my life depends on having compact disc player and shopkeeper  no see now we haven't got it. But what they can do in this case is  the manufacturer's at C, but the manufacturer cannot deliver to the shop until  maybe two weeks time  they can phone us, the carrier, we will then arrange  for someone to go to manufacturer at C, pick it up, bring it to us and then we'll take to the shop.\",\n",
       " \"Right. All for a charge of course. Right. So that gives what, to the shopkeeper? Control. Control again. Now what else we could do, well said \\nCustomer satisfaction. that's, that's  that's well said, but we can also do third party \\nThird party. carriage forward \\nOh yeah. that's why, that's so that we can give the shop his control of supply  which actually like my da , you're saying if it was a computer disc supplier he could have next day delivery to him and then next day delivery to my man. Mm. Right? What we can actually do is suggest to the C, the C D or the computer shop  your manufacturer can send directly to Peter  via us, I then say  via us. Aye, you'll get the bill. Mm mm. But  we will send the bill\\nTo that shop. you can \\nMm mm. send them the bill and we'll send them the goods. They, Peter, if he found out where they were coming from what might he do? Phone them. To the supplier. He might cut out the middle man you see. Cos he might be able to go straight to the ba , the\\nYeah. Now obviously, we don't \\nwant to lose his business so we protect him but we don't say  it's coming from there. We are, we represent him, it's his delivery van \\nYeah. that delivers to Peter. And that's third party carriage forward which is even, and Peter's even happier because he doesn't even have to wait two days now, he gets his delivery next day. And the bill he, that he gets at the same as the time as the delivery, and what's normal credit conditions? Thirty days. Thirty days. So when does the thirty days start ticking by? We get our money back much quicker. That's right. You do. So instead of waiting ten days for delivery and then the invoice being,tha , you know being delivered with the goods  when you open \\nYes. it up there's the bill  the bill can be eleven days in advance of that which means improved \\nWell that means everybody's happier. The manufacturer's happier\\nThat's right. cos he gets his money quicker. Well done. The shopkeeper's happier because he gets \\nAha. his money quicker. We're happier  because we get paid quicker and the end-user's happier cos he's \\nAha. got his product quicker. That is it.

And I bet you, if you look at how many of your accounts are not using carriage forward when they should  you would be amazed. Existing on your roller now. And so, why so many don't know about carriage \\nI know. forward\\nYeah. They don't understand. That's it. They don't understand what it means. Th ,ca , what do most people use carriage forwards for? Just collecting from somewhere else and bringing it back to themselves. Bringing it back, sending it back. Yeah. Invoice them \\nlet me, the o the other thing we can do is if it's broken  the shop can send it back but the man, the other person pays.\",\n",

Or sometimes they've got an account in your name. And that's why we don't make money on carriage forwards cos we don't sell carriage forwards for the positive reasons, we say, well if they don't want them send them back, or if they're damaged send them back. Yeah. Or if you have to have, I used to do it for erm  West Bro , er  Northampton Brewery. Banson's \\nBanson's \\nBrewery. Erm, it was, was Banson Brewery. Er no it wasn't Ba , Banson's Brewery, erm \\nAnson's \\nno sorry, I'm I'm in the wrong trade, it was er  gas cylinders. And we used to send back the erm\\nThe valves. the valves. They used to er se , we couldn't carry the empty ga , you can imagine that's not express parcel stuff, but the valves er, would sometimes need er replacing and we would send them a valve and, and while, instead of having any down time, we would give them  you know deliver the spare, have the spare come back for repair. Do you understand? Cos there's a lot of this maintenance thing that goes on as \\nMm. as well isn't there  with businesses? It isn't just  service doesn't end at the sale,so , a lot of things have to have after-care don't they? Or \\nMm. a service contract with them and there's lots of business, repeat business. Another one we did, er, out of South Wales was hip replacement  kit \\nGosh! to erm    the hospitals  and erm  they would  appar , I might be wro , I'm sure this is the way she explained it to me cos one of the girls in the branches did explain it to me once, and they said they have a choice of joints, like the doctor would say  er \\nNew brain. your due to, you know, you, you were due for your hip replacement. Right. And what they would do is have a look and say ooh that's, ooh that's about your size, that's about it. Right. They don't make a joint do they, for you, you, you, you and you? They're all sort of standard sort of size pieces of kit. Cos it's an engineering job really isn't it? Yeah.\",\n",
       " \"You know. Yeah. Providing you're looking after the blood supply, I mean, you know, the cardiovascular bit, you know, it's a bit of an engineering job. So they,th , you, you have a choice of hips, and they also have a bit of saw, a bit of sawing kit and screw in, you know, have delicate screws. Cos it's, it is pins and stuff isn't it, that makes\\nYeah. the hip work? So they have little screws to, you know, to go into the bone and little er  delicate instruments which are highly developed instruments and manufactured by certain pattern. And they actually supply them in special sealed containers, you know, little  cases that er, so, when you're doing a hip job you have a little kit come  from the supplier. And what they do, is they give them a couple of choices of bo , you know, hip joints to go for and the guy decides, the surgeon decides, does his job and then the kit goes back to the manufacturer again  and then when the, another hospital orders it they make up a, another kit. Obviously there's a lot of sterilizing going on in the meantime and all this. But they don't, these tools are used again, and again, and again  you know. The screws they make are, are to be there in the body  and the parts are in the bodies, but the bits they don't use come back and then they are put back into stock again. And our service was so good  to hospitals,, that they'd be somebody on the table  well where's the bit? Mm. She's just getting her anaesthetic now. Well where's the bits you know? And they're ringing up  er  Julie about it, and say Julie  well, they're here. What's happened? Because the service was so good  they'd all, you know, they'd forget about the delivery that would be there. She'd supply them. So it was there? Yes. Already \\nYeah. there. And then one day it didn't. Can't find this bit. They're always going down for anaesthetic, we can't find it. Now she's just had a pre-med now. Right okay. We can't find it. Can you find it for me? Okay then. Traced it. But of course it took a little bit of time, an hour or so, and th , the woman came round again, they said can't do you today\\ncan't find the joint. So, she came back out of er  pre-med, had a nice happy half hour on a bit of valium and came back out of it again. Went back up to the ward cos there was no bit. Do you know where it was? In the erm  gate house  at the hospital. We had delivered it but they hadn't taken it from the gate house to  you know, normal procedure but they, we delivered it normally but they hadn't taken it to the exact part of the hospital it was going to. So, Julie sent the patient a bunch of flowers  and sh , and said sorry for the de , for the delay, you know it's there tomorrow, and she had this, she had it done again. But really, what, all they wanted to do was save face from the hospital because it wasn't our fault  but she used a bit of  you know, we won't embarrass the hospital  we'll say \\nAnd then our customer's happy. bit of customer care, but really \\nAnd, well \\nwe all, we'll lose face with the patient\\nMm mm. because we int gonna, we haven't gotta worry about what she says about, but he sa , the hospital didn't wanna lose face, but I mean, the hospital said thank you . Cos they were saying will they tell her, you know the part hasn't come and, so we said okay, let's pretend the part didn't get there. Send her a bunch of flowers. But really it had got there but again  But what I'm saying is, that service  of carriage forward  we were making almost as much money on the kit coming back  cos we could have charged another\\nIt's five quid isn't it? Yeah. It's five pound at the moment is it? It has been up to nine or ten pound  for \\nMm. return. Because it ca , most, we do lose a lot of money on carriage forwards.\",\n",
       " \"If I talk to, if you talk to our operations they will say, oh my God! Do you know why? Because, we don't know what we're carrying. A lot of carriage forwards \\nare returns and damages. Mm. And they're in a terrible state when we pick them up. Because, you can imagine working for us, you received something and thought that's no good and can't use it, what happens to it then in your warehouse or  despa \\nJust sta , lays there. And what happens to it while it's ? Kicked around. Kicked around. Kicked about. Right. Broken. Broken and all that. And, what did you say that we get a lot of claims on carriage forward? Damaged foodstuff. You have to insure them don't you, carriage forward of course? Yeah. That's why we have to\\nSo \\nNo you don't. Yeah. Tha that means we're paying out \\nBut you see the problem is \\nif we do actually find out. Yeah, you see the trouble is though we're so open to abuse. because\\nYeah. people, they don't rush back, they don't wanna urgently express back a carriage forward, they don't work. What they want is, they get on the phone and say that's no good, send me another one. And we send them the replacement, and they let the broken one sit there. How many times have you  supposed to have taken something back  or have it repaired or something and it's sat there, and it's sat there, and it's sat there, and it's sat there  and it's collected du , I've got things round the house that I've been working on and that I've gotta, I've gotta  and it's collected dust. You know, that's another project that went sort of slowly the way. Erm, and what I'm saying is, we don't address the things that aren't urgent \\nYeah. we only address the urgent things. But we do leave \\nYeah. ourselves, well we've gotta protect ourselves as carriers against other people saying  ah! We broke that, or that was broke  er, but we'll blame the carrier now and look at it, then our security guy goes out and they know it's been sitting around someone's  you know, it's been there for months! And er, we we, we are open to abuse on them. But that doesn't mean to say that what Danny said  was very valuable, and as you said Adrian, the four, the four parties, the receiver, the thirty party receiver, the people who are paying the bills  buyer and us are very happy in many cases with  using carriage forward in a positive way not just for returns \\nMm mm. yeah? The returns do get a bit dodgy I find. But we still do it  cos we insure it, we, charge an extra fiver every time  then it's good money. I'm stopping you through your list  Phil. Well I mean, I've got a \\nAny more? quite a few on here. Is there any ones that you want me to pin point at all or \\nErm le , what I wanna do is just get, just insure that we know the difference between what is giving the customer the, the benefit and the features. So we probably won't go through them all. But \\nNo. let's just discuss our way round a couple of other things because these are, this is your product knowledge now isn't it? Yeah. This is what you need to know about selling the service. It's no good, er  talking about how you do something, how you do is not what they're interested in. So whats, that's how you do it. How do you do it? the customer. It's, it's what can please me. Cuddly toy . What's in it for me? The with them factor. What it is in it for me? Okay. I've got liability options. What d'ya mean by that, liability options? Well like being insu , like people have got a choice of different options of insurances and \\nThat's a good one. Now if I said, ooh! We offer good liability options. We can give you  transport liability at, what level's that? Aha. Five thousand pounds, ten thousand pounds, and fifteen thousand pounds costing three, three, six, and nine pound respectively. Five, ten, and fifteen. Which is forward transit . Don't be like that. What is the free? Fifteen pounds a kilo. Sorry, five, sorry I got that one. Three,\\nSix and nine. Six and nine. and nine. And the free one is? Fifteen pound a kilo.\",\n",

We're limited  I won't ta , I don't like using the word problems without . The reason why \\nWhat about the \\nwe can afford to offer such good liability cover is the risk is very minimal.

We can get excellent rates from insurance companies \\nThat's right. because we are so good. Now we , actually\\nYeah. we are our own\\nI know about this. inge , we're our own  which means that we are, our problems are so limited  that we actually carry the liability ourselves, we don't even have to use an external  company  to get the rates on. We are so , so what I'm saying is, we can afford to offer marvellous cover  because it's, because erm, the risk is minimal. Dixons Starsfield got er, the same as ours really, got  . Who does? Who does? Dixon Starsfield, Dixons, Currys. Right. Where they, they offer extended five year warranties. Now the chance of you actually needing a \\nYeah. five year warranty on a T V is .

You understand that, right? Yeah. Now \\nBut when you got to the options, now \\nThe full liability, yeah? what are you saying now fi , up to five thousand pounds? Per item, per per assignment. Right. Regardless of weight. What's that, what  right \\nYou're buying a  aren't you? You pay three pound extra\\nOh extra? Yeah.

How do you achieve a rate \\nSorry can, can anyone \\nsay if you \\ncan \\nwell \\nI just say\\nhe doesn't pay fifteen pounds a kilo Adrian, he pays nothing. He pays the rate you  ask him to pay\\nYeah. and, inbuilt in that rate  Mr , is fifteen \\nOh I see. pounds coverage for every kilo of weight. That's right. So if you have a thousand  kilo pallet  it's fifteen thousand pounds. But if your item weighs a half a kilo, we'll round it up to the first kilo so that's any valid for fifteen pounds. Right. Now obviously that's worth a lot more than fifteen pounds to you isn't it? Right. So what I suggest you do is pay an additional three pounds which means that that is now covered  for up to five thousand pounds regardless of it's weight.\",\n",

So if I let you drive my Rover home, would you? Definitely. Yeah . And if I let you drive my Rover home, would you? She said yes to the actual question.

Right, he knew what she was talking about, she'd got it written down and she was gonna get that information. But sometimes it can sound too  I know this didn't happen\\nYeah, comes a bit too \\nit's just  \\nI mean I'm not suggesting you, you behave like that on the phone\\nbut what I'm saying is, awareness now, I'm just slagging off the awareness. When it sounds rehearsed, it sounds, like, that. And it doesn't sound quite as clear as if you have to think about who you're talking to. So the fact that you struggled Phil \\nMm mm. to find the next question, the customer knows you're thinking. Ah  that's interesting. Try and get that now  buy yourself a bit of time\\nMm. think about that. Let me , let me think about that. Do you mind if I come back to you on that one?

Paul, would you like to ask Carly a question? I didn't understand it. I've done three questions of each. Oh God Paul ! Do you understand it now? No I, no I understand what you're saying, it's just that I thought you said three questions of each. I done three open, three limited, and three  yes and no questions.

What I'm saying is  is sometimes slowing the pace  and simply \\nYeah. let her think a little longer because  and then she'll say, oh! And then she's just think of that. With Phil's hesitance  we got a bit more. And Phil was thinking  I wonder whether this is about  and I'm  trying to think of the next question . No. Which is the question of what you feel when you're in the field out there trying to work something through. Which calls \\nActually you've hit the nail on the head there didn't you? Mm? When you said  Phil thought he wasn't, I'm not listening. No. Because that's what it's all about. Yes. And when you're listening you're watching for body language as well. Mm. And so if you have not been concentrating on the question\\nYeah. you will probably have recognized the body that says  I'm prepared to give you more. Now, to be fair  that comes with experience. Of course. Listening, as you become more comfortable and you become, you've done it a few times  you know what you're gonna have to say  and then you, you er, you listen more carefully to the answers. But the listening is the key. Paul had it well prepared and really she sa , but sh all his answers met with  a logical sequence didn't it? Mm mm. Very well done  and he spent a lot of time working on that did you notice? I'm not saying that's, okay, you got a bit misled by the instructions but don't worry, but he still gave  you could see that  you know  he was, you know, he was just \\nYeah. you know, he was caught in a \\nHe was  concentrating . train of thought. He was erm , he was trying \\nThanks. very hard and e , good, good preparation does take effort. I mean I know we're only playing here, but it does take effort and, practised effort becomes easier  it doesn't become hard work. It's like  playing a good game of squash, squash, to get a better game  and it's not so hard  because you're off to, you, you're fit for the game. And that's what you'll do, you'll become fit. You'll be a better player. As you say, when you're on the phone you get those silences you just of go, mm mm, mm\\nWell done Jenny! And like,\\nWell erm, what's ha , what would you call those?\",\n",

       " \"Yes. Please do. Just to illustrate how important this thing is, you've probably all come across and it really irritates me, you see people interviewing people on television  and they've got their clipboard there and they've obviously got a prepared question so they can't falter  and fine, that means they've prepared it. And they ask a question and somebody's very open with the answer and they da , they just,sa expand on that answer  and then, two or \\nAha. three questions later they ask them the very question they just answered \\nE e expect  \\nand that really irritates me! And that's purely and simply because they're just not listening. Oh. The easiest thing in the world to take off that question\\nYeah. so that it's\\nso think about that because \\nYeah. And you'll lo \\nyou don't want to get the backs up of your customers by asking them questions . That is right. And you'll losing the point of why \\nAbsolutely. you're asking the question. See\\nAha. you're not, you're not paid to ask questions, you're paid to get in , information. Info. Yeah? That's the point. So that fact that you can't think of a next question Phil\\nMhm. don't worry, you've got some information. We can all ask questions  later  okay? What you really want then is a way to sort of happenings or embarrassments because you're a bit stuck of where you want to go.\",\n",

I think one of the things Phil can do in that si \\nDon't worry about it. or anybody could do in that situation is having asked a question, they're a bit hesitant about  er, the next question then simply throw in there to buy yourself some time something like  ee, is that all? Or, is any more that you can add to that? Just to give yourself a bit of time\\nMm. Or repeat the question. for the next question. It will help \\nYeah. you. Like we've just suggested. Oh have you? Or, what was your way of doing it before you said? When, when you wanted to know where Mandy went? Can you give us, tell us about that Paul? Well I kept asking her, it made hard work, yeah.\",\n",

       " \"And rightly so as well. Well done. Carly would you like to demonstrate yours \\nKath. now? Er \\nCould I say, say something? Yeah. I just think  I just think  it's quite important for us all to realize  I did a, when I used to do a similar job to this  it took me a long time before I realized  that the customer, you know on the phone doesn't know that your  you shouldn't have asked an open question there \\nOh. on the close  and it comes, it just comes with practise, get all \\nRight. from practise doesn't it? Which is exactly it. what I'm saying is is, you can, it doesn't matter how you ask the question, but sometimes \\nwhat I'm trying to help you practise, cos we're not, we're very good at asking closed questions in conversations but don't very often recognize, but you know, we, we we we, we'll zip backwards and forwards, and that's okay, but I want you to do consciously is know what type of questions you're asking because you can sometimes be hitting a brick wall and thinking I'm getting anywhere here and it's because you're asking too many closed questions. Mm mm. And you're making it sound like an interrogation. Erm, especially when you're in front of a screen er or you're in front of a, a form that you're, someone's saying get the traffic profile out and th what they send, what they, how many they send, it can sound like an interrogational. Get the buyer, get the product, get the carrier, get, and so on like that. You've got to be careful that you are not losing the skill of a conversation. Mm. Open question  what th va , advantage of open question is, is you do a  less of it  and they\\nMore of it. More of it. And that's why it, on a foundation course we keep the questioning very simple. Justin's experiences has tooken it, taken it further than that which is brilliant, and he can apply those skills straight away. And if you've got those skills apply to them job, I'm not suggesting you don't, but remember  the first part of a, a tele , er a telephone or a face to face sales negotiation is,th th two of these and one of these. Right? You should you be posing the questions and letting the discussion take place. Posing the questions, controlling it  but posing it and letting it go. Right? And you're gaining information. When you've gathered information  a , and and come to a conclusion  erm interesting, we may have something for you there. And that's when you get your presenter out and start matching to what the customer wants. Now you've gone through an alternative yesterday  and we know, we ta , we don't talk what is built in by design, what do we talk about? We tell them what's built in by design and then we\\nTell them the advantages. of what they get out of it. . And we keep it simple. One feature  maybe one or two benefits  and you don't have to tell them the whole story. Mm mm. As you said Bill, pull out the benefits and features that are appropriate to what you've heard. Er, there may be something you're interested in there? Now there are tighter ways of actual sales negotiations but we haven't got the time to go into it today. You'll have to come back on your selli , your course to do this. Okay? Or you ca , if you can do it on your own, brilliant! Run with it now. But what I want you to do is gather information, this is your answers, and match what you're doing  er, what we sa provide with what you found out then. Okay. And you'll find out what method by just simply questioning them  about the . Let me just check before we start that everybody's got this. I'm sure Danny, Jenny, and Carly have, but just because  we've gone half way, can I just let the other three finish off their presentation? Cos they've sat and done the preparation.\",\n",

Tt Let's see, I'm sixty one now, so sixty one that's er twenty one isn't it? Twenty one. Yeah. Twenty one ye Nineteen twenty one when I first came to . But it had been just  just a wee little village then. We had we had the two schools, the  School and the what we call the Boys School, that was the other one on on the green and it the girl's school, near this school, you started there as an infant between five and seven. And then the girls stayed on till they were fourteen. But when the boys became seven they they went on to this school on the green. Now the village green in those days was all ashes, completely all ashes. N not as it is today, beautiful green grass and we used to play er cricket, football, marbles er pitch card, ring tor, er duckie stone, and all  that of course the village in those days was divided into two parts and if you lived over  's Hill you was a downtowner. And if you lived this end of the village you was an uptowner, see? And we used to arrange football teams, cricket teams, during the before you went into school, playtime and very often when you came out of school. But if you went over the hill, after school time, then you were in for a fairly rough time the other end, you were challenged and all sorts of things. And of course there were no houses down where the village ha past the village hall in those days. I think  Row was about the last row in  and of course you'd got all the fields, Gardens and what have you. And there was nothing till you got to the Grange, absolutely nothing. And there was just, well  Road, other than er the  Estate was pretty well the same as it is today, very little improved. And the w the road might have been widened but the houses are the same and er the er of course with a lot of The old factories have been pulled down, Mills was pulled down, that was a v very prosperous f factory at one time, when I was a boy, but er I'm afraid that went according to you know  the lack of trade. It was er The village centre is about the same as it was when I was a boy, more busier of course, all the private houses that were on the front, you know, Street? That's all been altered,i they've all been made into shops  and spoilt the you know, the and there used to be old  's, the shoe shop and Mr.  's watch shop and Mrs  's pastry shop. Mr , the bar local barber, who's son lives next door, for years, he used to start at nine o'clock in the morning and finish at nine o'clock at night. Still cutting hair at nine o'clock at night and shaving people, penny and tuppence a time. Old Mr , the old er, our only, as I could remember,centurian , died when he was a hundred and two. He was going to have his hair cut w in every and a shave  Mr er  's barber shop right up until practically the morning he died. And he did his own gardening, right up, when he was a hundred, he was fit as a fiddle when he was a hundred, doing his own gardening. Where about did your family live? The first house they lived in \\n? The first house that I can remember was on  Road. That's just by where your friend lives. lived in that house there and it was three shillings a week, I think it was, two up and two down. One biggish living room and a little back kitchen with no water and no sanitation and if you wanted to dispose of your water you'd have to take it out on the roadside and chuck it down the main drain. And you used to have to fetch your water from the pump's head, just round the corner, outside toilets, we used to have to go about fifty yards to use the toilet. And then you'd share it with somebody else on the same row. Yeah. And it was  a fight for the f towards the end of the week it was a fight to  sort of say, Well,Shan't be able to move it,use it  until t the man comes. But although in that house there was eight of us\\nThat was your? Mum and Dad and six kids, there was four in one bedroom, me sister, me and her my Me two sisters in the slept in in a double bed in me Mam's bedroom and we four lads slept in the back bedroom w w whi which was just just big enough to get a double bed in, as you can see, and there was two that slept at the top, and two slept at the bottom. And you can guess what that was like with four four of us in bed,Hey    Wi move your feet. And and of course y you didn't have extra blankets in those days, you had to fetch your Dad's topcoat up and put on if you're cold.\",\n",
       " \"That's sort of business. What did your Dad do for a living? Well Dad, he worked  in the ammu in the munitions at Coventry, down  Lane for the Humber people, during the war. That's how he g He's native is here, he's a native of , there was a very big sam family of them, about seventeen brothers. And they always formed the  Village Church Choir,, see? But he was tt er a twist hand in the hosiery trade, making  socks, and he worked in the last mobile, not mobile, er mechanical stocking manufacturers, owned by my uncle, Mr Frank , in  Street and th what we used to called  Street. It was never known as  Street in those days, it was called the  Street. And they had a big tt gas engine there with a great big flywheel and you can see these machines today, they didn't make them round, they used to make them flat. See? And i the bobbins an and that used to run across like that, the shuttle always used to run across like that\\nFrom side to side ? Aye. And er great big pulleys with three inch leather belts, if they'd have done it in, er do it in these days and the factory inspector would have cut him to pieces. And I can see the o old father when he used to have s want to make the mo the machine immobile, while he did something particular to it, so like you switching the electricity off, well,h he used to have to take the belts off. He used to get this brush handle and shove it in between the belts, like that, and  twist it off like that. Then when he wanted it to go again he used to get the  th the belt, the leather belt, and er sort of hook it on to the lower end of the cast iron pulley and follow it round until it went on. .And that's how they used to start the o and the old gas engine it used to pop pop pop, pop pop pop, pop pop pop pop. .A y That was the last one  of the mechanized o Well, it was the only mo er mechanized stocking stockinger's shop in the village. The rest was all hand operated, which was , was infested by stockinger's shops in those days. That was the framework? The framework \\nknitters? Yeah. And you can You can see the n the buildings And there are one or two of them pulled down now. I don't remember all I The last man I can remember working one was Mr , Joe , and he was down he The last one I can remember, as I say, was being operated in in the yard just down  Street. Opposite to Mr where Mr Fred  used to live, at the back of his house. That was the last one I can remember being worked there, but I do remember Frank , where me Dad worked. Then of course, me Dad, when that closed down, it was like everything else, it's as bad as it is today, for jobs. They couldn't get work and my poor old Dad went miles round these outside villages, on a a old lady's push-bike, trying to find work. And the work they'd go for They were building their house, they'd v volunteer to take the footings out, or dig trenches to, or find out which farmer would have the threshing engine to do the, you know, to help them with the threshing, which was arduous work in those days. Fetching coal and water for this  poor old steam engine , taking the chaff away, which was a filthy, horrible job. . Carrying sacks of beans and s oats, up into the storage block in sixteen stone bags and twelve stone bags. And how they used to They used to put them on like a You know what these two-wheeled barrows like they put the sacks on, don't you? Well, it was a similar thing to that, only bigger. tt They'd got two handles which was b made it mobile, two wheels, and used it Have four sacks at the end of this threshing engine, hanging on little hooks, and and a bloke there seeing that it got filled alright and it when it was full, they used to run this thing underneath a sack, crank it up by hand, like that, till they got it to the required height, then nestle it on their shoulders, you see there was a There's a there's an art in carrying c In carrying coal and there's an art in carrying corn and there's an art in carrying beef. There's an art in carrying everything, which makes it easy, if you know how. But if you don't know how, it'll kill you. Same as all farm work, see, farm work They don't know as they're born these days, these youngsters don't, when they come to talking about farming. used to have to w run the old b back the old horse and cart into the co crew yard which had been standing all year with about umpteen beasts on it, trampling it down, more straw, trample it down, more straw, trample it down. Then in back end they used to empty this crew yard and you used to have to handle all that with forks, muck forks, they used to call them, and that was big biggest fork and by God, they used to pull your heart out. You can guess what it was like, straw and everything, being trampled down all winter, sodden with with water and everything. And then when that was done you used to have to take it to the field,and put it in we we used to put it in big heaps and then come back, fill it up, and then go out and spread it. And \\nSo \\nthe o the old farmer used to go along with his one furrow plough, and a pair of good horses, and it was no mean feat. I mean it th th they were called farm labourers in those days, but they weren't labourers, they were clever men, clever men, make no mistake about that. I mean today, you've got to be an educated man to know how to even, they've got er tractors and everything, but in those days you'd got to set your plough furrow out so as you you could run your plough down your first one, and then as you as you ploughed your first furrow out you'd got to plough your next one into it. Ten inch furrow. And keep old Dobbin in his in his furrow. One in the furrow and one on the stubble, see? And you used to do that at a ten inch blade all day, up and down that field. Day in and day out, today they can Same with old mowing machines, they used to go out To open a field up in those days, they used to have to go round with a scythe. Go right round a f these the field and cut your first swathe out and tie it up with a a load of the straw that you'd cut and bind it up, bundle it up and shove that in the hedge bottom. Then the old old binder used to come in with two two year old stalwarts, horses, and he used to go round this field and it used to take him days. And then after the first seven or eight s cuttings, then they used to come along stooking. You used to get two shears underneath your arm like that, and they used to  drop them down like that, across your knees and top them like that, see? And you used to put eight to a stook, that was so it would dry out, you see? And er and when that was been in the field whatever days, depending on the weather, if you'd got a good dry summer well you'd perhaps take it in in after a week, you see? And then we used to and they used to come along with the old cart and start leading. And when they'd finished milking at, they'd usually start milking about half past four in the morning, some of them used to go delivering milk and then they used to go leading. What we call leading, that was picking your corn up. And they'd knock off for a bit of dinner, come back, and do the second milking. Wash your cans up erm and er and then they'd go and finish off in the corn fields. And I used to go down you used to see all the mams and kids going down the moors here, taking their dad's tea, down in the fields, so they could have a bit of something and then finish as  got dark. And then they'd wind their way home with the old port and everything. And hay harvesting was a different kettle of fish altogether. Admitting you went in the fields, but you didn't open the field up in th erm with a hay harvesting, you used to go in with your cutter, straight away. Take , you didn't bother about the headlands, you'd do your headlands after you'd mown all your and then of course then that was left to dry, after two or three days, depending on the weather again. You used to go in the fields and turn it and when it had been turned they used to start leading. And i if the man in the field had got a grudge against a bloke who was stacking i or taking off in the stack yard he could make life hell. Cos there's a way of putting hay on the cart and you used to have to start one lot in the corner, one lot in the other corner, another lot at the back, another lot at the back at the other side and then you'd fill in your centre. See? And when you'd got your centre filled in, you used to start again,, one in the corner, one the other corner, one between the eyes, one in the middle and back again. Now if you'd got grudge against the bloke who was taking it off in the shop, in the farmyard, after when you got back home, of course you had to come I mean they didn't stick it in the field, like they do now. You used to have to bring the stuff to the farmyard to store it, you see? And if the old boy in the field had got a grudge against the bloke taking it off he used to shove it anywhere so he'd have to pull it off, instead of following the the seam round, you see? By God it was hard, it was hard work in those days. And see the same with mangle tagging,dunnet tagging, sugar beet pulling. Sugar beeting in those days, you used to stick the old plough in, plough them up and then we had to go along knocking them, to knock all the soil off, then chop the tops off, put them in heaps, go along with the old horse and cart. Load them up and then t take them to the heap  and ready for off again to the market. did it, it was all road transported in them days. M sh you see that I was saying, to be a farm labourer in those days you'd got to be a clever man, you'd got to know how much wheat to shove to an acre, no waste, you see? You couldn't afford the waste. Even though it was cheap in those days the farm farmer couldn't afford to waste it. Oh no. And then of course your sugar beet went direct to Colwick and it used to go by horse and cart in those days. And er but your y mangles and your potatoes, they went in pits, in the field. And of course you your mangles was for your a and your turnips for your Winter fodder. And that was another d another task. You used to have a special chopper for your mangles and it was like a big mincing machine, with a great big wheel on, and you used to fill it full of er mangles, or turnips and it used to come out like chips. And then you used to mix it up with bran and oats and cake and that sort of stuff, for the horses. An and then we used to have to and there was no no such a thing as bales in those days, duckie. No such a thing as bales of straw, it was loose hay stacked, and you used to cut it with a big hay knife. Oh, great big hefty thing it was, it was an art to cut hay, with these big knives. And then we used When it g we used to fetch it off then like, cut it and then fetch it off in sheaths, like h , you know, like a big slice of bread. And my God, again it was hard work, we used to put it in this hay chopper, pile it in and chop  and it used to come out like chaff. And that was for your horses, you see? An and they had to be fed. The horse man used to have to go before anybody else, to feed the horses so that, and groom them, currycomb them, water them and do everything, before any of the farmers dare take them out on the fields. Yeah. So were these temporary jobs your father had on the farm? They'd do anything, my duck. Did you used to go and help on the farm as well? Oh aye, of course you do, you had to do, you used to go tater- picking, my duckie, for one and sixpence a day. And if you were lucky, and you got a good farmer, he'd let you take one o what we call roasters, home. So you your Mam could shove them in the oven and roast them for you, take your own bucket. You'd be, oh perhaps twenty or thirty of us, in these fields and you used to do so A length, what you call a length. You'd perhaps have three of you picking up er the potatoes and then another length, another wat another lot of kids, another three used to do another length. And then when the old spinney used to come up again,if you were lucky, he'd probably He had a probably a little wait before you'd finished the other, you see? Keglet pulling. Stone-picking. Oh, singling, mangles, turnips, anything like that. One and sixpence a day, but Mr   was the best paid, was two bob a day. And we always u Everybody used to try and get to  's. This was while you were still at school ? This was while we were still at scho Well, you used to have a week off of school, my darling, for tater-picking, only. When I was kids. Did you do any other jobs, part-time \\nPaper \\njobs while you were still at school ? Paper boy. Taking it out and all these what's name, half a crown a week. On  Lane, walking it. Come rain, come shine. And you had to put it in the letter box, you daren't leave it in the in the . Milk round, with the old ladle and jug. And you'd be surprised what you had to put your milk in in those days. Anything. And we used to do that twice a day, my darling, not once a day, twice a day. And then come and then wash your own cans out, and you used to carry them all through all round the village. Then I got a bike, and I was alright then, I could put two milk churns on. But you couldn't fill th the milk churns then, you used to have the half pint and pint measures, hanging inside your milk. And it was milk, full of cream. When you've got up next morni And then we I can tell you another thing, and very few people know about it, especially I bet you don't know wha what they called beastlings, do you? Well in those days beastlings was a lux it wasn't a luxury because you could get it for nothing. They used The farmers used to give them to you. And it was milk, after they'd milked the cow first time, after she'd had a calf, well the first milking, they usually got blood in the milk, you see? But the second milking, and so forth on, perhaps the thir second or third milking they used to get milk, what they called beastlings and it was very often too much for the calves to take, so she got a full bag. So they had to draw it off, you see? And if anybody had got a cow and it calved, we used to go to him and say could we have the beastlings, please. Then your Mam used to make p pastry and put these beastlings in and make a beastling custard.\",\n",
       " \". And it was beautiful. You didn't need you didn't need eggs in that, so forth and fifth, in that stuff. Full of all the vitamins and everything. You used to And then you could also go to the local farmer's and take away a quart jug, for two penn'orth of skimmed milk. And that sort of thing. Did your Mum do any sort of work at all? Mum, she'd got to do, darling. Six kids, Dad on a few shillings a week, when he was out of work, Mam had to go out scrubbing, washing. My poor mother had got corns on across her her knuckles, right to the very day she died, from scrubbing for different people, and skivvying, up there. these skivvies, in, what we called skivvies in those days, at these big houses up round a about the village. Y you got about twelve and sixpence a w a year. And w half a day a w a week and had to be in by nine o'clock. My mother was was servant to , at the croft up there,about fifteen bob a week and she didn't know when she used to come home. Eight o'clock in the morning till eight nine o'clock at night. Cooking dinner, and if she got a what's-a-name,if they'd got parties on, she used to stop there had to stop there till two. What happened to you kids while she was out working ? we had to look after ourselves. And if me Dad wasn't home at work,a out at work, he used to have to do it. My father, six kids on a Friday night, we used to put a bucket of water on the hot sink, on the old gas stove and my father used to bath us six kids in front of the fire. Friday night. And never once on a Sunday morning did that man fail to get up and cook our breakfast and polish our shoes, so that we'd go smart and good to Sunday School.\",\n",
       " \"Never once. Yeah. My poor old mother, and me sister finished at the same big house, servant there for them. Same Oh. And the mothers had to do it in those days, half a crown to do all the washing for this woman. And you used to get up and light the copper fire, fill this old copper, which held about ten gallons, and then put plenty of stack o slack on it. And it was there was no what's-a-name in there. I can remember me first Mother's, what she called, automatic washer. By God, I can remember that as if it was yesterday. And it was a little square thing, about two foot square, with a er  and about eight inches deep, tt and you used to put the clothes in, with warm water and your your powder, close the top and you used to have a handle, and Like that there, and you used to be backwards and forwards, like that,, with this paddle going backwards and forwards inside it. And that's what they called the first automatic washer. Aye. And of course they'd never They very rarely thought of washing clothes in tap water those days, it was all rainwater. Every house had got it's own it's own rainwater tub. And by God, it were a luxury if w you  washed out holding hot water first thing in the morning. You used to go out in the in the wash-house and wash yourselves, under the cold water tap. Up to the eyes in snow, up to the toilet which was about twenty yards away, that was where lived then, in the house where  Building Society is now, lived there for thirty four year.\",\n",
       " \"Where's that? On  Street. Can you remember things that your mother used to do to make the money go further when \\nI can. when you were short? Oh, yes, well I mean I o obviously I When she worked She used to get up I'll tell you another thing that she used to do. She used to get up  in the morning, every Tuesday and Friday and catch the half past seven bus, from  to Nottingham and another bus down to  Boulevard, to Miss  's, do a day's skivvying and come back again, and then do her ironing and so forth, at night-time. And my God, they weren't such facilities as er what's-a-name, if it was er wet weather. You Every house had got lines across the the kitchen, you used to put hang the washing in the kitchen, to get it dry. On the fireguard, above the fireplace,i there wasn't many houses that hadn't got a line across the fireplace, like that. And you'd put handkerchiefs and collars and that, and you used to have to starch the collars in those days. Robin's Starch, Beckett's Blue, and all this and that. And then of course they used to iron them. And it was hell's own job with sitting in the kitchen at night-time, a little kitchen, with washing hanging above your head, so the poor bugger could get it dry. This was other people's washing that she took in ? Aye. And her own. And we didn't We hadn't got a wash-house of our own, we used to have to go to Miss  's, down the road, to do our washing. Borrow Miss  's. Why was that? You hadn't got We hadn't got a washing we hadn't got a wash-house. Oh, you were lucky if you'd got a wash-house attached to your house, in those days. You had to go to go to Miss  's and have it do it there, borrow her copper, and wringer. Blimey, no, it was a luxury if you'd got a washer then. And i and of course when she worked When Mum used to work in Nottingham you could er be assured that you'd have some bacon on a Saturday, and Sunday, because she used to call at T. N.  's in  Street, and buy sixpenny worth of bits of bacon. Which was, say, when they'd started the the roll of bacon, there always used to be some little bits before they got the full rashers, well, you couldn't sell those, you couldn't s I mean even though things were tight in those days, you couldn't sell any sort of bacon, you either sold best back, or you sold belly bacon. And the bits that you got off, well, we poorer families used to have it then. Had to have that. Eggs were twenty four a shilling, little little eggs, looked like bullet eggs, came from Egypt. You still had to ask your Dad for a top off the egg if you were if you were a poor family. So only your Dad got an egg? On occasions, yes. When he was in work, and then sh we used to go to the local butcher's shop on a Saturday night, with the old  bag, six o'clock Saturday night to Mr  's. That's where  's is now on on the hill. And my Dad used to say Go to Mr  's, and tell him you've come for your Dad's meat. Half a crown and that's what you got. Now half a crown in those days was a lot of money, you had to a full day's work for half a crown, make no mistake on that. Half a crown And you used to come away with a big piece of flat brisket and if he's got any sausage left, or bits a of pork pies, he used to shove a bit of that in. And Mr , me Dad wants to know if you've got a ham bone? He says one day, me lad,if you don't come back quick, he said, I shall sell it, threepence, and there was a lot of ham of it, in those days. Bones. From the butchers. Potherbs. What? Can you explain what potherbs is ? Well, I told you what potherbs was, potherbs is what you buy, you go and you perhaps get a couple of sticks of c celery, that was taken off the side, you know? The trimmings. Carrots. Parsnips. Turnips. Onion. And they used to make two penny worth up and that's what they called potherbs, in those days. Why they were called potherbs, don't ask me, but it was always known as potherbs. Two penny worth of bones from the butchers, and two penny worth of potherbs. Now that used to go in the old stew pot and they used to boil the bones till the meat dropped off, and the vegetables And that was your most of your meal for the rest of the week. And in the morning you used to have soaky very few pe very few lads had breakfast, bacon and eggs, in those days. It was soaky or porridge. What's soaky \\nPorridge? Soaky? Soaky was a basin full of bread, with sugar and milk and er a basin full of tea, with sugar and milk, and bread soaked in it. And you used to have that, that was your breakfast. And we Nestle's milk. Nestle's milk conjures up a lot of memories for me.\",\n",
       " \". We had it in all ways, shapes and forms. Spread on your bread, eat it by the spoonful, great big chunks of thick bread with Ho e home made jam,y your Mam didn't buy those jams in those days, me darling. She made her own, did she ? She made her own chutney, and made her own pickles, even though she was at work. She used to make all the And er home-made wine. And always in my attic, in our bedroom, as kids, you could always see dried dock leaves and dried stinking nanny, for poultices, for abscesses and boils.\",\n",
       " \"Always. And  tea. You always had a  bush, that was horrible! Detestable stuff, but my Dad always insisted that we had an egg cup full, once a week. What was if for? To keep your blood clear. Mm. And always on a Sunday morning, when you got up, Sunday morning, epsom salts. A little, enough to cover a silver threepenny bit, in a saucer and some tea on it, and you just had to take it, drink it. To keep your bowels right. And as I was saying about all this, you're saying What did my Mother do to eke it out? Eke the food out? She used to go to the butchers and get breast of lamb, scrag-end, sheep's head, pig's head. And if she got half a pig's head she used to cut the pig's head in half and used to use the top half, and that was where the ears was, and everything, boil it until all all the meat dropped off and then she used to put in er a big basin, scrumple it up in her fingers, put some of the juice in, and put a seven pound weight on it, and a saucer, and make brawn. Now the bottom half,th it's j jaw, you used to boil that and make chap of it, pig's chap, and that was a luxury. Beautiful. You don't s see it today, but's it's beautiful. What is it? Pig's chap, it's a pig's pig's jaw, the bottom jaw. Th this part here. Cheek? Y yeah. Mm. Pig's cheek. But it's called pig's chap,in those days . . And on a S Monday, it were always killing day at the Co-op, always killing day. Then on a Tuesday, they used to make the black puddings, the plonney the scratchings, the potted meat, and they used to come on sale. You used to see all the scratchings and all stu steaming hot, with the black puddings and the plonney shining like silver sixpences. And the pork dripping, beef dripping. Oh yes, it  was marvellous, that's how they used to make it, in those days. Then they You dropped the old er breasts of lamb in the old stew pot, chop it up, and then if there was any left, me Mam used to take it out, so we could eat it cold. Beautiful s er breast of lamb is, if you've never tried it, my duck. Get a breast of lamb. Get your butcher to bone it, make a nice stuffing, roll it up, wrap it in a nice bit of tinfoil, stick it in the oven and you've got a beautiful meal, me darling. Or the old roast brisket. Brisket. You used to do the old brisket, in the saucepans, along with the potherbs and so forth. Pearl barley, you don't hear pearl barley now. By God, it was a must in those days, pearl barley. Y \\nWhat was it used for? With cooking, like rice. And we used to put it in stews. You put it in stews, my duck. Oh yes, and er of course mostly, in these outlying districts, you mostly grew your own vegetables. And it was always a ritual for the gardeners to have new potatoes and peas ready for Wake Sunday. When's that? That was the last Saturday in July, the nearest Saturday to St Peter's. And we always have used to have that on a Wake Sunday. New potatoes, home grown new potatoes. And s i if you were lucky, some ham. Then on a Sunday night, the village, what they call wakes, they call them wakes in those days, not the village fair, it was the wakes. Mr  used to open up his dragons and start his steam engine and driving the organ, and he used to give an organ recital every wakes' Sunday night for the  cot fund. Cos we used to have support so many cots in the children's hospital, and we used to run concerts. Mr Len , well known man. was running all this for the Ruddington cot funds. .was the fire brigade chief, was a newspaper man , and this was how we ran in this village. We ran all sorts of little things, see? And it was a very friendly little village. My mother, apart from being a skivvying, she used to go out with along with Mrs , doing the hatched, matched and dispatched department. Now, do you know what that is? Well, that's the births, marriages and deaths. And if anybody was sick, in those days, and they were nearly dying, we used to sit up with them, night after night. And if they died, we us I  helping my moni my Mother many at time, to wash them down, before they put them in the coffins. Put the false teeth in, and the pennies in the eyes, and and that sort of thing.\",\n",
       " \"Did she get paid for doing that ? Aye. And then you'd send for Mr , the undertaker, or Mr , and he'd come along and measure and then make your coffin. I've got my Mother's bill here, I'll show it you. That was what, that was nineteen twenty eight, when I started work and I worked for  and M.\\n,House, Road. And er I used to get se seven and sixpence a week, seven and sixpence a week. And of course I wa I was due to learn the trade, I wasn't an apprentice. I was due to learn the trade from start to finish with the with the idea of getting myself up to getting on the road. So I started as an errand boy and half a crown a week was my bus fare, which give me, entitled me two journeys, a return journey each day. From  to Nottingham ? From  , it was fourpence, return. Or if you wanted to go home for your dinner and go back again in the afternoon, well, that was four and sixpence, which entitled you to do a Saturday journey. And you used to have a little ticket, with the days on, and they used to punch it with the old, you remember the old punching machines, don't you? Well they used to punch your ticket, with a little hole in, so that they'd know you'd had your journey. Now as I say, I started at that price and I used to have to help in the warehouse, in the packing and so forth, and then if there was any parcels to go into Nottingham I used to have to deliver them, by hand. And carry them, either carry them, or push them on a two-wheeled trolley, all through the round the lace market to  's, and various other And if I were lucky, and the  's van was going round the lace market, and I'd got three or four parcels, I used to go with little Tommy and his horse and van, round the lace market, and he was delivering dress goods then. And then he used to pick the undress goods up to go to G and W  's, still down  Road. See? And er of course, as years went by I got to a to be on the invoicing side, after that. So you? That was an office job was it ? Yeah. That was making the invoices out for the parcel. Oh, and then I went u started as a packer after that, packing, which was an art, in those days. H we had to pack hampers, and so forth, see? And big parcels. And then I went on invoicing. And then from invoicing, I went into the factory, of course, to learn how the goods were made, which was very interesting. You see the i it was er we used to make curtains then for Littlewoods, Littlewoods as it is now, they're still, you know, the they were about the  forerunners   of the er tt this er catalogue business, and if they gave us an order that would last us a long time, and that usually the eight points, which was meant to say there were eight threads to an inch. That's how you measured curtains in the quality of the curtains was so many points to an inch. The more points to an inch, the finer the goods were, you see? If it was just a six point, or a seven point, then it was a real coarse one, cheap, for American markets. But we used to Littlewoods used to give us an order, for one machine, or two machines, and you could keep your machine on this one particular set of curtains, without changing your jacks, without changing your beams, without changing your bodies, you could work straight on and on and on. Well, they used to do them at fourpence ha'penny a pair, and each one must be put in a big envelope, so as it could go out on this catalogue business. And that sort of stuff used to go to America, because in er we had quite a big American market in those days because they didn't wash curtains in America, they used to put them up until they dar until they dropped down and then put new curtains up, you see? And er  we er tt  we er  we made er a lot of blackout stuff during the war, we had they called the Federation of British Industries, which was an annual fair at Birmingham, and my firm used to s used to exhibit there. Bu and er  of course, most of your work was done from these Federation stores, stalls, Birmingham and London. And I recall at the beginning of the war,they got a an almost light-proof black out curtaining, and I can re see it today, The Queen bought some, they were on exhibition. Buckingham Palace I should say, not the Queen, but Buckingham Palace bought some. And I can remember tenneyex telex coming through and we did our own er er signs in those days, you know, er advertising placards, it was red hot on the press. Blackout curtaining, as bought by Buckingham Palace. And of course, you couldn't keep pace with it, because Buckingham Palace had bought it you see, and it was good. What were these blackout curtains made of, then? Well it was er, a dense, thick, curtain, so dense that it was hardly visible, because in those days, during the first world war, during the thirty nine forty five war, blackout was essential. You can't remember the blackout, can you? You see the idea, was if you had lights in your house and there was just a kink, or chink, they used to call them in those days, they could be spotted from the air, so th You either had wooden shutters at your window, or blackout curtaining. You weren't allowed to show any lights. Even the, what few bits of lorries were on the road, they had a special mask on with er a shield over the top, so that the light wasn't visible up above. Cos, probably you don't realize that, even a cigarette light,if you drew a cigarette, like that, and er and made it glow, it's visible for quite a few hundred yards in the darkness. And consequently we was all subject, and you were fined very heavily if you were, if you tore these what's- a-names, blackouts, that's the name. And then of course, we we also made the, at my firm, made the er Battle of Britain curtain, which was very famous, in those days, and I think they're still I used to have one but I don't know where the devil it went to. Cos it, most of the things got lost during the war, you know? Dra \\nThat was the \\n\\nthe participants for H Two will have already discovered, we are still tackling part of H One from yesterday, but, and I apologize that you will have to sit through the outstanding items of discussion. On the other hand, you will have gathered already that we are going to talk about Greater York, so I think there may be some distinct benefit and merit in you being he here to listen to that, er particular part of the topic, now the, I hope in fact that we can deal with the remainder of H One, because it it does lead quite logically into the next issue which we want to talk about, which is the new settlement in the Greater York area, er and I hope that we can get through this item by our morning break, that but whenever we do conclude on H One we will have to have a slightly longer break just to enable the seating arrangements to be sorted out properly for all participants who are involved in the discussion on the new settlement. Now can I er also suggest to you that in discussing this one outstanding item of the housing land allocations, we pursue virtually the same sort of approach that we did yesterday, er and in fact if you look at what is set down under matter One D for discussion, it says is the provision proposed for the Greater York area including the new settlement appropriate etcetera, and in fact when you look at the first item for discussion under the Greater York new settlement issue, we come straight into, does Greater York new settlement represent an appropriate and justified policy response, etcetera. So what I'm going to ask effectively that when we are talking about the Greater York element of the housing land allocation we concentrate on the question of is the level of provision enough? And we know there are various er responses to that question, and I would be looking to the districts to say whether or not they could cope with the various levels of provision that have been identified for Greater York, and it's the view of whether they can cope within their own districts, I haven't said how you can cope, I said whether you can cope, you might I will I will leave you free to make the odd comment, but I want to focus on that part of the issue, and then the natural corollary to that is, will it be necessary, or is it considered necessary in the context of this alteration to provide specific guidance within H One policy for the distribution of that er development to er at sub, what I would call sub-district level, in other words do you want a specific entry for say Ryedale or Hambledon? Has anyone got any questions on that approach? Is it clear how I'd like to play it? Er so with no more ado I will ask Mr Davis for North Yorkshire to present his opening statement, and then I'd like Mr Curtis, your moment has come Mr Curtis, er to to follow on from Mr Davis. Thank you. Peter Davis, North Yorkshire County Council, erm I'd just like to make five brief points in response to the issues that have been raised erm on One D.\\nThe first of those points is the principle of a Greater York dimension to the structure plan, erm we'll all probably be aware that in the original structure plan the Secretary of State wasn't prepared to accept a Greater York dimension in the structure plan, but did accept with the support of the district councils on the first alteration, the inclusion of a Greater York dimension. Having that Greater York dimension has certainly allowed progress to be achieved dramatically in Greater York, erm, it's led to progress towards progress towards green belt definition, and more importantly it's led towards resolution of future strategy for Greater York. Er we at the County Council think that to delete that Greater York erm dimension would take us back to the realms of uncertainty, past uncertainty, in the Greater York area, we're therefore proceeding with a Greater York dimension in policy H One at none thousand seven hundred dwellings, which equates to hundred percent migration. The second point I want to raise is the issue erm of the green belt, er which is er a constraint in Greater York erm we've made significant progress in moving towards the statutory definition of the green belt, the green belt local plan has now completed erm its public enquiry, and a lot of the deliberations in Greater York have centred around the effect on of the green belt on development potential in Greater York, so that is a main issue, I think, in response to issues, the discussion of issues in Greater York. The third point which has come out in a number erm of comments, certainly from the C P R E is the issue of overshoots in the approved structure plan in respect to Greater York, and as we made clear in paragraph eight of our er erm position statement, we accept that there has been in numeric terms in the period eighty one to ninety two something like fifteen percent overshoot in terms of completions er in that period. We would wish to stress again, with the district council's support I suspect, that that overshoot really it's to sites within the urban area, as in windfall sites in general planning terms we have seen to be acceptable er in planning terms, but we would wish to stress that part part of that approach has been a continuing resistance to development on greenfield sites on the edge of the the urban area. The fourth point, Chairman, er is the new settlement issue, and while that's due for discussion on policy H Two, that issue does shall I suggest invade policy H One, because an appropriate form of words has to be agreed in policy H One to reflect the new settlement issue and as you'll be aware the County Council is about a step by step approach towards the finalization of the new settlement erm strategy for Greater York, and then finally, a specific issue that you mentioned is the distribution of developments between the Greater York districts er within Greater York, now as you'll be aware Chairman, that has been done informally, following the original structure plan in nineteen eighty the County and the Districts got together and agreed the distribution of housing and employment land in Greater York. Following the first alteration, when the Secretary of State approved the Greater York dimension, that matter was resolved amicably between the County and the Districts erm through the er Greater York study, so the issue therefore is there a need for more guidance for the structure plan, to break down the Greater York figure to individual Greater York districts, and our view quite clearly er is the answer that the answer to that is no. Certainly it would be very difficult to introduce any statistical rational erm to the desegregation of Greater York to its district components, bearing in mind the small populations er in some of the Greater York er districts, we think that the general level of detail erm in the structure plan is appropriate, and we think to go down to any finer detail would be an inappropriate to a structure plan, and thirdly I think on that issue, er we would think that it would prejudice erm the work that District Council would want to do erm in their er local plans. So those, Chairman, are the five points er that I wanted to raise on Greater York, and obviously we will be interested to hear the response round the table today. Can I ask Mr can I ask Mr Davis to give us a bit more explanation, please, as to his rationale behind continuing resistance to the development of greenfield sites on the edge of York. Peter Davis, North Yorkshire County Council, erm I think the clear answer to that is that districts, erm and county, erm were very aware of the greenbelt constraints on greenbelt sites\\nBut\\nerm adjacent to the urban area. Are you saying that greenfield development on the edge of York would be in the greenbelt as you have  defined it in the deposited local plan. I'm talking about the the overshoot, and my comments about greenfield sites were related to period eighty one to ninety two, and it became quite clear during the eighties that the sketch plan green belt or development was at that time, through the eighties, was by and large abutting onto the urban area, that er through the eighties what everybody understood to the sketch plan green belt was tight up against er the urban area, so in resisting urban greenfield sites erm on the urban edge through the eighties the County Council were recognizing the greenbelt constraints. That isn't quite the question I asked. Unless you are telling me that the sketch greenbelt local plan is the same as the deposited greenbelt local plan\\nWell\\nis there land between the current edge of development in York and the inner edge of the greenbelt which is as yet undeveloped? Yes, and then that approach was taken on through the Greater York study, and in the greenbelt local plan, and the Greater York study identified a number of sites. Part A goes ninety one to ninety six, part B ninety six to two thousand and six, sites adjacent to the urban area in the Greater York study er which were acceptable for development because corporately the districts and the county did not think that those sites discharged a greenbelt function as the greenbelt local plan was progressed those sites were excluded from the greenbelt erm and yes, we did identify a number of sites which did not conflict with greenbelt objectives erm on the urban edge. Are those sites within the City of York administrative area or other districts? The the bulk of them erm I think almost without exception are erm in adjoining districts, around York, the significant contribution from York that we identified in the Greater York study, erm largely comes from from windfill windfall sites, by and large. Which districts, please. Erm the the bulk of the erm erm commitment erm or the or the sites that we identified, er would be in would be in Ryedale district, in South Ryedale .\",\n",
       " \"Thank you, thank you. Mr Curtis. Thank you Chair. David Curtis, York City Council. I think some of my er introductory comments might now be  inspector, er understand the er sort of urban situation, erm we heard yesterday about er discussion about the similarities between different districts in North Yorkshire and the possible differences. I think everyone around the table would accept that in this situation York is unique. York's a historic city of some hundred and four thousand people, covering some two thousand nine hundred hectares, but that city itself is only part of the settlement that I think we would all regard as as York itself, that covers a larger population of some a hundred and thirty five thousand people, er contained er within the York outer ring road, and referenced to the the map submitted with my H One submission, and also the greenbelt plan which we've we've just put up on the board there, er will show you the the broader extent of the urban area. Clearly in that situation the city of York is highly constrained, it's a modern industrial city with a very tight medieval core, a historic core which is is world renowned, but a historic core which actually only covers four percent of the built area of the city itself, when we look at that wider area erm the central historic core together with the eight other conservation areas in the city and conservation areas in the remainder of the urban settlement comes to some thirteen percent of the urban area. Furthermore we have a series of major landscape features, er which are been referred to in the greenbelt local plan and elsewhere as wedges, which you'll see from the map enter into the very heart of the city itself. Some six hundred hectares of that land is actually designated as greenbelt, but in addition within that a number of those areas are er prevented from development in perpetuity we'd argue because a large part of that area has got a historic status as stray land, which is a form of common land, which means it's actually not not available for any form of development, similarly the flood planes of the river Ouse in particular is for physical development reasons er prevented from development in many areas, and those of you who were here this weekend will have no noticed the reason why, it was a flooding that took that took place on the Ouse valley, in addition to those constraints, open space within the city is at a premium erm the city falls below the Emperface standard, erm by er something like erm half a hectare per thousand population, so compared with the Emperface standard of two point four per thousand, the city reaches a quite a generous erm categorization of the recreational space we have available, only a total of two hectares per thousand, therefore, and this is very relevant to the Greater York debate, erm, really the only land for development within the city is recycled land, there are limited number of er sites which have not been developed in recent years erm which can be identified for development, and are being identified for development in our draft local plan. But the majority of of any development land in the city would be recycled, either from housing uses or industrial uses. The draft of the city wide local plan will be going to the city council in December, and  prove of the consultation, but the figures some of you've seen in our evidence have been a agreed by the the local plan steering group, who sit in council members er across party, committee which has agreed the basic numbers, so the draft allocations which are in our submission, and which we have seen in the  schedules yesterday, are accepted as a basis for consultation by the city council but are clearly subject to review. Turn turning then to just touch on the issues that I've, we didn't cover yesterday for York, erm you'll notice from our H One submission we have a slight difference of opinion with the County Council on the technical side of the er the calculation, we believe that the calculation, we believe that the calculation for York's need rather than three three should be a four thousand figure, taking into account the the issue of concealed households and involuntary sharing. However, that doesn't have an effect on our er ability to agree a figure of three three for the city itself, in the structure plan, because the work we've done on the local plan taking into account commitments and suitable allowances for small sites, does indicate to us that a figure of three three is achievable, but would be extremely difficult to exceed, the difference here between the four thousand and the three three does, however, have an impact on our neighbours clearly, and as was mentioned yesterday the City Council does own some some twenty nine hectares of land outside its current boundary, er located in the Ryedale District Council area, that land, some of that land has planning consent, the remainder is allocated in the draft Southern Ryedale local plan and was excluded from the greenbelt, that land it is the City Council's intention to use to meet its er requirements for affordable housing, could accommodate some seven hundred dwellings, I think it is very important for me to emphasize that that is a very clear commitment of the City Council, and therefore that land in Ryedale would not er in the majority of its case be available for open market use, we would be seeking to use it to meet er affordable housing requirements. Er the other point I would make about the the figures under H One, really is that erm the twelve thirty figures that you've seen in the tables is our best estimate at the present time, based on the site survey we've carried out. That is a very comprehensive survey, erm I wouldn't envisage any additional sites being recommended by the City Council, er at the present time, although clearly some of the sites may be suggested by by a private developers and landowners during the consultation process. It is quite possible clearly that that number could be reduced, during the consultation process on the on the local plan, I think that's an important point because of the issue of windfall that was mentioned by Mr Davis, and was raised yesterday, reference to historic trends in the city of York do show that erm we have exceeded structure plan targets by substantial amounts, I think the figure is is forty percent or or more, er the County Council could confirm that, slightly difficult calculation to do because I'm sure you'll be aware that to our eternal shame, the City Council has not to date adopted a formal local plan, with reference erm to your question on day one er as to whether or not we might calculate contribution of windfalls in the past, we have looked at the nineteen eighty seven residential land availability er study, which was agreed with the house builders, adjacent districts, and of course the County, and in the five year period of that study, by comparison with the sites that we agreed in the study, an additional four hundred and thirty dwellings came forward and were completed on sites that had not been identified in the study, now I'd I would say very clearly that that level of windfalls erm would not continue in the future and it could not be a reliable basis for erm looking at windfall contributions in the city in the future, clearly the supply of development land in the city is a is a finite resource, er given given the constraints that are current holding, and although some additional windfalls to the two hundred I'd suggested in my H One  may come forward, on the other hand I suspect some of the sites suggested in the draft local plan could fall out of the equation. Just turning briefly to the issue of affordable housing, you'll see from my H One submissions the City Council has a target, er which is in the the York area housing strategy, which is currently with the D O E for its consideration, of something like a hundred and fifty dwellings a year, giving over the fifteen year period a two thousand two hundred target, how we will go about achieving that is primarily, where it's possible using land we already own, or is in ownership of housing associations, and taking into account the the seven dwellings outside the current city boundary, we believe in total they will contribute some fifteen hundred dwellings towards that two thousand two hundred target, this will leave clearly a significant shortfall, and it will therefore be necessary to to seek to negotiate, if I can use the terms of P B G 3 erm with house builders as sites come forward in in the local during the local plan period. Turning now very briefly to the H One D the Greater York issue, clearly the comments I've made about the calculations for York have a knock on effect for our position on Greater York, the Greater York figures as I understand it from the County Council are based on a one hundred percent migration assumption, if the technical difference between us er we are right then we believe clearly the Greater York figure should be increased by an appropriate amount, and the we've suggested the increased cut should be seven hundred er relating to the city itself I can't calculate with any great accuracy what the figure for the surrounding parts of Greater York might be, but it would be we suspect only another one to two hundred more on top of that, therefore that underst explains the reason why the City Council suggests that the Greater York should be increased to the ten four figure from the nine seven. The other concern in the City Council's evidence on H One er is this issue of distribution, I note Mr Davis's comments about the difficulties of subdividing the Greater York allocation between different districts, and I I do acknowledge the difficulty in relation to Harrogate, and particularly Hambledon which obviously has a very small proportion of Greater York, on the other hand both Ryedale and Selby do contain a substantial proportion of the Greater York population, er based on my calculations of their er proportion of the population of Greater York which admittedly is a somewhat crude way of of doing estimates, but in the absence of of any other projections that was really the only way to do it, my estimate is that the er compared with the nine seven target of County Council would take in the could potentially be seen to be taking a share of four thousand two hundred in Ryedale and seventeen hundred for Selby, if you base it on their existing population distribution on er part  outside the city, now I'm not saying necessarily that's how the way you would do it, but I I think it's an indication that the scale of development in those two districts is quite significant in Greater York, our concern is that the policy as it currently stands does not give any real guidance as to the way in which distribution of development outside the city, but in Greater York, erm can be er should be di divided up, and I think the problem really occurs from the introduction of the new settlement into H One, erm I don't want to stray into the H Two debate  Chair, but I think it's the fact that H One does include a figure for the new settlement, that the new settlement is not located within any particular district, but that all the district totals do include in effect a figure which is undetermined at this stage, that that would be absorbed by the new settlement, as I understand the policy at the moment, and I think that really does introduce a problem, erm because clearly all of the emerging districts wide local plans could be in conformity with the structure plan and not include the new settlement, I think it's er interesting to note that the the D O E's recently published a good practice guide, on development plans, did particularly highlight the situation in Greater York, as a problem, as a shortcoming of the existing plan, and if I can just quote it, it does say this, on page forty three, it would seem appropriate for broad locations of new development to be established by means of an alteration to the structure plan. So we have suggested, erm, you will see in our evidence that policy H One should be amended and their are clearly a number of ways in which that amended amendment could take place, but we would particularly suggest that erm an indication should be given as to what the proportion of each district's allocation is assumed to be going to the new settlement, if the new settlement is is agreed under the H Two discussion, thank you. Thank you very much, Mr Curtis. I mean effectively what you're saying is that York has got a capacity for about another three thousand three hundred dwellings? Yes. Over a whole range of sites. After \\nYes. that you're really straining, almost to get a gallon into a pint pot, never mind a quart, aren't you? David Curtis, York City Council. Yes, that is correct, sir. Does that include all land within the city boundary not included in the greenbelt? Yes. David Curtis, York City Council. Yes it does, the there is as you will see from the greenbelt plan,a apart from the issue of the fact that the the city boundary is in many areas er sort of hard up against further urban development so there's no space between the city and the parts in adjacent districts, the greenbelt boundary, as currently proposed by the County Council, erm which as you'll see from our evidence is not a boundary supported in its entirety by the City Council, means there is no further development land between the city boundary and the greenbelt. Thank you. Thank you. I think I'll ask Mr Smith from Ryedale to  tell us a little more about Ryedale's problems or efforts\\nThank you. to cope with the pressures from York city itself, and the Greater York area. Ian Smith, Ryedale District. Erm Ryedale District, as can be seen from the table supplied by Greater York, has taken the largest proportion of the Greater York housing element over the past ten years, as regards the proposed level of future housing growth suggested for the Greater York area, the District Council supports the figure in the structure plan, the Greater York study identified a number of sites around the Greater York area which could accommodate further development without compromising greenbelt objectives or adversely affecting the character of the settlements surrounding York, and within that part of Southern Ryedale within the Greater York area the identified sites were, by and large, incorporated into the Southern Ryedale local plan, which has recently been through the public enquiry, the District Council does not believe that a larger amount of land could be identified within Southern Ryedale, without compromising greenbelt objectives. As regards the distribution of lands between the districts, erm if I can refer to Mr Curtis's comments first, the Greater York study never anticipated that the distribution of housing around the Greater York the districts would be based around the percentage of population within those districts, but purely on capacity of sites within those districts to accommodate future housing growth without compromising greenbelt objectives, Ryedale, as I've said before, has taken the largest proportion of recent housing in the Greater York area, and has identified a substantial amount of new land for housing within its Southern Ryedale local plan, what the District Council is concerned about is that within the local, Southern Ryedale local plans, this is taking a large proportion of its district wide total plans, yet the District Council from the structure plan figure given is unable to calculate the remainder of housing that should be allocated in the remainder of its district. What Ryedale is seeking is not a figure for its sector within the Greater York area, and the same with the other districts, but rather a figure for the Greater York area as a whole, and then a figure for the remainder of those parts of the districts outside the Greater York area, so you don't get a situation with my colleagues on the left where you are in the structure plan dictating the number of houses that should be allocated in, for example, two parishes. I follow the I follow the er the point, but the thing that puzzles me is that your South Ryedale local plan allocations have arisen out of the discussions on the Greater York study, yes? That is correct, yes. Where do you go post two thousand and six, for example, in obtaining a strategic view about the distribution of growth around York, and in the Greater York area. I mean, how is that going to be provided? How are you going to be given, and I'm making an assumption, of course that the present two tier planning system is still prevailing? Stick with that scenario, how, how would you anticipate, or how would you expect that strategic guidance to be given as to where development should be appropriately located to serve the needs of Greater York, what mechanism is there in place for being \\nI it's \\ngiven that guidance? Ian Smith, Ryedale District Council. Erm beyond two thousand and six, I would have thought the strategic guidance would be in locations other than peripheral expansion around the Greater York area, which I would have suggested would would more than likely be to new settlements. Can I pursue  erm any fact no more without compromising greenbelt objectives, no more than that, er you said a couple of times. I th I'm not challenging that, I simply wish to be clear what you mean by it. Two questions. Does that mean no more without development in the deposited greenbelt, as in the greenbelt as defined in the deposited greenbelt local plan, or does it mean no more unless it is hard up against that greenbelt? And secondly, to which greenbelt objectives did you refer? Ian Smith, Ryedale District Council. Er to answer the first answer the first of your two questions, erm, the greenbelt as defined in the greenbelt local plan is hard up, in many respects, against the edge of the built up area, excluding allocated sites, allocations above that within the Southern Ryedale area would in fact require redrawing green in a green belt boundaries. But there is allocated land, allocated undeveloped land, between the existing urban edge and the inner edge of the greenbelt? Yes, where, sorry, Ian Smith, Ryedale District, yes, er where it was considered those allocated sites could be developed without extending development into the greenbelt.\",\n",
       " 'Thank you. Mr Davis, and then Mr  .',\n",
       " \"I'm sorry there was a second question . Oh sorry, yes. Erm the greenbelt objectives which we identify with or could be compromised by significant peripheral expansion, or the expansion of a settlement within the greenbelt, were primarily the effecting the setting of the historic city, which we and the County considered and refer to more than just the green wedges, and but involve the whole countryside, and the setting of the settlements within the greenbelt around the Greater York area, expansion of lar large urban areas into the countryside, possible coalescence of settlements. Not the historic city itself? Yes er  it the first, yes, setting of the historic city . How would you describe the setting of the historic core of York. Erm, it's a city,this takes me back a few months, since the Southern Ryedale local plan enquiry, the character, special character of a city, is derives from a number of elements, there's the green wedges which centre on the strays which penetrate into the heart of the built up area, there is the encircling belt of open countryside which links those areas together, there are the numerous settlements within the greenbelt and their relationship to one another, and to the city of York. There are a number of viewpoints of the city from the ring road\\nYes. erm, in some of which the Minster is clearly visible,\\nMhm. in a setting of suburban, industrial, residential development, and some of those viewpoints on the ring road all one can see is the suburban, industrial, and residential development. Ian Smith,Ry \\nThat's what were aiming to preserve, is it? Well, Ian Smith Ryedale, I think in the majority of views across from the ring road you have a belt of open countryside before that suburban housing. What you yo were trying to achieve is the expansion of the built up area towards the ring road, and thereby having built development hard up er as it is at the moment the ring road goes through for the most part open countryside on either side of it.\",\n",
       " 'Yes.',\n",
       " \"Thank you. Mr Davis. Very briefly, Peter Davis, North Yorkshire County Council, you raised the issue of procedures looking at the er post two thousand and six scenario within the light of er a statutory greenbelt er at that time, and I would envisage that the County Council and the Districts, if indeed we're all er in business at er er in in in the next century, would probably want to run a similar sort of exercise that they  would be ran through the end of the eighties, and that is to sit down together, er and look at all the options, er that are available for Greater York, in the same way that they did it in ninety eighty nine, one additional factor at that time would be that er the greenbelt would be statutory, and it would be statutory if the County Council and ninety five percent of the district support on sites would be a tight greenbelt so the options would be looked at erm er in that context, on the comments that er Miss Whittaker, erm questions that Miss Whittaker raised, there is a paper that the County Council produced for the greenbelt local plan enquiry that I remember well as N Y Two, which set out in detail the various components, erm of the York greenbelt in addition to the historic title that the that the focus of the green belt comes across a variety of of of of matters, and if it if it is helpful to this panel that document was acceptable by and large, supported by the District, we can certainly put that in, and can circulate it round.\",\n",
       " 'Yes, yes please, if you would. Thank you, sir. Mr Grigson. Steven Grigson from Barton Willmore. Sir, I would want to come back I susp \\nCan you? I will want to come back, I suspect later on.',\n",
       " \"Am I on? Thank you. I want to make a limited point at this juncture, I reserve the right to come back later on, and it's become three points as a result of the discussion we've already had, my view on the contribution of the of the greenbelt to the York issue isn't just the setting of the city, it's the character of the city, and that would include the central city and the historic city, and the need to limit the physical expansion and size of the urban area because of the implications inside the historic city, and that would certainly apply to other cities with greenbelts that I'm familiar with like York, like er Oxford, which the character suffers from expansion, possibly excessive, Norwich, that considered a greenbelt, and London, if you like that didn't get its greenbelt until we had the character rather drastically altered, so I think it isn't just the setting and how you see the city from the ring road, it's actually what happens inside the core, the second point I want to make is really for clarification perhaps, er and it relates to the question of allocations between the built up area and the inner edge of the  greenbelt, as I understand it all those allocations are already er included in the Ryedale local plan, and are already therefore included in the commitments that we looked at in Ryedale, I don't think there is a further reserve of spare opportunities that might be used either before or after two thousand and six, that's certainly my understanding and if anybody was was taking a different view I think that should be clear, and now I come to the one point that I was actually going to raise, erm I think it's important that in this discussion of the relations between York city and Greater York, that we get a, early on, a clear view of what the requirements are in York, not just its capacity which we've discussed so far, and a figure of three thousand three hundred seems to be a fairly common currency, but its requirements, and I want to address a particular question to the County Council, which is in my proof, so they've had as it were four weeks notice of it. And that is that in the projections of housing requirements for the City of York, not Greater York but the City of York, the County Council have a figure of four thousand four hundred households extra, but propose a provision of only three thousand three hundred dwellings extra, that's purely within York, and the question really therefore for the County Council is I had thought that their dwelling requirements, that their, sorry their their policy H One figure for York was what they thought the requirements were, but maybe it's what they think the limited capacity is, and they are foreseeing an overspill of thousand odd from the city of York into Greater York. Mr Spittle. Malcolm Spittle  the figures in policy H One are quite clearly referred to as provision that will be made in particular settlements, they are not stated as the the requirement for dwellings generated by that particular settlement, erm, that is quite clearly set out in policy H One, that is the wording of the policy. If the city cannot provide mo , physically more than three thousand three hundred it would not be wise to include a figure of four thousand, five thousand, six thousand, dwellings within the city, that would be misleading and would not provide clear guidance to any local authority in the preparation of their local plan. I don't think that was the point Mr Grigson was making. Well the \\nfor clarity is that the actual projected requirements, as a series of projections produced by County Council are for four thousand three hundred households, and a projected requirement for three thousand three hundred dwellings, well quite clearly if the City of York itself cannot accommodate the requirement generated from in that city, then it must be looked at in relation to the whole of the Greater York area, and the projections of the Greater York area do take into account the er the figures generated from within the City of York, therefore, yes, they are included within the Greater York figure. Do you accept, Mr Spittle, as Mr Grigson says, the projected on a tr on a trend statistical projection, the figure of households for York city is four thousand four hundred? The figure I think that we, yes I wonder if Mrs Long could re  to that particular question ? Yes. Mrs Long, North Yorkshire County Council. Wait a minute, pull the microphone towards you. Mrs Long, North Yorkshire County Council. I did the demographic projections, erm, I think the difference that, er, Mr Grigson is talking about between dwellings and households comes about within the ability of the Chelmer model to input, erm, tt, calculated dwelling requirements. Now I did it in one method and Mr Grigson did it in er in a second method, and the ability to do that changes the number of households that it would project to the er the dwellings, and cancels out, this makes judgements erm on the actual population projections based, which are estimates that have come out, I don't necessarily believe the best measured estimates have come out for York, and have adjusted some of the figures in accordance with that. Now I'd like to emphasize this as because within York area it saw a difference between the census counts to the actual base population of a growth of five point seven two percent. This is more than the change that inner London received, and I think it's quite unbelievable that York's population, base population is actually starting of from the figure of er a hundred and three, a hundred and four thousand, and I think York City Council will agree with that in any case, erm, the new major estimates for nineteen ninety two would already suggest that that population's declined by a further thousand, which I think emphasizes that these major estimates are estimates, and because of the differ the difficulties within the census for nineteen ninety one, with under enumeration, some problems may have occurred. Erm, so I'll agree with Mr Grigson that we do suggest there are more households changing their own dwellings, but it's simply because we're trying to iron out of the problems that we feel have occurred within the major estimates. What's your projection for the city? In terms of additional households, ninety one, two thousand and six, please. Erm, just one moment please  four thousand two hundred. Four? Four thousand two hundred. Thank you. Mr Grigson, is that moving in the direction which you wished to get an answer to your question? Well it, it, it, it's moving a bit in that direction, I mean I knew what their prediction was cos they kindly supplied it to me, which is why I made the point, but I mean as as you know from our proof we have a higher view of the demographic requirements in York even than that, for reasons that were amply discussed in general on on day one, to do with vacant dwellings, mortality, and I think still probably a difference in migration between us on York, which is statistical rather than environmental, but I think it is important to to have that established early on that that even in the County Council's view, and with their, as it were, doubts about the statistics which they themselves use, that er there is more need generated in York, however much it is, than York itself can accommodate, and that is of course without York city's seven hundred addition for reducing concealed and sharing households which is not in the County Council's figures. Yes, er  I see from the supplementary proof which you have put in the other day, I mean your calculations of York's requirements is six thousand six hundred.\",\n",
       " \"Yes. Yes. Yes. No doubt we will return to that. Mr Donson. Thank you. Roy Donson, House Builders' Federation. I'd like to take up some points as they've occurred this morning. Erm, the first point relates to erm affordable housing targets in York, and the consequences that that has in relation not only to York but other areas, on the on the assumption that that there is, there has to be an overspill to to adjou adjacent areas. Erm, I heard Mr Curtis say that the shortfall of affordable houses was seven hundred, he had a target of two thousand two hundred and felt they could find fifteen hundred somewhere already, so another shortfall of of seven hundred  that actually contrasts with para' four one one of the one eleven should I say, four one eleven, of the York housing strategy, which has been submitted, and appendix four of the York evidence which actually says that, yes there's a two thousand two hundred target, but there would still be a shortfall of about one thousand one hundred dwellings if this land, they're talking about land that they own outside of York, is developed for affordable housing. Well there seems to be a slight mismatch there, and perhaps some of this mismatch is also a part of, with the confusion I have of the various shifting policy of York, in term in terms of their requirement, there has been in the in the not too recent recent past York were saying they had an additional requirement beyond need which they termed their concealed requirement, although it might not be a concealed dwellings, as we might otherwise describe them, of one thousand six hundred, and that has progressively come down to seven hundred as presented at this enquiry. Now it seemed to me that one thousand six hundred was  initially as a result of survey work or shall we say investigation into the housing waiting list carried out by the York housing department, and I have to say that I have a certain respect for the York housing department, and they have a certain reasonable and good reputation within the region as a housing department, and so there seems to me that there is a gr a there is a potential to underestimate er the the affordable requirement that's been put to you, another point erm I'd just like perhaps to seek a little clarification from Mr Curtis, was was unfortunately I was looking something else up or my attention was diverted when he gave some figures for Ryedale and Selby, I think he said, and I'll happily stand corrected on this, that if you take away the York requirement figure from his ten thousand four hundred for Greater York, then the remainder he would apportion to Selby and Ryedale, so that Selby got four thousand two hundred, sorry, so that Ryedale got four thousand two hundred and Selby got one thousand seven hundred, erm that doesn't add up to ten thousand four hundred and I I I in total, and I I wondered where the rest was coming from, if I  the point correctly. My note indicates that what Mr Curtis said was that on a pro rata to their existing \\nYes. population levels i in the area of Greater York, an allocation would suggest that, he wasn't advocating that, it was just a pro rata ball park estimate, and he didn't purport to make it add up to the residual requirement  okay ? It's it's still one thousand two hundred dwellings short, and I don't know where there going to go.\",\n",
       " \"Mr Curtis. Thank you Chair. David Curtis, York City Council. There's a few issues I'd like to cover from a number of comments, I'll I'll \\nI'm sorry. You hadn't finished? No I hadn't. Alright,\\nhold your horses then Mr Curtis. to two points\\nYou can pick that\\nDo you want those picked up? No? Yes, my other points about Ryedale anyway. Er yes Chair, first of all the the last point first as it were, the erm Senior Inspector is quite correct what I was doing was allocating the nine seven figure that the County had proposed in H One, er that's why it doesn't add up add up to ten four, clearly I haven't done the calculations for ten four, but on the basis that erm there are seven hundred extra dwellings going into Ryedale, I think Mr Donson can work that one out. Erm in connection with erm with reference to the York area housing strategy, again, there is a simple explanation, in that that that document was prepared before the current work on the City of York draft local plan, had progressed to a stage at which members had considered housing sites, and a number of sites in City Council ownership erm within the city, covering some four hundred dwellings have now been agreed by the City Council members as coming forward over the planned period for affordable housing, and in the case of two of those sites it actually requires sites to be taken out of use as public car parks, to bring them forward for development, and that is why the eleven hundred figure is actually reduced now to to a seven hundred.\",\n",
       " 'Thank you.',\n",
       " \"Mr Donson, do you want to continue now? Er yes, thank you very much. Sorry, my my my other point is about about Ryedale, and and and its its and its its unde its relationship to Southern Ryedale, and erm Mr Smith said that erm as far as Ryedale Council are concerned they can't identify any more land within Southern Ryedale, well of course they would say that because was there position at the Southern Ryedale plan, but the fact of the matter is that there was a great dispute at the York greenbelt Southern Ryedale plan enquiry,revol resolving around the issue of what were the bits of the greenbelt which made up the historic character and thereby what were you left with that potentially could be developed, albeit it might be reserved as white land in the first place, but could potentially be developed, and a great deal of this land on the disputed side lay in Southern Ryedale, that in that in fact there was a view around the table not only sh not only shared by by the developers side, but erm that large parts of Osbaldwick and Huntingdon didn't fall within the definition of greenbelt as as set out by by the County Council in their N Y Two Two document, now that matter clearly has got to be something left to the Inspector and the Greenbelt Inquiry, but I think it's fair to point out that there is actually a difference of view, so it's not an absolute position, that you can't identify more land within within Southern Ryedale, and indeed, erm, not that I want to raise the Local Government Commission's head again, but of course the Local Government Commission is proposing that York be a unitary authority expanded, and once Yor , if York does become a unitary authority expanded then some of these areas will fall within their area, and they may have a different view than er the Ryedale current Ryedale district council does, and therefore I think it is a little unsafe to take just at pure se pure face value, that there is no more land within Southern Ryedale that could be developed. I think we live with the local authority set up as we have it. Mr Smith, erm, obviously you want to respond to that, but at the same time could I just press you towards your view and it's really relevant to the districts surrounding York, that we know you can live with the figures of provision as set out by the County Council in the alteration, how ar are you aware of the figures which are being proposed by other participants in the discussion for Greater York? Yes. You are? Could you comment on whether you could live with an expanded requirement, er in South Ryedale? And if you could, how would you see it being met? I suspect you've already made that answered that that question. Ian Smith, Ryedale District. Erm yea,i I'll come back on that a couple of points, erm regarding Mr Donson erm and the Southern Ryedale and York greenbelt local plan inquiry. The site that was identified or potentially identified by by the house builders in York was a site which both the County Council and the District Council considered performed a number of greenbelt functions, I think that it would be accepted that in any development plan land should only be allocated if there were some degree of certainty that it would come forward for development within the plan period, the site that was identified, there had been no objections made to the Southern Ryedale local plan so therefore there were no indications that it would have come forward for development within that plan period anyway, had it been identified, had it been allocated. Erm regarding the question of erm additional sites for housing, I erm if I can turn to erm Barton Willmore's  G One Ten erm in paragraph \\nCan I, can I just pause you there? Have you had a copy of, dare I say it, the tabulation which was produced by the panel, which summarized the various er submissions, and if I just read them to you. The H B F figure for Greater York was twelve thousand three hundred, the Barton Willmore figure was twelve thousand seven hundred, but they did break it down on a district basis, and they gave five six five o to Ryedale, and then Michael Courcier, represented by Mr Sedgewick, a much more modest figure of ten thousand six hundred, for Greater York. Ian Smith, Ryedale District. Erm, as I've said before, I have reservations about whether a much increased figure about above the County Council's er proposal could be accommodated within Ryedale District Council, and I if the figure above that is proposed I would suggest that the extra is accommodated within the new settlement, which I presume the ar argue answer you would have expected from Ryedale, erm Barton Willmore's figure is based on an assumption that they believe that within Ryedale there is a capacity to increase past building rates, I would refute that, erm the building rates in Southern Ryedale I would suggest were abnormally high, because of the development of Clifton Moor airfield, the North Western part of the Southern Ryedale district, sorry South Western part. The land there is now nearly exhausted, and I would suggest that building rates in future years are in fact likely to decrease from what were abnormally high figures in the in the past ten year period. Yep, er er yes. L coming back to your other point I mean your saying you could not physically, or you would not wish to accommodate, let me put it that way, you would not wish to accommodate anything more than is now you're you're making provision for within the South Ryedale local plan\\nIan Smith \\ncan I just just pursue that you said said so the if you embarked on another scenario, and you said that the only way in which extra over, that beyond the figure proposed by the County Council, would be by way of a new settlement, I'm sort of transgressing my own ground rules here, I know that Ryedale has expressed support for the principle of a new settlement, are you saying that you would be looking for a new settlement, possibly in Ryedale? Ian Smith, Ryedale District. We would be looking for a new settlement in the best location around Greater York. I thought you'd say that. Was that meaning yes or no? Yes we support the principle, but the question about whether or not it should be in Ryedale district has not been erm answered by our members, and indeed it it we consider it should have wait, I mean this is answering something that'll be discussed at later within this issue, something that should not be er assessed until after the er\\nWell, let's put it on the shelf for the time being. But I, we're going to have to discuss when we get to H Two just how you're going through the process of actually finding a site. If, you know, finding a site for a new settlement is an acceptable way forward, but I, let's leave it on the shelf for now.\",\n",
       " \"Mr Curtis. Thank you, Chair. Er David Curtis, York City Council. I'd just like to comment on two or three issues that were raised earlier. Clearly we do not wish to go through the same debate that we had at the greenbelt inquiry, erm but it is very relevant erm you'll see from our submissions to the panel that er quite clearly the City Council did not agree entirely with the proposed boundary of the greenbelt, the City Council did take the view that there were certain areas of land proposed to be included in the greenbelt er which did not fulfil a greenbelt function in the Council's view, and that was clearly was discussed at the greenbelt inquiry, it was not just one site, er we clearly were not not in our er responsibility to identify a specific site outside our district, but there were a number of areas er subject to those objections, not just from ourselves, but as Mr erm Donson has said er from various objectors. The greenbelt boundary as I mentioned earlier as proposed by the County Council is very tightly drawn, excluding the sites which have been mentioned which our allocated, there is no land between the edge of the urban area and the proposed greenbelt boundary and that does seem to us, continues to seem to us er not an appropriate way forward. In terms of the\\nI'm sorry David, I thought\\nIn terms of the definition of er what is historic York I think again an issue we went over for some length of time at the greenbelt inquiry, I would draw your attention back to my earlier comments that York is basically a modern industrial city with a very precious historic core, that historic core er represents no more than actually five percent of the built up area, that something like eighty five percent of the city was built after eighteen hundred, the view that was expressed by the County in N Y Two, in terms of the definition of the greenbelt, the Greater York greenbelt and its purposes was not accepted by the City Council, we do not accept that all of the func elements of the York greenbelt contribute towards preserving the character of the historic city, we rely on the the fact that the two comments the Senior Inspector made at this, the the green wedges and historic core itself that establish the historic character of the city, there are many parts of the edge of York which could repli be replicated in many cities, historic or otherwise around the country  and finally just coming back to the issue of scale of development erm the point I should have made earlier about the house builders figures for the city of York is that the house builders did suggest a figure of four thousand for the city, erm, I'm not aware on what basis that was made, but clearly my evidence would quite clearly indicate that I believe that could not be accommodated, certainly on any known sites within the cit current city boundary, thank you Chair. Mr Sedgewick, can I just ask Mr Sedgewick to . Sedgewick, Michael Courcier, and partners. As you know from our submission, sir,n we've taken a more modest requirement for the Greater York area, and that's based to some extent upon what we think is is achievable there, we're not saying that erm the figure should not be higher, we're not saying that the H B F figure for instance should nu not be er put in there, but what we're saying is if that higher figure does go in because of the clear constraints on the provision of additional land the the higher figure may well mean that there's a need for two new settlements ra rather than just one. The approach we've taken which is set set out in our our submission in section seven, we've we believe that maybe some nine hundred additional sites could be found, this is in addition to the existing allocations, er some nine hundred additional sites could be found within Greater York, by making changes to the boundary of the greenbelt, we you do it the greenbelt is too extensive in some parts, it can be rolled back without affecting the the purpose, erm Mr Donson's already already identified those areas, if that's the case, on our figures a settlement of fourteen hundred plus nine hundred on other sites is is is quite achievable. In the longer term, if there i is a need for a for addi additional supply that can be be done by increasing the size of the segment or or using some of this additional land.\",\n",
       " 'Thank you.',\n",
       " \"Thank you. Mr Davis. This is very brief and solely for the record, Chairman, at the York greenbelt local plan inquiry the City Council made one objection, and one objection only, in respect of sites, and that was a site that straddled the York Selby boundary, that was there only expressed concern on sites specific objection, one site in the entire plan. That's a matter of record. Thank you. Well I think, probably ought to make it clear of course that we won't have available to us the greenbelt local plan enquiry, so\\nWell certainly not in the period during which we're going to be discussing the various submissions, er un un at the E I P, now Mr Heselton, erm in a way your comments yesterday would probably be taken that Selby could cope, or would be prepared to cope, even with additional development, now you better sa tell me whether that's true or false, and I'm thinking particularly of that element of Greater Sel , of Selby which is in Greater York. Er, yes that's that's true to a degree, Chairman. Er Terry Heselton, Selby District. Erm well in in the context of what I did say yesterday it'll come as no great surprise to anyone that like Ryedale we also accept the North Yorkshire County County figures, erm which in short we we find are based on reasonable assumptions and and and an appropriate methodology, compared to some of the more extreme interpretations and projections that have that have been put forward, if I can illustrate that point by reference to er potential building rates, that the highest figure that's been suggested is the one put forward by Mr Grigson, of Barton Willmore, I'm talking for the moment about Greater York generally, and I'll come onto the Selby aspect in a minute. That's a suggested figure of twelve thousand seven hundred, which imply a building rate of eight hundred and forty six a year, in comparison with the adopted re er rate in the in the adopted plan of six o six and an actual building rate of seven o one, er  my re calculation shows that that would be a thirty nine percent increase, over the adopted plan rate, and a twenty one percent increase over the actual rate. In comparison the er the the smallest projection put forward by Mr Thomas, would actually result in a twenty one percent decrease in building rates over that approved in the adopted adopted plan, and a thirty two percent increase over the actual rate experienced since nineteen eighty one. So I don't find either of those those two alternatives acc acceptable largely on the basis of of the arguments put put forward yesterday. Mhm, yes. So coming back more specifically to Selby, and taking er Mr Curtis's ball-park figure of of seventeen hundred, erm now already we've we've got approximately eight hundred and fifty committed in terms of a hundred and eighty con er completions, five hundred and sixty permissions including conversions, and a hundred and ten dwellings identified on a site at Elvington in in the Greater York study, and there's really not a great deal more flexibility, erm, because of the greenbelt constraint. We fully support and endorse the deposit greenbelt boundaries, then I think it's inescapable that at at some point that is going to lead us to leapfrogging over the greenbelt boundary, at some stage during the the the plan period, there may well be sufficient erm commitment and identified sites to to mop up in in the short term, but by the end of of the plan period it's it's my belief that there will be a need to address this issue by bringing forward proposals for a new settlement, er which obviously Selby district er full fully supports. And you would see that as an inevitable er way forward if you want to meet the housing provision in strategic terms in Greater York. That's that's right, I mean I I I would suggest that we've arrived at that point now, and we're increasingly likely to do so, because as we've already heard York is very constrained, it's it's it's a relatively small, compact, historic city, the greenbelt boundaries are drawn fairly tightly, correctly in so in in my opinion, and there's really not much room for manoeuvre within with er in a existing settlements within the greenbelt.\",\n",
       " \"Thank you. Mr Donson. Er Roy Donson, House Builders' Federation. I just wanted to take up the point that's been raised again, and it keeps popping its its little head up from time to time, this issue of building rates. I would say to you that the history of North Yorkshire County is that the house house builders have built, more or less the building rate of planning policy, whatever that has been, and that is a matter of fact, and if and if and if we are in a situation where the market is being fettered, as is the policy, and it's not a policy which we are seeking to go away from specifically, and it is inevitable that the  house builders will build to whatever the policy building rate is, and comparisons of one building rate with another are simply telling you what's happened in the past, not what needs to happen in the future er in terms of meeting the housing requirement, and quite clearly in any area where you are introducing a new settlement, if indeed that's the conclusion we come to, er late later on, erm and I hope we do, but if we are introducing a new settlement you are bound to skew the building rates, and the more and more you reduce the area in which you consider what the building rate effect is the more and more that it actually gets skewed, er and erm you know, quite frankly, when the developers built a new estate at the end of my particular street the building rate went up alarmingly in my area, er and er you know, we can go on forever like that, I just think it's very misleading to just deal with the judgement of building rates. Mr Thomas. Thank you. I had thought that builders built houses when they thought they thought they could sell them, I didn't realize it was part of some altruistic policy of complying with planning policy, still we learn everything every day, don't we? Erm, sir, I want to address the point, if it's the right time about the level of housing provision the Greater York area in particular, erm that we've seen round the table here that we have special circumstances applying to York, and to its surrounding area. Erm I won't dwell on York city centre and its historic core because you're all clearly aware of that, but it its setting was accepted at the greenbelt enquiry as being sufficiently important to warrant protection wider than just its physical, existing physical limits, erm the special protection was accorded also to the the special character rather was accorded also to the surrounding countryside, much of which is very attractive, and many of the typical Yorkshire small villages and hamlets that surround the area as well, er and we're clearly in a position in Greater York which is different from the position that arises in many other counties and many other districts within this county, we're in a position of grave shortage of suitable, developable land, we're in a position of high quality er character, and landscape, we're in a position where York, in particular , has extremely good transportation links, to the Leeds Bradford conurbation, where we discuss at length over the last two days there are policies for urban regeneration, subject to regional planning guidance in that area erm and we're in a position where quite clearly York is under pressure, a great deal of pressure from migrants, er because it's a it's an attractive location to live. When you put all these factors together it concerns me that nobody has been advancing the case that as with other districts, some other districts in York, it would be appropriate, even more appropriate in my view, that the migration assumption should be discounted, there are in my view special reasons why this should be the case, special reasons over and above tho those that have been applied, to the other districts, this in my view would be that the Greater York housing provision for all those reasons I've just highlighted, should be reduced, should be reduced to the seventy five percent level, in other words that would be reducing it by between a thousand and twelve hundred and fifty houses, now I won't get on to the reason that the fact that that's one reason why there's no need for a new settlement, erm but it is a reason in its own right just to protect the character and the capacity requirements and the environmental sensitivities of the Greater York area. A second factor which I'd like to raise, and please stop me, sir, if I'm not playing your ground rules here, is to get back to the original point made by Mr Davis, as to how this figure is going to be split between the districts, I think it's absolutely essential that this figure is split between the districts, and it may well be, if you decide, sir, to recommend in favour of the new settlement that you may have to leave that as a floating figure to go around the districts, at the moment it is not. I would like to have more information from the County, or anyone else from the table for that matter, how this figure's going to be split, clearly P P G requires it to be split between district, and I'd like to see it split on that basis. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr Thomas. Erm I I get the impression from what you're saying is that there is a distinct strategic view which should be taken about York and its role, which in a way would tend to limit the amount of housing development you should be putting in and around York. Indeed, er and \\nAnd that's the way the authorities should be moving forward with their planning for the county. I think that is the case, doubly so considering the discussion yesterday where we saw, that whether some of the districts liked it or not there is going to be development in excess of the projected figures in their relevant districts over the plan period. There is slack elsewhere to effect a redistribution to the benefit of York and its Greater York area. Probably an el well certainly an element which ought to be considered within the umbrella of the R P G but lets \\nIndeed. wait and see what comes out of that. Er I'm glad you raised the point about the distribution between the districts, and apart from your comment er I know Mr Davis is opposed to the idea, I haven't discerned a view either way from anyone else, whether they would like them or would not like them. Well it seems to me, sir, that er the new settlement is becoming a bit of a dustbin which people are throwing their unspent allocations in, and then passing it around from district to district\\nMhm. and Selby are the people who are prepared to take it\\nI have \\nit maybe it maybe, sir, you should allocate all the housing to Selby, and we can all go home. I'm I'm about to apologize to Mr Grigson, because I see from his submission he actually did distribute it by district within the er Greater York area, er  yea, planning by Selby is not I think the right approach, but. Mr Cunnane, sorry, Mr Grigson, you want to come in? Well i I'm happy, I mean I was just going to make that point, sir, but I do have other points, but I'll wait . Can we have Mr Cunnane, then Mr Sedgewick, and then we will have a coffee break. Chairman. Joe Cunnane. My point is a very short one, I I simply need to put it on the record that it is erm our position that the panel should distribute the er ove York overspill, if I can call it that, as well, that the panel should address the issue of distribution, because our fear is th is th is is is the Selby problem, that Selby are embarked upon a clear strategy of er substantial growth, and we do not want to see er the Greater York overspill being unduly er dir funnelled channelled in that direction.\",\n",
       " \"Thank you. Mr Sedgewick. Sedgewick, Michael Courcier and partners. Our position in in the submission was that if there is not the the need to distribute York's own population around Greater York, then the argument for a separate Greater York figure disappears. The the original purpose was to to deal with problems arising within the city of York. If you feel from the discussion around the table that the u requirements of York have not been properly reflected in the the published H One figure er and that there is a need to distribute that population, and therefore there is going to be a Greater York figure. The overlap with the districts needs to be eradicated, it's a black hole at the moment, every district can pass a its surplus on to another district, and indeed it would be the last district to prepare a district wide local plan that has to meet the residue of the Greater York requirement, it may maybe a good stimulus for the districts to get on with their local plans, but that's not an  planning way. What we would advocate, as indeed Mr Smith did earlier, is that there should be a a global figure for Greater York, and a reduction, in an appropriate reduction in the requirement for each district, and I believe that anticipating you might ask me what that is what that reduction should be, erm I I can say it must be related to the ca capacity, of that district within Greater York. That proposition presupposes that if you make a reduction in the district figures, then you must have an idea what the district contribution towards the Greater York figure is, er and I find it difficult to see that you can have, if you have a new settlement, if you have a new settlement the C provision for the new settlement floating in this table, erm but can I just say before we adjourn for coffee, that I really would like to have some very firm answers to the questions which are posed under issue two, er and particularly about two D and that is specific guidance on the location of the new settlement. Assuming you end up with a new settlement. Can we break for coffee? Yes. Sir announced the the end of debate one, I certainly wasn't under the impression that it had finished. Well, I've got, if you you just bear with me a moment, I still have one foot dragging in H one, but I thought we'd got to the stage where in order to try and clarify thinking on the matter we ought to progress onto H two, erm, that just let me reveal the thinking, erm that, before I do that can I just say in terms of mechanics those of you who have just joined us for the first time, could you turn your name boards round so I can see them, thank you, and when you want to come in the normal practice is to put your name board on end, so it will attract our attention. But just let me come back to the the point I want to make, it is it evident to us from what was said yesterday collectively by the District Councils, that they could live with the figure of forty one thousand two hundred, as proposed by the County Council, without a new settlement. There's a corollary to th that was is our impression, from the various views that were sp s spelt out around the table. You'll have a chance to come back on whether we have got the wrong impression on that, I mean I recall Mr Heselton's quite clearly, but let me pursue that at a stage further if if we take that as our impression of what you have said collectively, and you are asked to make provision for nine thousand seven hundred dwellings, again collectively in the Greater York area, and I'm addressing this question to the districts, what provision would you make in your districts of your district figure in the Greater York area? Mr Davis, you want to make a comment? Well I was I've looked, Peter Davis, North Yorkshire, I've just glanced down the table at certainly at the er my Greater York district colleagues, and er certainly we er are rather surprised that er you have the impression that you have the impression that er erm we could do without the erm the new settlement, quite clearly erm erm certainly Harrogate, Selby, er and Ryedale, and the County Council, believe the the new settlement is absolutely essential, erm and I think that's erm erm certainly a matter of agreement between er us and those three districts, it's absolutely essential. I think the point, I think the point we're making is that none of the districts yesterday told us that to meet their figure in H one they would need to have a new settlement, for example, I well remember Selby saying to us if we go above our H one figure we would need a new settlement, but they did not say to meet our H one figure we would need a new settlement. Mr Heselton. It's in that \\nSorry. context that we are ask now want to get clarification from the District Councils as to what proportion of there H one figure would be in the Greater York area. Er may may I reply, please? Mr Heselton first, yes. Thank you. Terry Heselton, Selby District. Er it yes it it's true to tell, gone on record on several occasions saying in terms of environmental capacity  there's the potential within Selby district to accommodate eleven and a half thousand dwellings, however I did later qualify those comments with reference to the emerging local plan, which is the main vehicle we've we've got for identifying potential development sites and the the qualification was that was that land is not necessarily available in in the right places, to enable us to make a a reasonable distribution for development in accordance with P P G advice, so that the question of a new settlement remains an extremely attractive option for Selby District, and as I mentioned this morning, in terms of whi we would be approximately eight hundred and fifty dwelli whi we would be approximately eight hundred and fifty dwellings short, in any case, erm\\nHow much are you saying would be in the Greater York area in your district? Well I haven't suggested a a figure, I made reference  and I also referred to the fact that when you then discounted completions, identified sites, and existing measurements, you would be approximately eight hundred and fifty dwellings short. Short of Mr short of Mr Curtis's figure ? If if if I be yes, Mr Curtis's ball-park figure. Mhm, so we'll we'll credit you with minus eight fifty, shall we? This probably being the best  \\nEr as as a basic starting point yes.\",\n",
       " \"Yes. Mr Allanby. Er David Allanby, Harrogate Borough Council. Erm first of all Chairman I would confirm that it is our view that with a provision of six thousand five hundred for Harrogate district, we don't think we'd be looking at a new settlement to serve our needs, erm, having said that, we support the Greater York strategy, and we we certainly the level of provision erm for Greater York as proposed by the County Council, er but leaving aside for one moment the issue of a new settlement, it is our view that we'll be able to accommodate the level of growth that I think is anticipated in our district, erm, within the figures, and I'm referring specifically to N Y one, and the table on the last page where there's an indication there of the sort of of er housing numbers that would would have to be accommodated within Harrogate district, and and our part of Greater York is essentially a rural character consisting of a a number of small villages, so there there we have er a total figure of two hundred dwellings to be provided within our part of Greater York, that basically represents erm existing commitments and a a yield from small sites in the future, perhaps conversions, and we'r we're quite happy with that. I think our view is that if that provision was to be any greater, then we would have significant difficulty in accommodating that provision within our part of Greater York, primarily for for greenbelt considerations, not reasons, erm any additional provision would require a rolling back of the greenbelt, er significant provision would have two implications, erm either it would mean peripheral expansion er of York into the greenbelt around York and into our district, we feel that would adversely affect the special character of York, lead to outward sprawl of the York urban area, encroachment into open countryside, and coalescence of the urban area with the villages in our district, er and we we wouldn't want to support that. The other option would be expanding the villages themselves, and we find that that would be equally harmful, so we'd be opposed to any significant additional development in our district over and above that that's that's been assumed in that table. Mhm. If I if m I summarize that, I know Harrogate have supported the principle of a new settlement within the Greater York figure, but you hadn't anticipated that it would bite on your district, if I can use that word. We er haven't er certainly been through or down the road of looking at whether there are sites within our district that that could accommodate that, that exercise is still to be done. But if I put it another way, you could meet your anticipated contribution to the Greater York figure as spelt out in the structure plan? That's right, sir. Ninety seven hundred. Thank you. Mr Jewitt. Michael Jewitt, Hambledon District. Michael Jewitt, Hambledon District Council. Erm, before we leave item one D, sir, there are two things that Hambledon would like to say both on the q questions that the Chairman asked, capacity, and also on the principal of breaking down the Greater York figure i into the constituent districts, erm, the first point, on capacity, erm, we feel that we have a very limited capacity, er to accommodate development needs advising in Greater York, you'll see from our statement that we have just two settlements an , sorry three settlements in two parishes er within the defined Greater York area, Shipton, Beningborough, and Overton. Two of these settlements have just ten and eleven dwellings respectively, erm Shipton is the only settlement of any consequence erm being two hundred and er twenty dwellings. Now, within that overall context it it really would be meaningless to identify a contribution for Hambledon in terms of Greater York, as this erm figures are so are so small. The second point being that erm if a figure was to be identified for Greater York, we'd feel that this would er unduly interfere with our duties and responsibilities as a District Council to allocate land in our district, cos in effect what it would do is direct us to making a housing allocation in one particular settlement, Shipton, we feel that's our responsibility not the County Council.\",\n",
       " \"Mhm. Mhm. Isn't \\nGo on, go on. Isn't there an argument, and perhaps I am st getting now onto two, matter two, that says from Hambledon's point of view, what has just been said is compelling, is a compelling argument in favour of identifying where the new settlement should go, because that will, at the same time, identify where it should not go? Ah erm well, Chairman, I I think that this is something that's going to cut, as far as Hambledon's got concerns, is going to come up in the erm in the next debate, certainly, erm, the erm, the issue of erm whether policy should be expressed in terms of principle and criteria, or erm area and a district as being a dilemma erm to Hambledon, erm, it feels it's erm erm not being able to support the policy as defined, because ultimately the Council would object to a new settlement in Hambledon. Erm, and therefore it feels it would be disingenuous of it to support the principle at this stage, it may well lead to a situation where were encouraging the County to go down a particular route, but only to get to the very end of it for us to pull the rug from beneath the County's feet. Mm. Yes, erm we are aware of the the view that the District Council have expressed, about the new settlement, that's perfectly clear. But if I just turn your attention to the figures that are postulated in the County Council's N Y one, the tabulation in paragraph twenty on the last page, it's attributed forty dwellings due in Hambledon, more or less. My understanding of the situation in Hambledon is that there are, we're talking only small figures I realize, there are twenty commitments currently, within that area, erm clearly there are going to be some unidentified sites come forward erm, I don't wish to er  critical of that figure, I would accept the figure. Sorry? I would accept that figure and \\nThank you. Yes. Mr Smith, Ryedale. Chairman. Ian Smith Ryedale District. I've already said this morning that the District Council does not consider that it can accommodate any further dwellings within the Southern Ryedale area without adversely affecting the character of the settlements that are already there, or compromising  greenbelt objectives, erm, so therefore to meet the Greater York total, the District Council considers it essential that there is a new settlement to take that amount of housing that cannot be accommodated within the Southern Ryedale area. What figure can you accommodate in South Ryedale? Part of. Sorry, in Rye in the Ryedale part of the Greater York. If you look at table, at the County Council's M \\nYes. Y one, erm\\nIs that the one you can live with? We could live with that figure, and indeed our local plan is based on on that sort of a figure, being accommodated within that area. And the York figure we take as three thousand three hundred, Mr Curtis. Dave Curtis, York City Council. Yes, sir. And ou and going back to Mr Heselton, he has said i , I've got a negative factor for him at the moment in terms of minus eight fifty, but let let me let me take the figure which is actually quoted in the County Council's table of nine fifty dwellings. Is it nine fifty, or is it something slightly higher, or something less? Er, Terry Heselton, Selby District. Erm, I believe the figure of nine fifty also includes a an allowance for windfalls windfalls. Mr Heselton, I understood you said when we started this debate that you were eight hundred and fifty short, or thereabouts, of Mr Curtis's pro-rata figure, which was four thousand two hundred. Did I misunderstand ? No, er Mr Curtis's er hypothetical figure \\nYes. of seventeen hundred. Mm. I beg your pardon? Yes. Which takes you back to nine fifty. Sorry, eight fifty. Eight fifty, more \\nYes. or less. Yes. Hypothetical. So in progressing through there, and I'm sorry we haven't done it this way, we end up in terms of the County Council figure of nine seven hundred for Greater York, possible er provision from, collectively from the districts of about fourteen hundred, fifteen hundred short. Is my arithmetic correct?\",\n",
       " \"Yes. Thank you. Mr Grantham. Erm\\nAnd then Mr Thompson. Er I just want wanted to to pick up on your your opening remarks, sir, after coffee, that that the impression you had was that the the the districts, erm, could live with a that the County Council figures. Erm with without a new settlement erm that that was indeed the the impression that erm I was left with as well, and what what we've sought to do in in the evidence that we've we've put before you is to take the nine seven, nine thousand seven hundred figure in Greater York, and and er s based on the data supplied by the County Council to to demonstrate that that actually when one looks at outstanding commitments erm with planning permission, identified the sites er without planning permission, those those that are allocated in local plans, making suitable allowances for small sites erm windfall sites and conversion, erm the the residual figure that is left in Greater York, which I calculate to be eight thousand six hundred and thirty seven, once one has taken away completions, which I think is an agreed figure between nineteen ninety one and nineteen ninety three of one thousand and sixty three, that erm, those existing commitments, and the sites likely to come forward,ma virtually match the figure for the outstanding housing requirement, so so one is left with a view that erm from from the data that's put in front of us that there isn't a residue of that size to to accommodate, although I accept that there may well be a residue of some sort, erm and it seems to me that the established Greater York erm framework, er is is the process by which that is distributed around the counties along the lines that the discussion's proceeded this morning. In that context I think it would be helpful to us erm if we could have submitted to us a version of the table originally submitted by the H B F relating to commitments. Relating solely to the Greater York area. If you remember at the end of yesterday, Mr Donson will no doubt correct me if I'm wrong, he fige finished up, we started the day with a total guaranteed minimum of about thirty three and a half thousand, we got that up by arithmetic to thirty four point nine thousand, and I think we finished up at around thirty six thousand at the end of the day. I think it would be very helpful to the panel to know what proportion of that thirty six thousand is within the district, within the Greater York area, don't ask for that to be done now, because it may well involve some difficult arithmetic, perhaps it's tonight's homework. Is that possible Mr Donson? Roy Donson, House Builders' Federation, it's not possible by me, no, but\\nRight. I'll I'll leave it to the  \\nYour sources your sources of supply are on the other side of the room.\",\n",
       " 'Indeed they are, yes. Thank you.',\n",
       " \"Mr Thomas. Yes, thank you, sir. I think that the districts there possibly given the exception of Selby have taken a rather cautious approach as to what they anticipate being built in their areas within the Greater York area itself er over the next thirteen years. Er a similar cautious approach which none of them took yesterday when on examination it was found that there was more potential there than before, erm so to help with the figures I have found very helpful erm appendix eight to the er York City Council erm statement, I think it appears in both of their statements   appendix eight Greater York housing provision   sorry, could could I also direct you at the same time to the County Council's N Y five appendix three   now the, the two make interesting comparisons because they both start of with the same H one proposal of nine thousand seven hundred dwellings, and I'll remind you there, sir, that only five thousand seven hundred of those are required by the existing population, four thousand of those are for migrants, and the two schedules go of in slightly different directions under the heading of completions, and the reason for that, sir, is that the the Greater York, the er County Council's figures, as you can see were computed in October nineteen ninety two when only seven hundred dwellings had been completed, yet six months later, under item C for the Greater York er housing provision figure, York Ci York City Council figures, the completions were one thousand and sixty three. Erm, I'll not go through the whole of this table sir, but I do want you to look at the next column, outstanding planning permissions. In October nineteen ninety two the outstanding planning permissions were three thousand three hundred and fifty, in April nineteen ninety three, there were three thousand four hundred and seventy three. In fact sir, the County Council's figures produced in another appendix, can't lay my hands on it at the moment, had put this figure in as three thousand six hundred and fifty, but the nub of those two things are, that over that six month period, we're not only seeing more houses built but we have more consented, and that hasn't affected the residue that appears in the rest of these schedules. Now the County Councils and the City Council's assessment of the capacity of the Greater York study sites are roughly the same, you can see, sir, that as things have moved forward in only a six month period, the City Council calculate there's a residual requirement of nine hundred and forty seven dwellings, only twenty five percent of the migration assumption, none hundred and forty seven dwellings left, compared to the County Council's outdated information which suggested it's one thousand three hundred and thirty five. Both of those figures, sir, exclude any windfalls whatsoever over the next thirteen years, now if that is a justification for a new settlement, I'm a disbeliever. It clearly is not the case, that, we have heard from the city this morning, and in the city alone windfalls have been progressing at the rate of eighty per annum, if it was only half that rate over the next thirteen years we would see five hundred more houses, and that excludes windfalls from the rest of the Greater York area, excluding the city of York. It is quite clear, sir, that on the existing allocations, thirteen years to go, that the figure of nine thousand seven hundred dwellings, if you want to stick by that figure, my view it should be lower because it has too much an assumption for migration in a constrained area, if you want to stick by that figure, the nine thousand seven hundred will be reached without a new settlement, of that I have no doubt whatsoever. Now, a new settlement option is a last ditch option, we're far from being the last ditch here, we're hardly the first ditch.\",\n",
       " \"Thank you. Thank you. Mr Grigson. Thank you, sir. Steven Grigson, Barton Willmore. I will want to come back on the same point that's just been made, but if before I get to that there are some other points that I think I should make in explanation of the lead we have given, if I may call it that, in putting forward the distribution of the Greater York total. I think it's necessary to to set the scene for that to say that in fact as between the County Council and Barton Willmore there's very little difference in what we see are the requirements for the ring around the city, we both have a figure of of six thousand and something quite small. The difference between our figures for Greater York and the County Council's figures for Greater York arise almost entirely within York City, and bi I think been established earlier this morning that some overspill, albeit the size maybe in dispute, is necessary from the city into the ring. Erm I think it's also now pretty much common ground that the capacity of York city is around three thousand three hundred, but I think in in in taking an view on that, and in taking any view o on future windfalls, it is necessary for the panel to keep in mind that historically in the nineteen eighties windfalls were coming through at a time when it was not a adopted local plan for the city of York, so to some extent anything by definition of a substantial size was likely to be a windfall, erm, but also more to the point than that definitional point, I would expect to see, and I think what Mr Curtis has said earlier on that the local plan is likely to tighten up on criteria for release of sites, both small and large, he referred to the shortage of open space, and I would expect to see a policy change in short, a policy climate change, within the city of York that would constrain past historical rates of windfall release. So that I think the situation affecting the Greater York area is that there wis there is a requirement to accommodate within the ring part of the needs of the city, and on our best estimate that er I apologize for the word overspill, but it it is descriptive, is of the order of three thousand three hundred dwellings to be accommodated in the ring which after the needs of York. I don't intend to discuss the  housing, whether seven hundred acres, sorry seven l land for seven hundred houses is owned by the City of York, that's not part of our case one way or the other, but we have offered you a distribution of the Greater York provision figure between the districts, because from Barton Willmore's very extensive experience of participation in local plan work up and down the country, I think we share the view that er City of York have, that Ryedale have, my colleagues to the left and right on this side of the table have, that there does need to be a distribution, otherwise there will be at best confusion as to whether local plans comply with the structure plan, and at worst a game of of pass the parcel and everybody will be conforming, but nobody will actually be possibly meeting the figures, and that is the situation that I don't think anybody would wish to see as a result of er the outcome of of alteration number three, I mean I don't know how the County Council would would really be able to to say whether they thought a local plan conformed to the structure plan, without knowing what that distribution was, perhaps in some bottom draw manner which is not now the approved way of going about these things, so that I think there does need to be a distribution for the proper planning of York, and before coming on to our to explain our figures a little bit, I should also say, perhaps in in response to remarks Mr Thomas made earlier on about the general character of the York area and the need to to protect that, that that course is precisely what the greenbelt is for, and what it does, it isn't necessary to extend that concept across the whole of the vale of York, and therefore to seek to er discount migration outside the greenbelt. That is what the greenbelt is actually there for, and if you have it there for that purpose, as I said yesterday, the necessary corollary is that you have additional provision beyond it, and  I can't resist to offer Mr Wincup some support, I'm sure one piece of evidence that he gave you about the letter from the Parish Council, he's probably already replied to that Parish Council saying, as you're in the York greenbelt have no fear, all the Selby needs will pass straight across your heads and land somewhere else. The erm point about are distribution within Greater York is that we have attempted to look at this in what I think is a a rational and realistic manner, we have looked, and you'll see this from our supplementary paper, I apologize for its lateness, but I think it's benefited from the additional thought that could be given to it, we have looked both backwards, at the present day, and forwards, we've looked backwards at past build rates, we've looked at the present day position in the sense of the population shares within Greater York, and we've looked forwards in terms of the commitment figures that are given in the N Y one paper that we've just been looking at, and taking all those things into account, and adding in what we see as the right location for a new settlement, namely Selby district, we come to the figures that are in our supplementary paper, and there is clearly a great deal of common ground between the evidence you get from looking either at past building rates or population shares, as now, or future commitments which all point towards a broadly similar distribution, we say, with the addition of a new feature namely the new settlement, so that I commend those figures to you as somebody who's actually dared to put their toe, or maybe their whole body into the water, and given you not only some numbers, but also a basis by which if you should er have a different Greater York figure in mind, a basis on which that could be rationally er approached, I would not certainly defend to the last ditch the need to put a figure of fifty dwellings into the structure plan for the Hambledon part of Greater York, there may be a cut off point beyond which you don't go, but certainly for Ryedale and Selby, with very substantial numbers there is a need to indicate what the appropriate division should be, and you could not for instance indicate what the er Ryedale non Greater York figure was, without someone telling us the, as the Chairman rightly said, having an idea of what the Ryedale Greater York figure should be, so it isn't really I think feasible to have district figures for non Greater York, and one Greater York figure, that doesn't er get away from the issue, and nor does it solve the potential for confusion. My final point, is that, and we have had it raised this morning, erm from er I think it was consultants on behalf of the C P R E that there was sufficient capacity within Greater York, and they referred to a table in their  and their submission. I had a close look at that table, obviously a matter of some interest and that's the reason I return to this, as I read the table, there is a very substantial amount of double counting within it, for this reason, that all outstanding er planning permissions are included once, and there are then separate categories of allowance for all types of sites, namely large windfalls, conversions, small sites, and allocated sites, those are all put in, er or most of them are put in at thirteen years worth, that being the remainder of the plan period to two thousand and six, it will not have escaped you that if you include thirteen years worth all the existing commissions are part of that thirteen years, and so  simplest approach to correct that table would simply to discount the outstanding commitments, because they're all counted again as part of the thirteen years, I do have a secondary point that the allowance for conversions is very much higher than what seems to be happening, and in what is in the tables that er Mr Thomas drew it to your attention from the York City er appendix eight, so that er on on two counts, but mainly the double counting one there is a great deal of er erm optimism, if I can call it that, in that table.\",\n",
       " \"Thank you. Thank you. Mr Curtis. Thank you Chair. David Curtis, York City Council. Er I merely want to comment on the erm apparent misunderstanding on my comments on windfalls earlier on, erm it has been suggested that we we're tightening down on windfalls, was the quote actually used, erm, there is no intention in the local plan to er ignore the er windfalls, to actually deal with them in a different way than had happened in the past, clearly if sites come forward which are windfalls which are suitable in environmental terms then the City Council will give, as P B G one requires, the appropriate consideration to those applications, what I was merely saying this morning was the the likelihood of such windfalls coming forward, and the scale was clearly going to be substantially less than had occurred in the past, and the the figure of eighty a eighty a year, which was for a five year period, which was quoted to me, erm clearly would not be representative of my expectation of the future. Thank you. Er Mr Spittle. Malcolm Spittle, County Council. Erm I was going to pick up on a number of points that have been raised by previous speakers, but erm Mr Grigson and Mr Curtis seem to have er dealt with a few of those, erm just with regard to the the table put in by C P R E, with their figures, I would just agree with Mr Cur er Mr Grigson that there is a very substantial degree of double counting in those figures, there is also a very substantial degree of over provision in the allowance for for conversions, er past conversion rates in Greater York have averaged something like twenty nine dwellings per year, over a fifteen year period your talking about four hundred and thirty five dwellings, which is the figure that both York City Council and ourselves have have made allowance for for conversions, that compares with a figure of a thousand dwellings referred to by the C P R E and I see no foundation for that figure, erm, as I say Mr Curtis already picked up on the point about windfalls rates by Mr Thomas, erm just turning to the difference between the tables er submitted by the County Council and York City Council on the the residue within the er Greater York area, I would accept the figure, the figures put in the tables by Mr er by Mr Curtis, I think that they have picked up the the more recent planning permissions and the completions information, and they also take on board there more recent work on erm development within the city, and I I accept that table. Thank you. Mr Smith. Ian Smith, Ryedale District. I'd like to comment on Mr Grigson's table, in particular the figure proposed for Ryedale, er his figure is based on the assumption that because Selby gets the new settlement it therefore gets a corresponding reduction in house building elsewhere in the Greater York portion of Selby. The development strategy adopted in the Greater York study never envisaged that the settlement, or the district that got the new settlement would therefore get a corresponding reduction in the amount of land it had to provide to meet the needs of the Greater York area, the strategy we use to identify sites within the Greater York area that could be developed without compromising greenbelt objectives, and that the new settlement would be added on outside that area without a reduction in that that figure.\",\n",
       " \"Mhm. Mr Cunnane. Er Joe Cunnane,Sa representing Sam Smith's Brewery Tadcaster. Just like to make a comment on Mr Grigson's submission erm points on erm the Greater York figure. First of all I should point out that the Nor the County Council er figure of none thousand seven hundred is actually a figure for local needs plus one hundred percent migration, and if you follow Mr Thomas's figures that leaves a residual requirement of nine hundred and forty seven dwellings without any windfalls over the next thirteen years, which is quite inconceivable, so in order to establish his point on the need for the new settlement on tha on on his figures, the Bar Mr Grigson of Barton Willmore has to up the figure for Greater York to twelve thousand seven hundred, as set out in his erm paper. The s the point I would make is that first of all I don't accept that twelve thousand seven hundred is er a tenable figure but that, probably the more important point is that there has to be a policy response, and a policy response to this issue demands that there is at least some response to the mi to the level of migration er you know my my my view has been put forward very clearly about that, but I would simply make make the point for the record that even accepting one hundred percent migration, there is no statistical case for a new settlement.\",\n",
       " 'Thank you. Mr Sedgewick. Sedgewick, Michael Courcier and Partners. The may maybe I just comment on that that last that last point, which as I understand it it the the justification for a new settlement is brought about solely by increasing the requirement for Greater York to twelve thousand seven hundred, going through those figures there seems to me, for instance, for both Ryedale and Selby to be more provision than could be met in a single settlement, I I think the the figures put forward by Barton Willmore are more than can be met in existing allocations and a single new settlement of a reasonable size. So I I think the new settlement remains justified even with the significantly lower figure for Greater York.',\n",
       " \"Mhm. Thank you. I noted the point, erm I think to some extent we probably can now move forward to H two, in in a proper sense, but I'll ask Mr Davis er A if he wishes to give some reaction to the last few comments er and then your lead in to H two. Mr Grigson said he really . I assume Mr Grigson, as he hasn't raised his board has said all he wants to say at this stage on the points that have been made. In relation to factor . Do you want anything else on matter one, Mr Grigson. Mr Grigson, for Barton Willmore. I don't feel any need to respond on on Ryedale o or to Michael Courcier. There was one little bit of leftover, as you've given me an opportunity before I depart, and that was that erm we did discuss earlier today, under this heading the possibilities of erm their being sites on the inner edge or between the built up area, or there might become sites between the built up area and the inner edge of the greenbelt, I think the implication was they may be in Ryedale. My understanding is that A those don't exist at present within the deposit plan, but if they did at some future date, for any reason, that their function would be to be used after two thousand and six to sustain the permanence of the greenbelt.\",\n",
       " 'Thank you very much. Mr Davis.',\n",
       " \"Yes. I think just two points. Er erm we think the nine thousand seven hundred dwellings based on one hundred percent migration for the Greater York area is the appropriate strategic approach erm for the Greater York area, the County Council does not see the need for any policy intervention in terms of migration, in respect of Greater York in the way it feels is necessary in respect of er of four other districts. Erm on a general point about the ability to find extra land, erm in and around the urban area erm of York, particularly erm on the inner edge er of the greenbelt. Having been through the six months of the greenbelt local plan enquiry, I can say quite clearly to this er examination in public, that I doubt whether there is the land available erm er around the inner edge erm erm to increase the level of of housing development in and around the city without seriously prejudicing greenbelt objectives.

So can we now move in the formal sense to looking at the next issue for discussion, which covers policy H two, the Greater York new settlement, and the first part of the issue which we shall address is, does the proposed Greater York new settlement represent an appropriate and justified policy response to the assessed development land requirements of the Greater York area, and I'll ask Mr Davis to make his introductory statement. Peter Davis, North Yorkshire County Council. Thank you Chairman. I'll go straight into er item two A I think the first thing the County Council would would wish to say this erm examination is that er today we are really seeing the culmination of I suspect er ten year work erm in Greater York by the Greater York authority and a particularly intensive period of work over the last five years, er by the Greater York authorities, the paper that I put round N Y five the matter two A really addresses the history and why we reached the conclusions corporately that we have and as all as we've already indicated erm progress was able to be made when the Secretary of State included a Greater York er dimension erm into the er into the structure plan in a the first alteration, erm and that enabled a body of work to be undertaken by the Greater York authority, and I think I ought to say at this point that the Greater York authority comprises of the County Council er and five District Councils, and there you have six different councils, all with an interest in the future of Greater York, sitting down together, trying to sort out the way in which the future of Greater York erm ought ought to be developed, and the means they did it did that of course was through the Greater York study, which began in nineteen eighty eight and started off immediately with a study of forty, fifty development, potential development sites, erm in and around er er Greater York which produced a report, as I said in on page three of the of N Y five, around about April nineteen eighty nine, the conclusions of which were quite clearly unacceptable to erm members of the Greater York authority, because they saw quite clearly, and they were supported by the public in this, that to continue peripheral development, which had been the pattern of development in the Greater York area, erm certainly through the sixties and seventies er was unacceptable in terms of its impact on settlements, and particularly er its impact erm on erm erm the York greenbelt which still at that stage erm had yet to be made statutory, and that was again one of the main stimuli to making progress, the need to s formally define er the York greenbelt. The Greater York authorities therefore looked for a widening of the options available, er, in Greater York, and those that have seen the Greater York study, and it is a document that we've put in to the examination will see that there was a fundamental full scale wide ranging er assessment er of all the options er open er within the er Greater York er area and they are er set out erm in pages three er and four of N Y five. The public consultation exercise that was part of that erm Greater York study, and quite clearly the Greater York study was not a statutory plan, it was an informal plan, but it was the only way really that progress could be made in the absence erm of adopted local plans in Greater York, it was essential that that document was pursued to give a framework for the preparation of district local plans er and the greenbelt local plan, and the resolution that followed the consultation and the long body of work, and I'll read it out, was that the development strategy for Greater York from ninety six to two thousand and six should be based on agreed sites within and on the periphery of the built up area, and that the residual requirement be met for the development of a new settlement or settlements located beyond the outer boundary erm of the greenbelt, a quite clearly there's a major policy implication there that a new settlement was not acceptable within the greenbelt but would have to be er outside the outer boundary of the greenbelt, and the public consultation on that er study er attracted widespread support for a new settlement strategy in Greater York, all six authorities agreed that that was the direction er that had to be taken, it also had another benefit in that it enabled work on the York greenbelt local plan erm to proceed and that has now been taken forward to the stage where the enquiry terminated in May, it's a joint enquiry in the greenbelt local plan enquiry, with a Southern Ryedale local plan enquiry in April ninety three, and we would hope that the inspectors report on that six month enquiry, when he considered all the objections to the er greenbelt proposals of the County Council, largely supported by the er District Council will be available er in the near future. The County Council also accepted as part of this oral approach that there was a need for an alteration to the structure plan, because the approved structure plan did not make provision for a new settlement as an element of approved North Yorkshire strategic policy, and we've progressed that erm alteration through to the examination er in public er today. So the current position is that there's been substantial progress er in Greater York, and I think its testimony to the willingness of the Greater York authorities to work together there that there's been such a level of agreement I think probably er never before achieved in the Greater York area as to the direction that Greater York erm er should take. We think that on balance we have er the majority of the support of the public at large within Greater York, that this is the strategic er approach that is necessary for Greater York, it's necessary to protect the greenbelt and it's necessary to protect communities and villages er in and around erm Greater York. Could I also say one thing finally, and that is the fact that we've tried to run together the alteration and the greenbelt local plan as concurrently er as possible, er it would appear that the timing erm is coming together reasonably satisfactorily erm in that we hope that the report from the greenbelt local plan enquiry, is not to er far distant, erm and we would expect, sir, that you will be reporting on the proceedings at this examination in public er in the not to distant future, well I think I did give an undertaking at the greenbelt local plan enquiry that the County Council, because the two are er interrelated to a degree, that I would expect the County Council would not wish to pursue either report er until er the other er is available, and that seems to the County Council to be entirely sensible, that the two reports, the structure plan alteration and the greenbelt local plan enquiry, erm should be looked at together. There we are, sir, that's erm er er a very brief history erm of erm er of the new settlement strategy, erm it's one clear that the County Council thinks is the appropriate way erm er for the Greater York area er to proceed. Thank you. Thank you. I noted, and we've already had the flavour of it, in to some respect today, that initially you had almost unanimity of support from the District Councils er York City have changed their view erm and equally Hambledon are very luke warm, if I put it no more than that, er on the idea of a new settlement in the sense that they probably support the principle of the new settlement, but not in Hambledon. But could you comment, and no doubt Mr Curtis will also want to amplify why York er seem to have cooled on the idea. There is a there is reference in your paper to that. Yes. Peter Davis, North Yorkshire County Council. I mean York City Council will obviously er Mr Curtis will obviously give his views on the situation, erm the particular issue that seems to have changed the mind of York City Council is the reference in P P G thirteen, transport to sizes of new settlement not being erm er desirable in in in transport terms, small scale resettlements. Now there is no definition of what's small erm erm is erm in er P P G er thirteen and perhaps Mr Curtis could help us in due course erm on an assumption that the new settlement was somewhat larger that th what the County Council is proposing, whether that would erm change the view of York City Council, I I think there is another factor again I could be corrected on this by Mr Curtis and this tended to come out in the greenbelt local plan enquiry, er and that York City Council seem progressively to place more importance on peripheral development than on the new settlement strategy\\nMhm. erm that is my general feeling for erm erm erm the position, York's emerging views erm at the greenbelt local plan enquiry erm weren't shared by the districts er which surround the city, or by the County Council. Strictly on P P G two terms er because of the effect er on the greenbelt, but I wouldn't want to go any further than that, that's my impression, Mr Curtis will undoubtably correct me if I'm wrong. Yes, I mean I noticed from the draft P P G thirteen that they do not define small. How small is small? Mr Curtis, do you want to\\nYes, thank you, Chair. come back on that? David Curtis, York City Council. Erm, clearly their is a a long history of cooperation between the authorities on Greater York, and er I think it is important to explain the development of thinking on that, and the reasons why the City Council has, I would say progressively, er reduced its er the warmth of its enthusiasm to such a state that it's actually become extremely cold now. The original dispersed development strategy ended up with a shortfall, something like two thousand dwellings, compared to the sites which had been agreed between the various authorities at the time, it's also worth noting that that was based on a dwelling target of nine thousand one hundred for Greater York, I think that's correct, over the period since actual sites which have been agreed between the authorities since then have clearly increased, so as you've seen in my appendix eight the residual requirement has now been reduced to a a level of nine hundred and forty seven. The eighty nine strategy was actually supported by four of the authorities including the County Council, but clearly, and I fully appreciate why that decision was made two districts particularly, Ryedale and Selby, felt unable to support the strategy. The City Council, faced with the view that er there was two thousand shortfall in dwellings, that clearly two of our most important neighbours in terms of their land area were unhappy with that proposal, agreed to er proceed to pursue the issue of the new settlement. In that interim period of that work the draft P P G three came out, and made it quite clear that the new settlement would have to lie without beyond the outer edge of the greenbelt, and that was a fur a further consideration. Since that time clearly we've also had a series of further er indications development government guidance on the issue, new P P G one, three, and twelve all produced in March ninety two, which made it quite clear the environmental considerations were to be given greater attention in development plans. P P G three, the revised P P G three when it came out clearly, in my opinion changes the emphasis from the draft P P G three from the draft P P G three, paragraphs thirty two and thirty three which I would emphasize should to be read together, clearly indicates that new settlements are as someone said this morning, sorry, earlier in the discussion today, an issue of last resort. This has further emphasized to ourselves with, I accept our reading of the draft of P P G thirteen, and also more work we've been doing on land in the city, and on the potential traffic implications in particular of further growth outside the ring road. All of those factors lead the City Council to the view that the current level of residual given emerging government advice, the City Council could no longer support the idea of a new settlement of something like fourteen hundred dwellings set in the countryside beyond the outer edge of the York greenbelt. It's interesting to note that actually now we've since made that decision the residual has as I've said come down to nine four seven, so if we do have a new settlement of fourteen hundred we're already ending up with a a higher level of proposed development for Greater York now, the nine seven would obviously be exceeded if we had a fourteen hundred new settlement within Greater York. The further out from York the new settlement goes the less self contained it will be, the more the tendency will be for travel into the city, which is the main service centre to be car based. The belief of the City Council is that, notwithstanding there are clearly difficult traffic problems in the city, there is more opportunity to encourage people to use other more environmentally friendly modes of travel by locating development in and on the edge of the main urban area, a view that's supported by P P G thirteen and the research document onto planning, transport and planning emis planning and transport emissions on which it was based. It's for those reasons, sir, that the City Council feels that it can no longer support the proposed proposals for new settlement, just to come to your question about the issue of scale, I am not able to define what er small is in P P G three, it's obviously been left deliberately vague, but I would draw your attention to the Ucwetec T P A study I've just referred to which makes it quite clear in their terms that to be self contained in transport terms the nearest any settlement ne really needs to be in excess of twenty thousand people. Now I could not countenance, and I'm sure none of the authorities around us could countenance a new settlement that scale in Greater York. If you compare a fourteen hundred new settlement, three thousand people with the new settlements around York, as you've seen in our papers, and some of the papers circulating, it's very similar in size to many of the expanded villages around York, which are all, virtually without exception, commuter settlements for the urban area, so the inevitable consequence of that size of new settlement, in my opinion, be it fourteen hundred, be it two thousand five hundred dwellings, it will be primarily a large housing estate set in the open countryside. On that basis the City Council is doesn't feel able to support to support that proposal. Thank you. Can we have the County Council's response to that? Mr Davis, do you want to make any comment on that? Er yes I do, erm \\nBefore I return to other people. I really don't want to hog the debate because I know there are other \\nNo it's alright, alright . But certainly one, three things I'd like to respond to erm erm mm Mr Curtis. First of all erm he justified his view on environmental considerations as as considered by the City Council, I think we would say, the County Council, that one of the main considerations that has brought us to the conclusion that we have are environmental considerations, the environment of York and its immeding immediate surroundings, the protection er of the York greenbelt, environmental considerations have been er at the most er in our minds. But if I may interrupt, how do you cope with the argument that Mr Curtis was making that if your settlement is, say, less than two and a half thousand it is no more than a large housing estate which relies on the centre of York for its functions, of service, shopping, entertainment, and therefore that the difference between that the difference between a new settlement beyond the greenbelt and peripheral development, in those terms, is no different. Well Mr Curtis of course is erm is what I would describe as using inflammatory descriptions to try and do down what's going to happen with a a new settlement, erm he seems to be convinced that what we're going to end up with er in Greater York is a development of the sort of er er character that he has described, it would be the clear intention of the local authorities to ensure that an appropriate self contained community erm er is developed, now erm there is no re \\nIs that really feasible at that level?\",\n",
       " \"Can, sorry, can I I don't want to stray into item matter B . Mm, mm. if we can at this stage \\nI just want to get the concept of \\nYes, yes. of the thing clear. Is it really feasible that at the sort of level that's being talked about, be it your level or the level being put forward by some of the objectors to the structure plan, the new settlement could actually hope to provide a good level of comparison shopping, for example? Well can we make it absolutely clear that no settlement, anywhere, er in North Yorkshire, or in York and Humberside probably is self contained. If you want to en try and ensure that you're going to have a self sustained community, one hundred percent, you make sure that presumably you've got a show case cinema with fifteen screens there, er a B and Q, erm a whole range of of facilities that nobody ever needs leave, erm erm erm er that new settlement, the reality of the real world of course is that all settlements to a greater or lesser degree, er have a relationship with other er larger scale settlements, now then let's look at the new settlement, fourteen hundred dwellings, we estimate that that is going to be of the order of around three thousand three hundred people, now that is sizeable, it is not small, it is larger than a number of the small market towns er in North Yorkshire, like Boroughbridge, Settle, it is a significant development erm erm and within it erm there will be a requirement er be a requirement for a a a primary school, it justifies that. Certainly we cannot provide a fully one hundred percent sustainable community, you'd be talking about some vast city to move towards that, erm the re the real world is that the the hierarchy of settlements, erm all settlements, have greater or lesser degree of facilities depending on their size, and there'll be no difference er to the new settlement, and I think to to run an argument on the basis of Mr Curtis er has run it is unfair to the concept of the new settlement. Thank you Mr Davis, I, I \\nWell there were two other points Chairman. Yes go on. Erm, the the reference of last resort was Mr Thomas's reference erm it it is not a reference which I think you find anywhere er in government guidance, and I think what P P G thre three says is the opportunity to to pursue them will be relatively rare, we think this is a relatively rare circumstance, er in North Yorkshire, it's unique, er and it's entirely driven er by justifiable er reasons to protect the the wider environment of Greater York. The third thing, and I gu would have to say it's a bit of a red herring thrown out by Mr Curtis is the issue of traffic growth con concern on traffic growth. Could I say to you that in terms of Greater York the County Council is the highway authority, the County Surveyor advises the County Council on traffic implications as a concept, the County Councillors highway authority is satisfied with the merits er of a new settlement. I won't go any further, because I know there are other flags up rou round the room, Chairman. Ca can I say, I'm attempting to stick with two A er, I think I'll take Mr Grantham, and then we'll adjourn for lunch. But would you gentlemen who have flagged that you want to speak leave those flags up?\",\n",
       " \"Alright? Mr Grantham. Er, er, John Grantham, C P R E.\\nEr, sir, at the risk of straying slightly into into two B, you, do forgive me in advance, but you raised the specific point about size, and and erm there was er one or two statements that there isn't a a clear view on size in P P G three, I think it's important to to bear in mind the interrelationship between all P P G s and as Mr Curtis said, the research that that backs them up, and I I I point you to three quotes in the statement that C P R E have put in, erm i i i paragraph four point one seven,an and s the quote that attaches to that is taken from the research that erm er backs up draft revised P P G thirteen, transport, and erm I shall quote from that on this question of size,i it is also evident that smaller settlements, those with populations of less than fifty thousand, but particularly very small settlements are characteristically less transport emissions efficient than larger settlements, I think the the erm essence of of that particular piece of research is not as Mr Davis was implying to achieve totally self contained settlements, I don't believe such a concept exists, it's actually erm a planning land use in the long term to reduce C O two emi emissions something that is essential now to government policy, I think perhaps more instructive though is is the quote that I've in included in paragraph four point one nine and that's taken from er er this book here which I perhaps should submit the whole chapter in evidence to to the panel, I've only just included one quote, it's it's I suggest one of the more interesting reads that you may have as a result of this panel, it's by Colin Ward, and it's called New Town, Home Town, it's undertaken by er, sorry includes some of the work that's been undertaken by the University of Reading, erm and er David Lock Associates, on erm er new town research, and this this is due to be published by H M S O shortly, it's unfortunate that it wasn't available in time for this E I P, but I think erm, if you'll bear with me, I will read out the quote that I put in four point one nine, because I feel that it is useful on this question of of size, we concluded that if you are interested in environmental impact, energy conser consumption, and sustainability, new settlements have to reach a certain size to be worthwhile, it's parallel to the old arguments that used to take place around self containment in new towns, we found that new settlements of much less than five thousand houses, that's about fourteen thousand people are not really worthwhile because if they are smaller than that you are simply putting a housing estate in the countryside, a phrase that that has already been put round this morning, it appears that the best minimum for a new settlement, the best minimum, is about ten thousand houses, that's that's twenty five thousand people, which as it happens is about the size of the original garden cities. Starting from the logic of sustainability, we end up with a very similar size for a new community to the one that Howard was writing about a hundred years ago. I erm think that that is quite useful research that has been undertaken for government, and it it has been carried through, er as I'm sure everybody is aware, into the U K strategy for sustainable development, the consultation period of which is just concluding, erm I won't take you any more of the panel's time to read that quote as it's written in my in my statement. Yes, I I we have read it, we have read it. Er obviously, I mean the new towns movement as conceived immediately after the war was geared to meeting London housing needs, you know, we're not comparing like with like, but I think, I take the point that you are making in terms of er sustainability.\",\n",
       " \"Mr Spittle  \\nMr Spittle. to say something. Malcolm Spittle, County Councillor. I was very interested to read this quote from David Lock, erm of David Lock associates, and I just wonder how it squares from the fact that er Mr Lock associates submitted an objection to H two on the grounds they wanted a settlement of eighteen hundred dwellings to the North of York. Erm, it does seem to be something of a contradiction in terms there, and in fact Mr Lock isn't here today because his clients have subsequently withdrawn from the er E I P but er it would have been interesting to have asked him the question.

Er when you feel that you can't answer our questions in open session, if you could indicate that then we will go into closed session at the end of the morning and cover that ground in that way. Understood. Looking first of all then at the operational performance of the aircraft, you have told us already in written answers that in the light of the changed security situation you have relaxed the Eurofighter requirement. Can you tell us an indication of how much the changes reduce operational capability in percentage terms? Erm well perhaps before I answer that question Mr Chairman, I could just briefly skim across the programme and bring you up to date as to where we are and then we'll go directly on to that point.\",\n",
       " \"Very briefly  would . Yes, very brief . Er well the committee will recall that shortly after  it published its report in Spring ninety two, the new German Minister of Defence  questioned whether the project was still required at that degree of sophistication. For our part we had no doubt about the continuing need for an aircraft of Eurofighter two thousand's broad capabilities. This view was subsequently confirmed  by a thorough review of the operation requirement which was carried out under the direction of the four chiefs of defence staff. The review of the requirement and the options for meeting it er culminated in an agreement between the four ministers of defence in December ninety two to re-orientate er the project. We provided a note to the committee in January ninety three about this. Well, re-orientation of the project has involved a line by line review of the European staff requirement, the E S R D  to see whether it might be relaxed in the light of the changed international security situation. It also involves rescheduling the whole programme so that decisions on commitments to production can be deferred until nineteen ninety five, with first deliveries to United Kingdom and Italy occurring in the year two thousand and to er Spain and Germany in two thousand and two. Work by the staffs in the four ministries of defence and by the NATO agency N A F M A to re-orientate the project in line with the minister's directions is now at an advance stage. The revised European staff requirement document has been signed now by the four chiefs of air staff, this was done last month. A revised schedule for the development programme  has now been agreed with industry and this will be taken into the contract. The four governments are also resolved to cap their financial liabilities for this programme. So negotiations are in progress on revised prices for the development phase. These have taken somewhat longer than we anticipated but we are at last making good progress towards agreeing prices for the Eurojet contract and we are expecting to receive more acceptable price quotations from Eurofighter very shortly for their part of the work. The changes to the programme also require a new memorandum understanding with our partners. The draft for this is almost complete  but it can't be finalised until the costs of the revised programme have been agreed for each of the participating nations. All being well this new M O U will be ready for submission to ministers by the middle of this year. Turning now to the development work itself  in general, the development work is going well. There have been no fundamental technical problems. There has been a very considerable delay to the first flight but this is now scheduled for April this year. The delay has been due mainly to the need to be absolutely certain about the integrity of the flight control system software before the aircraft takes to the air. While  the delay to the start of the flying programme has been much longer than anyone would wish, much more progress has been made in the ground and rig testing than at the comparable stage of any previous project I have been associated with  and we are very satisfied indeed with the results that have been obtained so far. There is  assessment in the wind tunnels, for example, is complete and the results are good. The structural test programme  is also making extremely good progress and the results from the engine test programme are ex very encouraging indeed. The performance of the engine, on the bench, already meets its full specification for thrust and fuel efficiency and even it exceeds it slightly in some respects. So overall we remain very confident that the Eurofighter two thousand will meet the full operational requirement. So now turning to the point which er I think you asked us to address. Can we quantify, or explain, the areas in which we have made some relaxation and I'll ask Group Captain Granville White to answer that. Well the specific question I asked is whether you've quantified in percentage terms  erm perhaps Group Captain  you could give us an indication of how it has affected it? Yes certainly, yes. The point about er relaxations and what impact it would have on its combat capability. I think the important point I'd like to make at the outset is that when the review of the requirement was carried out it was carried out both nationally and on a four nation basis, the ministers, once that was complete, the ministers decided that and stated publicly in December ninety two, that  we will continue with the existing airframe and engine combination and that each nation er based on a family of aircraft concept could decide from a menu which equipments it would fit according to their individual requirements and their budget and  we looked individually at each of the items to see what impact it would have on the operational capability if we were to remove them and what erm was decided in the end and the requirement reflects this, was signed last month by the Chief Surveyor's staff, is that some nations have decided to remove certain items of equipment but for the U K we felt that it was necessary to keep all the major items and therefore as far as the U K is  erm impact on the operational requirement is concerned, there is no significant alteration in its operational capability and therefore in overall percentage terms there is no  decrease in the capability at all. Now individual nations who've decided  to do without a particular item of equipment, clearly that will be developed into the aircraft and therefore they have the option to  if they wish to d decide  later on to fit it in. Thank you. I'll  I think at least four particular areas where the United Kingdom has decided not to, as it were, take the full specification. Er, can we have a look at those or or at least, has accepted specific changes to those specifications. Can we have a look at  those four and if you could, I'd be grateful if you can tell me what change in the security situation, as envisaged by the government, has led to our acceptance of those changes. Now the first one, which was mentioned by the minister in the R A F debate, er is the reduced requirement to operate on damaged runways. What change of perception in the security situation has led to our accepting that diminution of capability. Yes the there are two aspects really to that, one is the length of runway operating  er and the other is the surface, erm, if I could take the first one. When the requirement was originally written erm and agreed in nineteen eighty seven  all of the nations decided that erm we required a short take off and landing capability and that was based on the  sort of the then cold war situation where the prospects of  runways and airfields being very severely damaged in a sort of central European type of scenario, and therefore the possibility that there might be only very small operating strips available from those runways and that was the basis for the particular length that was decided at the time. Because of the changed security situation and that type of er conflict not being envisaged in the same way now, what we felt was important was to be able to operate er apart from main operating bases, but also from sort of general purpose erm strips, flying clubs and those type of smaller airfields and therefore rather than looking at the damaged runway situation, we looked at the smaller strips and took a length that we could sensibly operate from  erm and took that as the yardstick but clearly  notwithstanding that, there is the prospect of damaged runways and therefore the slight relaxation would also apply to damaged runways but perhaps damaged to a lesser extent. I think perhaps if I just add a point to that er although we have as four nations  agreed on the revised requirement there, I believe it's true to say that development has progressed to such an extent that probably we will have the original requirement in practice, even though we've no longer specified it. That's very encouraging. For no extra charge. Can we then look at the reduced engine thrust  erm this presumably would have a significant impact on combat performance, er why is there any change in the  security situation that would warrant such a a relaxation? Yes the particular item that was deleted was known as the combat override facility which erm was really a trade off erm  to provide extra thrust against the reduced life of the engine and clearly if one operates at the top end of the engine  spectrum in er  hotter conditions and higher er R P M then clearly the life of the engine will be reduced. Now we had originally had this extra facility available er so that we could trade off life against the extra thrust in an emergency but there was clearly the possibility erm that that might be used er when it really wasn't necessary and we would end up with extra  costs, extra life cycle costs, shorter engine life and it was felt on balance that with a reduced threat overall that it was sensible to take out that facility and to accept  a longer engine life, but not, there's no reduction in the total normal thrust but its merely its override combat facility. I it doesn't speak very highly if I may say so Group Captain, for R A F discipline if what you're telling me and telling the committee that you think that pilots should be using this facility, would be using this facility when they're ordered not to. No I wasn't suggesting that Mr Chairman. Well why would it be used in circumstances when it was not needed otherwise? I was only thinking really of erm  particularly extreme situations erm  and I would expect it to be used for example in normal training or anything like that and er certainly all the studies show that the normal thrust, full thrust that was available was sufficient to meet the threat and this extra capability really was a a sort of  an extra that was added in early on and really wasn't felt on any of the combat modelling to be necessary. I think I would actually like to pursue that point Group Captain but I I think I'd rather pursue it in in the closed session than an open session. Now can we move on to the reduced quantities of role equipment. Can you tell us what  role equipment items have been deleted. Yes, it was not so much a deletion as er a reduction in the numbers because we were very mindful erm in  going through the requirement erm and not making significant changes as far as the U K was concerned and we needed to make some savings in cost if at all possible and therefore we carried out a very comprehensive review of all the items of role equipment such as drop tanks er pylons, explosive release units and those type of things which  had been  provisionally earmarked for a very high intensive and fairly long running conflict and it was felt that if we were to make some savings then it was a sensible balance to reduce those numbers on the basis that we could save some money in the programme but at the same time many of these items could be bought later on at relatively short notice, clearly not within a conflict but in the years to come. on that point. Erm  as far as the drop tanks are concerned, does that have any impact on the range or are you just talking about the numbers that you will have  spare? They're purely on on the numbers, the same er stand, the different sizes would still be available, there would merely be fewer of them in total stocks. But would you envisage that the numbers er of aircraft actually kitted out with these things have been reduced  or are you talking about having spares in case they get lost or damaged? No the the very name, as the name implies, in many cases we would er jettison the drop tanks before entering combat and er therefore there is an agreed rate at which we would expect to use them so that they are a a usable stock in operations   . and in training presumably  do you drop them in training or do you not? No, not normally, no. So it's only operational. Yes. And can you give an indication of how quickly these things could be ordered  in an emergency? Perhaps I can take that one er Group Captain. Once the  erm drop tanks have been developed and have entered production  in most of the lead time one associates with providing a capability has er has actually been avoided so we could re-order probably within a year. Very reassuring Mr Gordon, I, we're not necessarily gonna have a year's warning that that we're going to need these aircraft in the event of war. Well, that of course er may be true but er  as the Group Captain has has said here in the reduced  er  spec position which we now face and judgement was taken as to how much we should invest in stocks of reserve drop tanks at this point and the option exists to order more. Can I ask  it's absolutely meaningless to me, do you mean a month, three months, nine months, eleven months, eleven and a half months, what do you mean? No what I mean is that er  once the item is in production  if you wish to order another hundred drop tanks or another thousand drop tanks  if you make that order then approximately one year later you would receive deliveries of those tanks against that order. Now that would be the normal peacetime lead time if we could  accelerate that in industry and find some way of doing it then it may well be possible to do in quicker time than that. So in approximately one year you might be fourteen months or fifteen months? I  I'm er quoting a hypothetical situation here that we have entered production with er production line for drop tanks maybe producing two, three thousand tanks against a projected usage for the next ten years and sometime during that period we decide you want to order an additional thousand tanks  two thousand tanks then you could adjust the rate at which the deliveries occur, you could adjust the the the total quantity and with about a years notice industry can get in the materials and produce the goods for you. Does that answer your question? If er there was a crisis and there was a need for a rush order  er one would be talking of  weeks for something that is predesigned to start coming off the production line. experience during the Falklands war and during Gulf war indicated that once an item was in production  tremendous acceleration is possible in the real war situation. Yes. I was discussing a year for a normal peacetime lead time. Presumably drop tanks aren't  lost very often in peace time, it's  operations that you've actually jettisoned, is that right? That is absolutely right, correct. Bruce George. Thank you,i do you feel a little uneasy at changing operational requirements based on er  an assessment of a threat in nineteen ninety two, ninety three, which I presume would have to remain valid until two thousand and twenty. So how confident are you that potential adversaries will not have the capability in two thousand and twenty to make a mess of our runways as the Soviets would have done during the er the cold war? Erm I'm asking this question to e satisfy myself that these changes and reduction in costs are not the result of political expediency as opposed to er a genuine  assessment of what the risk in the change environment is likely to be. fine. That is precisely the background to the study which was conducted by the four chiefs of defence staff, they were asking that kind of question and I'll now ask the Group Captain to respond. Yes er I think perhaps the point I'd like to emphasis is that the increase er in runway length is really quite a modest one  er and therefore it hasn't had an enormous impact. Well  the answer is yes but of course landing and taking off on a road is one thing, being able to operate is another one because clearly one needs er fuel, weapons, ground crew and the like but landing on a road in itself is is not difficult. Peter \\nMy I move to er questions about the er comparison between the erm Eurofighter and other  fighters it might find itself in combat with. Well Peter I'm sorry but the notice only said once,Winston is meant to lead us into that I'm sorry.\",\n",
       " \"Right I'm sorry . Winston Churchill. When you updated er the combat analysis using the latest data on Eurofighter  did you again compare er Eurofighter with alternatives such as an updated F sixteen or F fifteen er previous combat modelling showed that an alternative aircraft er  apart from the F twenty two, did not approach the capability of Eurofighter. Did the latest modelling confirm this and what is the next best alternative in terms of capability. Right, Group Captain Granville White. Yes wh when they reported to the committee two years ago erm I explained that there was combat modelling going on at at the time and indeed that was completed by the end of nineteen ninety two and it showed  that er of all the alternatives available then Eurofighter two thousand was the most cost effective solution to the R A F's requirements and yet it would it would not be able to meet up er to the F twenty two but other than that it was superior to all other aircraft. At the moment erm  because of the extra time we've got available because production investment has been delayed because of ministerial decisions, we've set in train three further studies and they will look collectively at alternatives, comparison in combat modelling and also in the  numbers  and if I could describe those three very briefly because I think they're the they're relevant to what we're talking about. The  the two, initially there are two studies which will look into numbers, one of those is a top downs study which is based on scenarios and will look at erm a variety of different situations around the world from an analytical point of view. The second one is erm a bottom up study which is based on today's commitments but projecting them forward into the timescale in which we will have the aircraft and looking in that way to see how many and and in what way we would need them. The third one focusing in specifically on the combat modelling is what is known as a C O E I A which is a combined operational effectiveness and investment appraisal and this work is being carried out at Farnborough and we're comparing in single roles and multi-role Eurofighter two thousand against different aircraft. So for example, in the specialist air defence er side we're looking  at alternatives would be the F twenty two  erm the current tornado F three and also an upgraded variant of the F three. In the ground attack side we're comparing it to the jaguar that it'll replace, the harrier G R seven and also the tornado G R four and then in the multi-role arena for air defence, air superiority and attack we're comparing our aircraft against the French Raphall the American F eighteen E which is the the future variant of the F eighteen, the F fifteen E, the multi-role  but primarily air to surface machine and also the F sixteen C. Those are the ones we're currently looking at. As the cost of  Eurofighter increases does there come a point where like the F twenty two i it becomes unaffordable and by how much would the performance of Eurofighter have to be degraded before it becomes equivalent to the nearest alternative? I wonder if I could answer that in a in a different way because clearly rather there's the option, rather than reduction the operational capability which was really the er  initiative that  had begun in nineteen ninety two, there is the option of course of er adjusting the total numbers and that would er have an overall bearing on the total programme cost but cert because certainly the judgement of the er  the chiefs of staff was that er as far as the U K was concerned then we we should retain the operational capability as I explained earlier an n and not decrease it in any significant extent because if we did that then we could end up er with an inferior capability against a potential threat. During the last year erm when we were working on the requirement, we carried out a number of erm comparisons descoping or aircraft in various respects. For example taking out the forward looking infra-red, infra-red search and track, taking out the the M I D S, the multiple information distribution system and certain aspects of the er defensive aids, to see what impact that would have and we found that if we removed any one of those  erm then we would either come down to parity against potential threat or possibly er inferiority and that was really the supporting evidence to retain the full capability. But Group Captain are you saying that as er a platform it has not been degraded at all, there's basically no change in thrust, in turn rate or  in airframe G loading? Yes, that's correct.\",\n",
       " \"Thank you. Peter was your question answered or not? No in the air superiority role I didn't hear a comparison with the S U thirty five or the Fulcrum M E twenty nine S er are there any other aircraft of er perhaps comparable capacity with which you did not compare Eurofighter? What we've done,won one of the points I think  that is worth er making perhaps is that on er over the last few years we've seen a complete change in world export philosophy where not only are the Russians exporting all over the place but clearly  er there are a number of western aircraft in different parts of the world and therefore what we have also done is to, in comparing  er our aircraft against other western ones, we've also looked at them  as potential threats because it's possible that er  erm western aircraft in certain hands could end up being used against us so we have also compared those. But the question that young pilots would want  to know the answer to is this, erm are there aircraft anywhere in the world with which you have not made a comparison in terms of air superiority? No, there are none. So you have compared with the  \\nAnd the S U? Yes we've compared with everything and specifically the ones you've mentioned, the S U  thirty five and the  which is an upgraded S U twenty seven and the M I G twenty nine S, yes we've specifically compared against those two.\",\n",
       " \"And you've been reassured by the responses? Yes. Thank you Chairman. Thank you, Michael Colgan\\nYes Mr Chairman I'm not clear  erm about something that Mr Gordon said in his opening remarks that I'd like clarified and that is that he  gave the committee the impression that there were  er certain of the  of the partners  that were accepting  erm a lower specification in other words, omitting  from the  what is the British best if you like, erm certain items of of equipment in order to reduce cost of the aircraft, both in development stage and at the production stage, final cost of the aircraft, unit cost. Erm  we asked the question about   the aircraft's reduced operational capabilities as far as Britain is concerned, we were told that there was no reduction, erm  there was no percentage figure that could be produced but w now what about the other countries, I mean, which countries are asking for what to be omitted  and  by how much is the percentage, in percentage terms er is the performance of the aircraft reduced in those cases and further on from that, picking up something that that Wing Com er Group Captain Granville White has just mentioned which i is the question of sales. Yes. Erm  it does obviously have a bearing on sales to the third countries  when the er aircraft is in production. Do I get the impression that we're basically building a  a basic aircraft  with optional extras, or are we building an aircraft which can be, to some degree, sanitised because obviously there are  some parts of the specification of the aircraft we may not wish third cra countries to have. It's a well known fact that  aircraft are sold all around the world, this can have  a bearing on the  capability and also  a bearing on their cost and therefore  saleability. Perhaps, from those remarks, it's hardly a question but perhaps you could just clarify\\nYes. my er thinking on on the  on what you said in opening remarks which don't make it clear to me  whether we've got a basic aircraft with optional extras or a fully specified aircraft from which we can dat deleted certain items of equipment. Erm, well  I think I can reassure that it is the latter. The development programme for the aircraft will provide  the broad range of capabilities which was asked for by all four nations originally and er the fact that one or more nations may have deleted its requirement for a particular facility doesn't remove the need for us to complete the development work  er because we still have at least one or two customers for that facility. So it's definitely the latter, we are developing a fully capable Eurofighter two thousand aircraft  and  if erm  any of our four participating nations do not want a particular facility then we will make provision for them to leave that out in production  and if an export customer does not require the full range of capabilities we can also remove them for that export customer. But by how much could we degrade the aircraft and still be capable of  erm competing with erm other aircraft in in the market? Well I I I would prefer to perhaps follow this one up in the closed session later but erm. we we'll pursue that er in private. Neville Trotter. going to go into service in the next century, it's going to be around till well into the next century. Very briefly what would it do that the present generation of aircraft won't, how is it a quantum leap ahead? Fine, I will again invite the the Group Captain to answer that. Perhaps I could er answer that in er  I think there are  probably four points that er come out to my mind  erm  the first one in the airframe engine combination, a very high degree of agility. The ability to be able to pull nine G which is er generally accepted to be the physiological limit for pilots, which is more than any of our aircraft can  . What can we do now by contrast? Er, none of our aircraft can pull more than seven G, normal aircraft. There's also a close correlation by not just the  erm the size of the number for G, but how long can it go on pulling that G given the thrust and the aerodynamic capabilities of the machine  and we are essentially building this aircraft so that it can sustain nine G  and we are providing the pilot with the sort of equipment he requires to be able to survive in that kind of environment. Is this for a dog fight?\",\n",
       " \"Yes, yes. . Th it has er a considerable negative G capability as well. Would it be able, er pulling that erm G  to compete with the with the harrier using the  technique? Erm Group Captain Granville White. The simple answer is yes. Er so I think the first of my four points is the is the airframe agility, clearly the the ability to m manoeuvre. The second erm  is is and perhaps is related in a way  er in the air to air weapons where  erm  in older missiles have had  what is known as sort of bore sight capability where they go in the direction of the aircraft. Clearly to have the combination of an off bore sight capability for a  a missile such as A S R A A M, the er advance short range air to air missile, the combination of the agility of the weapon and the flat platform together has been shown to be really needed, you can't have one without the other and that somebody who has only agility in the aircraft or agility in the in the weapon, will lose against somebody who has it in both. So I think that's the  probably the sort of related point. Moving on into the sort of sensors and the electronics side, erm  for survivability  erm  the defensive aid sub- system will be  er very complex, very sophisticated but also integrated so that it has a complete system of protection for the aircraft, erm  an and  finally moving on on the sort of electronics side then clearly with different sensors such as the radar, the forward looking infra-red, infra-red search and track  the er multiple information distribution system and also certain aspects of the er  electronic warfare suite then by having sensor fusion which enables the best information at any one time to be  correlated into the system as a whole then that will provide a very  good capability and far in excess of anything that we have at the moment. Thank you very much. I'll ask  Campbell to take us on into the question of the role of this aircraft. We understand that some new weapons, not previously in the specification, are to be included. Are you able to tell us in open session what sort of weapons are envisaged? Erm perhaps I can  invite my colleague from the  office of management and budgets to  speak to that one. Erm chairman yes we hope to  to erm, excuse me, to erm that E four will be capable of  er sorry E F two thousand will be capable of handling all our  erm planned weapons er which are already in our programme  the er  conventional er, the C A S O M, the conventionally armed, stand-off missile, the er anti- armour missile er twelve thirty eight and the future medium range air-to-air missile  er whatever that happens to be er as a result of er competition. What about the low level laser guided bomb, is that also included in this? Yes it is. Erm  does the fact of erm  using the aircraft to er provide a platform for these systems, er tell us something about  a change in view about the role or operating concept of the aircraft? Erm Group Captain Granville White . thank you Erm  not not change erm  with envisagement . Widen \\nWi certainly broaden, we've we've envisaged from the outset that the aircraft would be  both will be multi- role capable and that erm all  that the primary design driver will be the air-to-air air superiority role but the air-to-surface role would be almost an equal, clearly one has to have a a prioritisation and those particular weapons in the air-to-surface side, the conventional armed stand off missile along the low level er low level laser guided bomb and the future anti armour weapon, they clearly erm  really take the weaponeering side into the next century. We will still have the ability  to carry today's weapons such as the  the L seven five five cluster bomb unit, the thousand pound bomb  erm and the C R V seven rocket and things like that but clearly as we move forward into the century it's important that as the  platform progresses then so does the aircraft. Are the any weapons er which the aircraft er would not be able to , for example the J P two three three closely associated with the tornado, er is that a system which you would anticipate  Eurofighter two thousand to be able to carry? No, it it's too large and too heavy and really that is a different role that's more the role for the  tornado G L one, G L four. And I think you mentioned thousand pounds bombs. Yes. Is that the, is that the limit  could anything heavier than that  \\nIt's , no it's not the limit er the limit of weight, it can carry er heavier ones.\",\n",
       " 'You may not wish to say in open session . I think probably as you  .',\n",
       " \"in closed session. Yes, it's probably more appropriate. Erm I was rather interested by the comparisons which you explained a little earlier in the evidence  erm  if you've got an aircraft which is er going to replace, as I understand it the Jaguar and the Phantom which has already been retired,er against which you've been comparing the F three er and the G R four  of the tornados and the harriers, then er that gives rise in my mind to the possibility that this is an aircraft which might replace all of these, in which case will that have consequences for the still  er publicly declared intention to order two hundred and fifty, might we order more for example? Mr Evans. Erm  as you say Mr Campbell er the plan at the moment is that the F two thousand will replace jaguar and the tornado A D V F three aircraft and the scope er of replacing other aircraft er remains under consideration, er provisional off take of two fifty er was declared at the d the start of the development phase and of course our work share in development is based on that number. Before we seek authorisation for the production phase, it will be necessary for each nation to restate or modify it's planned off take and that will be done very firmly on the basis of the studies which er Group Captain Granville White has already d described which will  factor in er  against our military tasks, which is,y you know we define now fairly clearly, er exactly what aircraft are needed to undertake those tasks in what scenarios  and in the future  er as you say, there may well be scope for er adding additional aircraft types to that. Well I think I  understand that answer to be an affirmative, that if  this aircraft is capable of replacing, if you like, the suite of aircraft we've been discussing, then er that may well result in orders for more than two hundred fifty. It could do because obviously there are a number of other considerations, not least affordability er within the defence programme which erm from my point of view is a very important consideration. But of course if one wants to continue to have the capability into the next century, which the present er range of aircraft provides, er  then Eurofighter two thousand may be the only available platform for those purposes. Indeed and I think the er the point about Eurofighter is that it's a very flexible er aircraft, it's a multi-role aircraft, it's a cost effective aircraft and therefore it er, as you say, may well be able to cover quite a large spectrum. Can I ask you about er the medium range surface to air missile because er, you won't be surprised to learn, that er the committee's received a number of  submissions  on this matter  er which suggest that er  er t to proceed with Eurofighter two thousand without the medium range surface to air missile er  I mean to be put rather bluntly to us, that it makes little sense to proceed with the aircraft without a replacement for blood hound. What's your response to that? Well I think perhaps I can start that and the Group Captain may want to come in. Er I think our position is that we provide as you know, air defence through a layered system er of air defence aircraft and missiles  and the simple truth is that in the light of the changes in the strategic  er setting, particularly er as it affects U K air defence, we have decided that the provision of a medium defensive layer, that is the M sound system to which you refer, is not a high priority at the moment and the programme is therefore being postponed and I have to emphasise it's not been abandoned. Well erm if I were then to ask you when  what was your best estimate to when the programme  was likely to be commenced. I fancy you would not be able to give me any more precise an answer than one you've just given, isn't that right? Well programmers tend not to be precise in this, in this kind of er context er Mr Campbell. But certainly we  er as I said, the essential point is that we are looking, looking at the capability  across the board and taking into account the strategic requirement as we see it in terms of the direct threat to the U K in particular, which is obviously  dramatically declined as a result of the collapse of the Warsaw pact. We believe that certainly for the time being, the combination of the fighter aircraft and rapier  will provide an acceptable level er of air defence with a much reduced air threat to the U K er which now exists. We will continue to look at  er the future programme er we will also as you know, look at ballistic missile  defence which is another  element to this and that must need to be fact facted in as well but I think clearly we are not talking about in the medium term  er and longer term, we are talking about er a fairly late stage of the programme. I mean how do you protect  Eurofighter two thousand in the absence of  the medium range surface to air missile  on the, I think you you told us about er  the aircraft themselves as it were providing their own protection but what else? Well as I've said we we have as you say y y yourself, you have the aircraft itself, you have the er  the existing er air defence aircraft, you have rapier  and in in our view, er in certainly in terms of the U K's threat er that is er an acceptable er er suite of preventative measures in the light of the threat which we now have. I think I have to  make the point to you that we  are planning to roughly double  the size of the er airforce equipment programme er between now and the end of the century, a very substantial chunk of that is E F two thousand and its er associated weapon systems and, you know, one has to frankly, take er a view on priorities er in the light of the strategic requirement and given the  er extent of the threat as we see it, the possibility of using  er of taking part in out of area operations in coalitions, that kind of thing, that was the judgement we took er the medium term priorities were such that we couldn't afford the first er stage of A M S A M.\\nW was that decision to any extent er influenced by, if I can put it rather er ineptly, the state of blood hound when it was taken out of service. Well as you know I think the committee looked at this erm in nineteen ninety one and er  I think it is fairly true to say that by the time it was taken out of service blood hound did not represent a very high level of capability  erm and the gap, there is a gap obviously between blood hound it'll it'll now be a rather longer gap between that and any A M S A M replacement, er but blood hound itself was judged to be frankly not worth having. I remember Mr Alan Clarke who was then minister of responsibility saying rather elliptically in the house of commons that the removal of blood hound did nothing to degrade Britain's air defence. I would not wish to disagree with Mr Clarke. Well I wouldn't offer that as a general er proposition. Neither would I actually, in this particular case . perhaps we should  confine it to the specifics we're talking. One last matter please erm, so far as I understand that  you've not yet drafted the separate staff requirement for reconnaissance, I beg you pardon, reconnaissance equipment for Eurofighter two thousand. Are you able to tell us what the timescale of that is? Perhaps I can ask Group Captain? Yes. of the four nations in the programme, the U K is the only one that has a requirement for reconnaissance. Erm, and at the moment we are carrying out some studies which er are nearing completion, to decided exactly what the  R A F's future requirements are for tactical reconnaissance. As that work comes to  er fruition, the staff target will be drafted and in fact work is already begun on that, erm but because the reconnaissance capability won't be required until  fairly late in the replacement programme then  there is no particular hurry to get on with the work. What we hope to be able to do is to  complete the requirement  the staff target this year and set in train some industrial studies to see what the various options are and then once we enter the production investment phase then that would be the time that we would er look to doing the development work. Are these costs included in the overall estimates which have been given to us  f for the reconnaissance. reconnaissance. Er, yes indeed they are. They are  many thanks, thank you. Neville Trotter. from what you've told us, it would be possible for this aircraft to be so multi mission it could replace the whole of the front line er R A F fast jet strain, could that be true? Group Captain. I I think the  the the point I would I wish to make is that in  whilst er its multi role capability would have enabled it to replace a number of roles and possibly a number of er aircraft and er as Mr Evans said earlier, that's still being looked at. The one role that it won't be able to carry out is, as we were talking earlier, about the er J P two three three, runway denial weapon and also er nuclear. So that that,those two roles er clearly cannot be covered by it. I I was also thinking o of Veestol and and er the weapons going on and the mistakes anyway on on the developing a harrier replacement, is the R A F still interested in that as a feature  a short take-off  vertical take-off? I think the R A F would would clearly be interested in in keeping in touch with what's going on there, of course the states themselves er the picture is not entirely clear er about er what kind of types are going to emerge in the longer term but we would certainly wish to keep a a close view on what was going on and of course there is a Navy dimension to to the harrier replacement as well. Coming back to what you said about the load carrier, we are supposed to no longer be in the nuclear game in the airforce, isn't that right  coming out of the nuclear role? So that would no longer be a consideration. I think I think erm it's a question, Mr Trotter, it's the long range penetrator I think which erm is is the distinction, it's the ability to get through low level, longer range and carrying greater level of ordnance than either  . Wh what about er runway lengths, obviously depends on what it's carrying but er how how does it compare with existing aircraft for that? Erm, it's very much shorter because as we were saying earlier on the the short take off and landing capability, erm  with er I'd prefer to talk about distances perhaps in the closed session but the er the simple answer is very much . Only one crew member with all the technology in the world, some of us still think that it's a comfort to have somebody in the back watching the systems. Well that particular subject of course is er  er still a matter which is discussed  with great heat er in the crew rooms all over the Royal Air Force. Especially the navigators. Exactly and er  we are buying er a two seat version of this aeroplane  er our two seat version is aimed primarily at operational training  but er we have examined er time and again whether we believe the er  the  integration of the avionics which is possible in this aeroplane and which is planned for this aeroplane  er is  going to be able to reduce the pilot work load to such an extent that one man can comfortably do the job  and we have arrived at the conclusion that he most certainly can. The er  work which has preceded  at er British Aerospace  in the  the cockpit, to bring together all the information, displays and controls  erm has been  tested on er a team of eighteen pilots from, drawn from the four nations, to see whether they believe they can cope with that sort of pilot work load in in simulated operations and they're content that this kind of  cockpit is ideally suited for the task and they can cope. So we are convinced that it is er a cheap one. What about spare aircraft. Do you set out the sum, er you must set out some calculation of how many you are likely to to lose over the life of the aircraft, is there a percentage figure you could give us for that? Erm, Mr Evans er  will reply to that, obviously we we do plan for certain  levels. Yes  I think it's fair to say at the moment that, that, that is being looked at Mr Trotter, together with er the broader range of issues on the er  the operating concept er for E F two thousand but it is of course standard practice to buy not just the number you need for the front line but to buy sufficient aircraft to keep that front line in field for about twenty five, thirty years, whatever the life of the aircraft happens to be, taking account of er attrition, taking account of training requirements and engineering needs  and support needs and all that kind of thing and all that work  er is, has been done, is being done at the moment and er final figures will be put to that in in due course. Thank you, Mr Colgan. Mr  erm bearing in mind it its multi role capability and the fact that the U K is likely to be engaged in more and more out of air operations in support of U N er has any consideration been given to a maritime variant. Would that be er a practical thing to do or would you have to start redesigning a new aircraft? Er by maritime variant do you . I mean from air, to fly from aircraft carriers. The short answer is no. Not at this stage. Is that because of technical difficulties, or for some other reason. Erm er it's basically that there is no stated requirement at present from any of the four nations, for this aircraft to operate on ships  er back in the early days of the programme when the the French were involved  er we looked at the possibility of designing an aircraft er to provide the whole spectrum of capabilities from air defence  er ground attack and also maritime operations off ships  and er we we certainly experienced some difficulties in reconciling all those things in one design, which was adequately capable in each of the areas. Thank you  Campbell. There's an ambiguity I suspect it it's a in my mind rather than yours about the nuclear role, did I understand you to say that Eurofighter two thousand would not have  the capability of carrying for instance the W E one seven seven, we know that the  is not going to be er taken any further according to recent announcement but  will Eurofighter two thousand have the capacity to carry W E one seven seven? No that demonstrated the point I was making, it will not. So it, in the absence of the Tasm and in the absence of the capability then it's not gonna have a nuclear role.\",\n",
       " 'No.',\n",
       " \"Thank you very much. Winston Churchill. Would there not be  merits er at least putting in the requisite wiring  in case at a future date, that a C A S O M for instance, became dual capable? Er, perhaps I could make er  one comment, maybe Mr Gordon will ma wish to make a a technical comment on it, but certainly when we began the programme and we discussed with the other nations in the early stages of of the collaboration. erm  It was really one of the guidelines, it was the, if we considered doing that then I don't think we would have had a four nation programme or certainly a five nation programme at the start, I don't think we would've er stayed together, it was really one of the basic requirements not to have that capability. But is it not an add on capability er to a large degree if the basic wiring is there? I think we'd find Mr Churchill that it it's rather more complex than that and and the  requirements for delivering a nuclear weapon and you refer to the possibility of  C A S O M being nuclear capable, one has to be  fairly careful quite a, there's a degree of difference between a missile needed to do  the two jobs  and I think it would be rather more than wiring which would be er at issue here, there's the payload and all the rest of it which I suspect would cause very severe problems  with that. Er well we always start  from what does the operator of this aircraft want to use it for. This E S R D really is the bible and we have specified the aircraft to meet that E S R D and not anything extra, er  obviously if  one of the four nations wants to build a nuclear role into the aircraft that becomes a very big political question  first and foremost and we have just not considered it at the technical level at all because it's er it's not in the requirement. Is it a big technical problem or is it  very straight forward. Er I don't think I'd wish to speculate in in open forum. It doesn't require a great bite of imagination to see that the Germans for example would have been extremely reluctant to have been involved in a four nation project with a nuclear capability available as part of it. Well I I I wouldn't er  pin point the German attitude on this one, I mean after all we did collaborate with Germany very successfully on the tornado which has a nuclear role  but the the four governments must first of all decide if that is what we want to build into this aeroplane and they decided that they did not at that stage.\",\n",
       " 'I stand corrected.',\n",
       " \"Fine. If I just er end this  this particular item in two brief questions. From what you said about reconnaissance equipment it rather sounds to me as if the tornado D R one A is likely to be replaced by  in this reconnaissance role. Is that right? I think as a Group Captain er explained y'know the  the operational staff have really got to complete their study into what kind of tactical reconnaissance capability they want in the next century. The D R one A is currently an excellent er tactical reconnaissance aircraft, all weather, at night etcetera  and er it will go on well into the next century so there's no great hurry to to make a decision er one of the first points has gotta be decided is whether we carry the reconnaissance equipment in a pod under the aircraft replacing some of the other weapons or whether we try to build it in and er  but taking first things first we have to get the requirement sorted out. Thank you and as far as the jaguar's concerned I noted that the jaguar is not being phased out now until two thousand and four, that being a three year further delay. Is that related to the delay in  production  dates? Erm, Mr Evans. Er no I don't think it is  Mr Chairman. And do we know what the reasoning behind it is . Well we do or we'd, it had already been envisaged that er the jaguars would run out at er roughly that time. I think it was three years earlier though wasn't it? Well er  the  I mean there has been a slight complexity with the replacement er programme of course because er  er E F two thousand was originally envisaged that it would replace the phantoms er as as as as well as the jaguars and  now that er has altered with the decision in options to er get rid of er the phantom squadrons, we've er been able to adjust the replacement programme  such that er the aircraft  E F two thousand will replace er the erm er the jaguar and some of the F threes er and the programme will be adjusted such that we get er the most cost effective er mixture of replacement of those two types and there is no problem with  keeping the jaguar going until that stage  and it may well be it is, is being judged to be cheaper that we should er do some F three replacement at the same time, again partly for cost reasons because it's gonna be more cost effective to do it that way. like the jaguar really be able to go on that long given er that er there's an awful lot of errors in the Gulf apart from anything else. Well obviously that factor er  was considered carefully  by the Ministry of Defence before our Secretary of State agreed that we could  safely defer the in service date for Eurofighter two thousand and adjust the  the er replacement plan er back in December ninety two, so we have looked at what is the current rate of consumption of airframe life on the jaguar er what can be done  economically and sensibly to keep it flying safely and effectively into the next century and er we have come to the conclusion that we have a viable plan here which can tie up with the planned rate of delivery to service of Eurofighter two thousand. So are you gonna have to restrict training in er operational flights  jaguar at a stretch  just to stretch out the hours? We understand that that is not necessary but erm  my colleague may wish to. No . But it does sound  from what you're telling us now that it is actually directly related and to recall my original question, was it related to  programme to which I had the answer no, erm what you said  . Well I I apologise we're not trying to mislead you er Mr Chairman in any way. Clearly there is a connection, if Eurofighter two thousand was available earlier  then they the plan for replacing  er some of the aircraft in the R A F's front line er could be adjusted accordingly erm  but it's not a sort of direct one for one er if the  part of the programme slips a year the jaguar must go on an extra year because within the R A F's  overall plans for its er fleet replacement there is a certain degree of flexibility an and precisely which point the jaguars get replaced is er a judgement between them and their three. I think I know what you mean anyway, thank you. Neville Trotter\\nTwo er  requirements for the future that er seem to be er er desirable are stealth and what could be stealthier than the present generation of aircraft and secondly to prevent you having to go over your target you're likely to be shot down so that you need a stand up weapon capability, er  if the payload is somewhat limited can it still carry stand off weapons that are effective? Er, Group Captain. those yes, yes. Erm perhaps I could  would it, I wonder if you could just expand on stealth exactly what the er  \\nHave actually already covered them another time and I don't want to get deeper in the stealth now  than that, there's a limit on the time now available this morning. Can we deal with the weapon question, the stand off weapons. I can answer that very briefly Mr Chairman er yes, there will be the capability to carry stand off weapons the conventionally armed stand off missile for example will have a good stand off range. That will be carried by  . That will be carried and er  with a shorter range but the advanced anti armour weapon, that will also have a stand off capability and that will also be carried. go on into the development timescale and costs. Yes it's now going to take two years longer I think than was originally er contended, to what extent is this due to technical difficulties and to what extent is it due to one of our partners and Germany one's thinking of in particular, wishing to slow the programme down for fiscal reasons? Well erm it's a combination of both those factors er as I've mentioned at the outset  the development programme has moved ahead a little more slowly than we would wish, the main reasons for this were associated firstly with the delay in selecting equipment er and that took longer than our  contractor ha had imagined. Secondly the deliveries of the equipment from the equipment suppliers who had been selected er generally fell behind the promises which they had made, so the main reason for the technical delays has been lack of equipment of the correct standard to proceed with the integration programme  erm the  erm  the problems which beset the programme in nineteen ninety two after the German minister started questioning its future clearly had a direct bearing on that because many of the equipment suppliers, particularly those in Germany, suddenly began to think hey this programme is not going anywhere, why should we invest a lot of effort and and money into it and they slowed down so that has had a knock on effect in in terms of delaying the total programme and erm  the result of all of that has been that the current development programme schedule which we have supplied to the committee  is probably about as fast as the programme is capable of running. First flight still going to be in April? We are confident it will be in April, yes. And will that aircraft be less capable in its first flight than you'd originally hoped? Erm  it has always been planned that the  this er  release of the flight control system, will be phased through five steps and  the  capabilities at first flight are more or less what we had been planning er right from the outset. The cost is going to be some three thousand four hundred million I think to er to the U K. That's er gone up by about thirteen percent, four hundred million roughly, er over the original estimates, half of that is due to programme re-orientation because of the extension of the programme by two years as I understand it. Can you spell out what those costs are and are we having to pay more because Germany wants to slow the programme down? Perhaps I can ask Mr Perry to er fill in the details on costs? Yes. Erm Mr Trotter er that er apportionment of the four hundred and fifty million between er the effect of  programme re-orientation and other factors. Can I just say that I had figured four hundred million, it is in fact four fifty. Four fifty million sorry. Four fifty million, erm between programme re-orientation and other factors was an apportionment we made back in the er first half of nineteen ninety three and in the light of later information I think we would revise that now erm we  are still negotiating with the contractors on the revised contract price and we do not have definitive costs yet but in fact the  cost increase as a result of the rescheduling of the programme directly should be quite modest. There are some unavoidable costs er on that count, particularly on the engine programme where  delays to the aircraft programme which results in extra costs on the engine side are the customer's liability. Erm, but the  main increase in cost is actually in the equipment area  and results I think from  the fact that the equipment prices turned out to be higher than was originally estimated at the start of the programme and also the fact that U K industry won a higher work share on equipment than we had originally been entitled to and budgeted for and lastly the point you mentioned that Germany has withdrawn from some parts of the requirement and that made  certain equipments non common and we have had to take a larger share of the cost of those equipments than originally planned. Okay, can you spell out how our share of the cost has increased because our share of the work has increase. I thought that presumably the bill was still divided proportionately between the countries. No the, the bills are met by er on the territorial funding basis so basically we pay for the work done in the U K.\\nFrom which we will get the benefit presumably when production starts. In in in in er general terms, whether the production work sharing is. It is carried. those in favour. Aye. Those against.\",\n",
       " \"No. The ayes have it. Item six to report  social services committee  Mr \\nThen you turn your attention away in a minute and the rotten devils do \\nChairman, I I move  that the report of the social services committee regarding the future of the county council's old persons homes  be noted. I hope  Chairman that er David   will listen to the arguments on this because like other members of his group he throws out  closure of elderly persons homes, y'know we've gotta do it, we've gotta do it  something about which he knows absolutely nothing  and about which he's completely wrong. erm  I've always believed that consistency is an overrated virtue  so  I'm not gonna criticise the Conservatives for changing their minds but  you have to ask yourself why is this recorded on the agenda today  when  the sub-committee, planning sub- committee has already met and discussed these matters and things have moved on a little further  Well we  we really have to look at how the  resolution in this  paragraph came about in the first place. erm  At the beginning of the social services committee meeting Mr   moved a resolution which he previously moved at the social services planning sub-committee  which  listed most of the things which are presently in the  the resolution but it started the social services accept the implication of the director of social services report on the future of the department's elderly person's homes  erm, after some minutes of debate  the  er Democrats asked if the Tories would remove that  phrase from the resolution and then tha the Democrats, the Liberal Democrats would vote for it  the Tories of course er looking gift horses in the mouth as usual, said no  and  the the that  resolution was lost. We then  voted on a lengthy Liberal resolution  er, it was amended by Labour  we voted on  all of the separate points in the resolution, all were agreed  and then Professor  decided that he wanted to move a further amendment which after some consultation, some discussion with the legal people about it's validity, he did  which wiped out all of the things that we'd just agreed and we turned  to the original Conservative motion  minus the beginning phrase and with a couple of things stuck on at the end  and we thought well that's it the Conservatives will vote for that, but no  although it was their own motion  in all but name, the Conservatives wouldn't vote for that  unless Mr  was allowed to move it. So he did. So he did  and it was voted on and it was agreed. We spent  Chairman, two and a half hours discussing this matter at that point and we had come full circle  back to point 1. To get back to that beginning phrase  the  social services committee accepts the implications of the director of social services report on the future of the departments E P H's. That report predicted a rise from five hundred to nine hundred  er in the vacancies in in homes by nineteen ninety six. Since then at the planning sub-committee Mr  has produced a whole load of new made-up figures  which  pretend that the situation is far worse than that. Figures designed to get headlines  not make headway. The figures actually  which I got from the director yesterday  are that the department is counting four hundred and ten vacancies  of those four hundred and ten, two hundred and thirty four are out of commission, they're in homes being refurbished  seventy two are in blocked places, that is  double rooms being lived in by a widow or widower where er they'd previously shared it with the spouse  or er disability reasons, health reasons, behaviour reasons of a resident er  in a previously shared room. Purposes like that er which take out seventy two places. In fact  as of the first of this month, the number of real vacancies was a hundred and four  now today I've received another list of er so called vacancies  from the Leicestershire South area. As of the thirteenth of the ninth ninety three  I'll just read through one or two of these. Curtis Weston, no vacancies, one short stay vacancy. Demontfort, no vacancies. Endaby, two double rooms being used at single occupancy for Lental House residents, one shared female bed available. So on and so on in Leicestershire South  ten vacancies, seven short stay vacancies. So you can see Chairman  the facts and figures simply do not support either the report which came to  the social services committee originally or Mr  inflated figures. The true vacancies are a hundred and four across thirty eight homes, we're talking about two or three real vacancies per home. So Mr  talked in the debate about internal reorganisation about continuing to provide services for which there is an over provision and it berated me and the Labour group for that. Well the figures show that  assessments of the over provision are incorrect but  even had they been correct if circumstances were an over provision comes about not because of an increase in our provision of services, but because of expansion in the private sector. Are we supposed simply  to abdicate our responsibility and for every new place that's  started in the private sector, we close down a place in our er organisation. Is that what this is about, that  places can continue to spring up in the private sector and we must close our homes  in order to meet that demand not from elderly people for places but from the private sector for profits. Placements, April to August  a hundred and fifty nine in nursing homes, two hundred and eight in residential homes in all sectors. But, we know that April was a low figure, we also know that July and August are low  a figure which comes out from this graph  and was given to me by the director yesterday, is a genuine average which is turning out to be between a hundred and a hundred and ten placements per month  twelve hundred to fourteen hundred placements per year  a thr over a three year average residency period  three thousand six hundred to four thousand two hundred placements in residential care, where  then is the real problem. The problem is with the fact that seventy five to eighty percent of people are being directed towards the private sector  and only twenty to twenty five percent towards the public sector, yet  still the private sectors squeal. I've got here a copy of a letter  by Peter  spokesperson for care, a more misnamed organisation you couldn't wish to come across, a combined association of residential establishments. A letter to G P s.\\nDear doctor,we have noticed that as a result of a press article, copy enclosed, that there's been concern stressed by a number of general practitioners with regards the slowness of the social services controlled community care programme  as an association on behalf of our residential and nursing home members  we have been stating the same fact to social services who have basically denied the existence of any problem, although we hope that in the long term the social services will be able refine their system to be more efficient, as an interim measure we are offering you a direct line service. If you wish to effect a placement in a residential or nursing home  we hope for the time being it will help resolve your problem. This is an attempt  to circumvent the assessment process. They cannot of course do that, this letter described by the director of social services as a disgrace. No, people sitting across in the other benches saying of course they can are wrong. Of course they can't. People may put themselves into residential care if they wish  they will pay the whole of the bill. If they wish to be assessed as needing residential care and using public money then they have to go through the assessment process and be assessed as needing residential care. So  this letter which refers to our processes in this county council, it's talking about people who want to go into residential care and to use public money. All of that being said  and  Mr  will talk a bit more about the figures when he  comes to speak. People will no doubt be relieved to hear what has finally been included in the planning sub-committee resolutions. That homes already furbished or in the process of being refurbished or identified for refurbishment shall not be closed and will re-open as county council E P H s.\\nThat reassurance is essential  to residents, staff and to the community. That's what they desperately want to hear. We have also decided that we will look again at the costs of refurbishment. That we will seek to refurbish  the homes which will cost least to refurbish, first. That way  we will achieve more in the period and for the money that is available. That will leave us, presumably at the end of this process with  some of the worst homes, which we will then have to decide  what to do about. So  although the Labour group will be moving a reference back of this matter  as an amendment. I have to say that our input into what is going on is still very strong. We are still attempting  to persuade people that the figures they have been given or have invented are wrong  and if we operate on the real figures  there is no reason for mass closures of elderly persons homes  and we are still attempting to make the refurbishment programme  work as best we can  to achieve the most we can in the shortest period and for the least money.\",\n",
       " \"Chairman I move formally. Seconder. Sec \\nRight we have  an amendment to be moved by Mr . I thought you would  Chairman, take it later I see a lot of hands up on the other side. erm  The reason why  we moved the amendment on this is  er Jim  been   and that has, we started to query the figures  I didn't get involved in the  all this week and th people like Jim , David  loads of my attention and the whole er exercise was a fraud  they're all bum figures  and when I checked, the figures I have checked here are done by a senior officer  when I showed 'im what stuff was being  wrong. apartments  and  I couldn't believe how they they there there could work up such a system  and I'm serious, I I really mean this Mr Chairman, it is serious. Now what you were doing was, you got the top figure  of available beds  and you this time, I'm only going for the this paper that is shown to me   a an an an and produced some place in in your apartments  and it says here, partly vacancies weekend in the first of August. I was surprised when I found out who the officer, a very capable officers what's done the figures. But then I was reminded  how I thought of a an accountant who was at work  what figure was five and five  and he said what figures did you have in mind. So what has happened here I believe, that  there was someone told, I don't know who it was was told  this is the figure, now you you you're . I will say that because as, we haven't heard the end by a long way for, of this one. Jim  pointed out that  and when I looked at, in the report here, page fifteen, two of your paper  and there it says in little letters B, little little two  appendix B a during the year, a three year period from June ninety three to October ninety six, the level of occupancy  the department's  afford. Vacancies who arise from five seventeen,had a figure of five seventeen, when I looked at this now, how could y , where did they get the figures from this . Didn't  that someone to do the the the homework for them. So you did, right at the top one as I said two thousand  four three four  and then the closure of Coulson House in it. Well I hope there's nobody in Coulson House because it's boarded up  and I cannot see how you get a vacant bed in Coulson House and this is  this exercise. So we take that away  and then you got the refurbishment programme  and now taken away from the refurbishment programme something like two hundred, now where is the  if you're refurbishing four homes  where is the vacancies when you close the home, you have made the staff the redundant, they go up the road or out wherever they're going to  redundancy  persons. You have made 'em red, you have made 'em redundant  and you in, in  you have  and I hope you've had nobody redundant because I've I'd be pleased to go out to those homes and say them come back and I would be pleased to go up to and say you've got your figures  wrong because you're saying that nobody's made redundant  ooh well I I'm so pleased. I hope I've been given  I hope I be   the temporary staff but,those homes are being refurbished, there are no vacant beds in those homes because they are being refurbished. You are carrying that number forward. Now if you have a rolling programme  and you wanna say we refurbish four at a time, roughly  I would say fifty beds in these two hundred, give or take  some money because they vary. That's taken out, must be taken out of the calculation because they're not vacant, you can't get anybody in there, the criteria I say, should be beds available for permanent occupation. Now  you count on that  but the next vote  then comes in and they're still not available  beds are not available in it, and the next four and the next four so you'll have, for years you'll have those out of operation  would you like to call it that way  and out of production. Now to weight that  and the next one  is  respite an short stay beds as you mentioned. Now if you any system you got to have beds  for short stay etcetera, you don't count them into whether the those are vacant, because you have to keep some of those vacant in emergencies etcetera  so you can't count them. Well, this is how you got the figures  and then you have the temporary absence as Jim  pointed out  and advance bookings. I got a higher figure than Jim because I was  I can't believe, believe this either th th the officer that, that, that, done this say to the, the, that's the figures that have produced  then they're completely wrong  and I can tell \\nTime  time  time \\nTime, right, I am moving the amendment the reference back and I'm handing those papers to the Chief Executive and I'm gonna ask the Chief Executive to get someone independent to do this  because you can't get away from the numbers that the numbers  I've  get someone independent I'll ask for that. You can't get away with a with a fraud like this. You can't away with er some bum figures like this one, it's not good enough for the members  to give, be given wrong information  and I  and I can tell you this  we'll be coming back again and then we would know and  where they were getting  where they were getting the seventeen homes \\nTime  \\nClosed right down no  is a load of bloody bunkum  the whole  I move \\nHave we a seconder? Have Mr \\nThank you Mr Chairman. For Mr  information  the vacancies are the difference between the number of beds we maintain and the number of residence we have. Every bed in that difference has to be paid for with wasted money  but in addition the loss of income from that bed has to be found from cuts elsewhere in social services. I frankly can't deal in the time allowed with what Mr  said, I have never heard so many inaccuracies and misconceptions in a speech, it was the most comprehensive political suicide speech I've heard yet in this council. The truth is Mr Chairman that community care had as it's major objective  extending choice, give the chance to stay at home to many people for as long as possible, to eliminated the unwanted percentage of residential placements. What it's revealed, totally unexpectedly  is the vast extent to which inappropriate placements have taken place for many years. Totally unexpected because frankly no government, no civil service would have given us as much money for residential places as they did if they'd known. The knumdrum where the people have gone has now been answered because  the amount of domiciliary care needed to keep them out of residential places to meet their needs and wishes turns out to be  very much less than we expected, on average less than seven hours a week. This report Mr Chairman is already history which is as Mr  has said not to say it doesn't represent  progress, it addresses for the first time the historical issues, it starts to address the lessons of the first quarter. We now know the outcome of the second quarter  ignoring today and tomorrow which can bring, can make no  major change in the scale of what we face. Leaving the rest of community care aside, the admissions to our part three E P H s were thirteen in July, twelve in August and in the first twenty eight days of September, just four. That's less than one placement for every ten homes over the quarter, an average of less than ten in total per month. We must now fear with good reason that it was the first three months which were not typical. Late last year I was accused of scaremongering, dismissive speakers rubbished the remarks of the district auditor, not interested in what he was saying. The only thing I could be safely accused of was understating the problem. I still commend this report to council as the first real stride along the road we have to take, there's no choice about that. This stride and those that have followed  last week, as recently as last week as Mr  said are already miles back along that road. The s the revolution of social services called for a rolling programme and a rolling review and the amendment Mr  is utterly meaningless because  the matter will be constantly referred back and further considered by social services whatever the amendment says that's what the original resolution said. It  contains a rolling review precisely so that it should remain a valid basis for whatever tomorrow may bring. In truth  the rolling review has become a running review  circumstances are changing with no respect for the committee cycle. Indeed some of us think we now know what bankers in the  republic felt like, if you stand up to make a speech the matter has moved on before you sit down again but I must tell you of the next major problem. Flowing from that  that which social service must face urgently  and that is this. From the low admission rate, the nine hundred thousand in our revenue budget which was shown this year as savings, seven hundred thousand of which was met by fudging community care money in June  is now  short by three hundred thousand so at the end of this year there will be an overspend or rather a loss of income of three hundred thousand  which will show up as a deficit on social services budget for this year. Next year the full year effect of the revenue budget  one point five five million, already two hundred thousand short, the estimated loss of income from reduced placements will now put another eight hundred thousand on that  er, so there will be a million next year, so I have to tell you there is a gap of one point three million pounds in the social services budget which we have not yet faced. Mr Chairman the social services committee and it's sub- committees face many more agonizing d decisions. Nobody wants to close any bed that is offering a good quality service, that is wanted and being used. No one can afford to keep open beds that are not being used, not just losing savings  but soaking up resources that can only come from cuts in other vital social services. The social service of this council. You're on time. Are controlled and driven  by events  not by any one party or any parties. For the sake of our service and their users we must ensure we are not overrun by those events. Thank you Mr  \\nThe support of the whole council now would recognise \\nThank you Mr  \\nand gratefully aid that work. Mr  please. Chairman, I must confess to being erm, to being somewhat pessimistic about this whole er  this this whole problem of of the need to refurbish and the need to tackle numbers in our elderly persons homes. I I listened to Mr  speech with some incredulity I must say, but I did listen to what he said and if what he said is true then I  I find some of the things  disturbing and and er I'd like to see his figures and I  I w I I  that there have certainly been er two messages coming to the social services committee in in in that case. I'm pessimistic because I believe that if the council is to tackle what I still believe to be a big problem  of the local authority then it cannot really do so without  the support  of the largest party on this authority and if  we have heard  erm an honest assessment of their perception of of the case, I I really I really do despair that this council  will will get to the bottom of the problem. Er, we were told by Mr  that there is no problem with numbers, remember there are two, there are two things we've got to tackle, one is numbers, two is conditions in our home. I mean, one's, one's entitled to ask I think if there is no problem, if we only have vacancies of two or three in our elderly persons homes  throughout the county  wh erm  why on earth did the director of the social serv , did the director of social services and his deputy at the meeting on the twenty fifth of August of the social services committee, say that this was the greatest problem which was facing this council. Why on earth eighteen months ago did the district auditor issue a letter saying that unless the council did something about the situation of numbers and of finance within its elderly persons homes then it would come in and it would require the council to  take action. Why on earth on the twenty fifth of August at the social services committee meeting did Labour put an amendment which  accepted that there was a vacancy problem  I quote from the Labourer, from from Labour amendment  that er we don't agree to closures, fair enough, that's your position. But that that we ask for an exploration of the feasibility of widening the use of homes  into nursing care, very sheltered accommodation, apartment style accommodation etcetera. Now if there is no problem  why on earth do we have to put that sort of  that sort of work by officers erm, in, in to action erm, so between the, if I understand Labour's position now Chairman, between the twenty fifth of August and the twenty eighth of September, we have now gone from  accepting the problem and seeing how we can solve a number problem to saying that there is no no number problem and that everyone is cooking the books. I find that quite incredible, if it's true erm  if it's true then it's a very serious allegation which Labour is making against the officers in social services department  and I imagine that if er, that if those numbers are proven then er I I shall be looking  I shall be looking for scalps because I have been, I would have been, so would the Liberal party and so would the Labour party, have been wrongly informed. I don't believe we have been wrongly informed but that's the logic of the charge which has been made. I I simply, I simply want er er a direct message from from the programme which is going on Chairman  incidentally I I note that Nottinghamshire County Council erm has found a a and the Labour group there has found it necessary to tackle  just the same problems  erm in elderly persons homes and that I understand that they have a a closure list of seven, now presumably that has been drawn up from a long list of a lot more than seven, say fourteen or fifteen from which they've made their final choice. I think we're entitled to ask if Nottinghamshire faces those problems, what is peculiar about Leicestershire that it did face those problems but all of a sudden it doesn't face those problems. I I don't think myself and I still have an open mind and I don't think that the Labour case  erm  adds up to be perfectly honest. I simply wanna say two things and that is this that within a month if this scheme is to work I believe that the council or the social services committee must draw up a long list of homes which it proposes to close and that long list will be in teams and that must be done not behind closed doors so that people know what is being proposed, we level with people who live in those institutions and they are fully acquainted with our, with our intentions  and secondly I think it's necessary to understand from this programme  that it is not just refurbishment programme, it is a refurbishment and closure programme  the simple equation being that the money that comes from closures from capital receipts and some revenue savings, actually goes into the rest to refurbish them. That is the scheme er as as I see it and unless, unless I I thi , unless that is progressed quickly then as I say I am extremely pessimistic and let me just  say Chairman the dangers of not going along that line  the dangers of the present scheme which was at the last planning committee meeting or or or was it  one of the social services committee anyway, where four were chosen or or it was said choose a small number. That I think is half a programme and while that might  erm  while that might appeal to er members of the Liberal party, half a cake's better than none. What I think the danger is there, from a Conservative political perspective, is that having, having, Liberals having with us if you like, got the principle through, Liberals may then go with the Labour party and say right we've got the principle through, we've identified four homes, let's have a refurbishment programme, a bit of airport money here, a bit of slippage there and we'll get this through and then we'll tackle the problem of closures and if closures is proving difficult let's ignore it for a year, let's do these four and let's go on. I would not recommend to this side that they have any truck with that particular perspective. Here, here. Erm, that is why I I b , that is why I'm against the amendment, I believe that decisions have been made. I still n , I still think that we need to make er quick pro progress Chairman but er unless we do make quick progress and unless we do understand what's going on and call a spade a spade then I think this programme is doomed. Thank you. Mrs \\nThank you Chair. Mr  asked why we should close our homes and let private homes profit  erm, if people choose either to go into the private sector or to stay into their own homes, what are we supposed to do  tell them they've got no choice but to keep our substandard homes going? That's quite ridiculous. He says seventy to seventy five percent are being directed towards the private sector  so why. I thought our social services people did that  if they run that why should they direct people away from their own livelihoods. That's quite ludicrous, why should they shoot themselves in the foot  and is Mr  seriously suggesting the same thing? I mean apart from a monstrous attack on our own officers who can't answer for themselves in this place. Why should they be prejudicing the the jobs of the their colleagues, I, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Now I think the tables speak for themselves  and they're born out by paragraph sixteen B of the report on page fifty nine. I just wonder when Mr  asks for other figures from the independent sector  what would have happened if the figures that you've got before you today had actually come from the private sector. I suspect he would have been making exactly the same speech but saying that the figures were suspect because they had been come from somewhere else. Thank you. Mrs \\nThank you Chairman. I re do regret that this has come to full council yet again because I thought we'd already had the debate. At the social services planning committee  we stated that we were anxious to make a fresh start in addressing the problems of our elderly persons homes. In the end Chairman,we did reach consensus  and I find no difficulty with that. But our original vision  had almost been lost  in the unclean political battles which have taken place. I re-read the speech that I gave in this full council chamber  on November the twentieth nineteen ninety one  nothing has changed except possibly it has got worse. What has changed though is the refurbishment programme and I'm not quite sure what Mr  was on about about er er the refurbishment programme. The officers advised us  that we could deal with four homes a year. So that's why we said well let's get on and decide which of the next four homes to be refurbished. So as that we could have the rolling programme. No one should ever underestimate the trauma of change on res on residents  their relatives  and the staff involved, either in the refurbishment programme or  in future closers and we have never denied that there will not be closures, we have consistently proposed that there should be. It's unfortunate that yet again  the Mercury got it wrong  they stated that we had made a decision to close four homes \\nunnamed  that is not true and I do agree with Mr   that when we make a decision to close  some homes that they should be named to avoid the terrible indecision which exists at the moment. I'm sorry Mr  has referred to closures in their teens cos this again throws residents and staff into total confusion  we're too early  in the  programme of community care to know how many homes are going to close. We do know that two or three or four may have to in the foreseeable future. But without rationalisation Chairman  we will not be able to extend those services that we all know that we want to assist people to stay in their own homes. We've argued for years  about meals on wheel service  that there should be seven day a week service throughout this authority, we've only got it in the City, we want it throughout the authority. We will not be able to supply an adequate home care service without the release of the resources that are tied up in our elderly persons homes. We shall not be able to produce ethnically appropriate services without the necessary finance  and nor will we be able to develop new services which are innovative to assist people to stay in their own homes and I'm just going to take one moment to mention one or two Chairman. Why can't you have a flying warden service if you stay in your own home like in warden assisted accommodation. I'd love to see a service where somebody could come and knock on your door in the morning  and say are you alright and call again in the evening, just as if you were in warden assisted accommodation. If we have a night sitting service, an elderly person may not have to go in hospital if they are temporarily gone off their legs as sometimes happens. After tiny U-turns Chairman  two by the Tories and one by the Labour group, I do  hope that finally we're going to make progress tonight. Thank you. Professor . I was only going to say Chairman I wish people wouldn't  band the figures around the council chamber which nobody  has seen before therefore can't assess. The issue here is quite simple, Labour  have consistently  turned their back on any closures, that's fair enough, so you wouldn't expect them then to produce figures  which demonstrate that they're right. The Conservatives have now  the Conservatives have now decided  that home closure is the thing and you'd expect them to produce figures to say we've got to have thirteen or whatever number closed. What the, I believe committees have never had and least of all Mr   papers produced on behalf of Mr  have never had a serious  rigorous  objective assessment of  the vacancy situation of the future which first of all starts from  issue  a rolling programme of refurbishments  that we haven't really seen sight of the of the implications of that on the number of vacancies. This has never had it  so this  as far as I'm concerned really, the only thing that is needs to be made clear, is that we must accept  of principle   that's all we need to  reason. Mr . Chairman I think this is probably the first time in this council chamber in twenty years  that er I will probably have spoken on er social services issues  er and I speak from an entirely private capacity and any information that er  that comes my way is from what I might call  informed members of the public  erm, people who I come into contact with and from my own experiences as a ward councillor and from  as we all do from time to time, my own family experience, my own domestic experiences  and I do know  something about the problems which are associated with the  the care of elderly people  er although I don't have that problem now  erm  things have taken their course. Er, Professor  is right  erm  there may always be a possibility that at some time er you have to  you have to recognise that there may be excess capacity in the system  and I I don't believe that the Labour party is not prepared to recognise that there may well be  excess capacity in the system at some time. S what in fact er Mrs  said  is too early in the process of  community care  to know how many homes you have to close  she really is approaching it from the wrong way, it's equally too early in the process of community care to know how many homes  you need to have open, keep open or open  and that is one of the problems which I believe this council and other councils will will face. Now from my  observations of these debates  I've not heard anybody on this council saying council debates that there is no role  for  this local authority or any other local authority  there is no role for them in the provision of residential care  or any extension of residential care because some of our residential care  is getting very, very close to providing a degree of nursing care. Nobody stands up and says that we shouldn't be in the business at all, we should get rid of all of them, so all the argument about how many. Every group in this council and I believe every member who speaks, agrees that we have a need to refurbish homes. So those are the positive things about which we we all agree. Now I would  urge this council that it really is too early in the process for you to start making up your minds about what you're gonna in future. You simply do not have enough data. There is  a perception amongst informed people in the community  that  there may well be a shortage of long stay beds in Leicestershire  and you do need to bear in mind  that the National Health Service  is increasingly going down the road  of not keeping people in hospitals longer than they have to because hospitals are perceived as being  very, a very expensive way  of providing beds  and you have to take that into account because that's a fairly clear national policy  and you are likely to see an acceleration in that process from what I read  in the national press. There's also a general view in the community that community care itself is not necessarily really working very well, there's some fears about it, some uncertainties  and a member did mention, it may have been Jim  you know or somebody mentioned about the seven hours domiciliary, from my experience as a councillor  I am not sure that simply because that figure exists that that means that that is satisfying the need of those people  and in any case  the sort of people who need to go into residential care, who can no longer be maintained in their home, with whatever help we give them or with whatever help their family have to give them  they're not necessarily the sort of people who we're talking about need to go in a home. You must always remember that it's been a fairly small percentage of the frail elderly people who've actually ever had to go into homes. Most of the people in some way or other, have been looked after by somebody else and that's the experience which I  I've certainly gone through  and if in fact you start making up your mind too early  about which homes you're going to \\nNear time \\nclose, I can assure you Chairman  recognise the time, I can assure you Chairman  that our social workers when doing assessments will not, because I've had this from them, at grass roots level in a branch local party meeting,that our social workers will not indicate to those people who they've assessed that there are vacancies in those homes. They steer people away from any home which they believe is likely to be closed  and once you start doing this, you will in fact be sealing the fate of those homes and you it's a very, very dangerous game, you've gotta be, you've gotta play it very, very carefully indeed and I  hope Chairman that there can be a degree of  common sense and rationality introduced into discussions between the  members of the various groups who have to deal with these very difficult issues. Thank you. Mr \\nThank you Mr Chairman. Well I believe that the report that er  is before us that has been moved  erm  actually sets out a framework which the social service committee is able to  work to  and to monitor and I see no point whatsoever in referring this  back to social services  erm  to delay further what is the inevitable. The figures that have been mentioned er  and the danger with figures that are mentioned  is that they can't be everything  to everybody. Now eighteen months ago  we had three hundred and, it was April, the report in April nineteen ninety two  there were three hundred and sixty  five I think it was  places that were  vacant in our homes and this is before we started the refurbishment. Now if  Jim  is telling us that there are four hundred and ten vacancies now  and he's explained where those four hundred and  ten vacancies are  we've picked up another fifty p places within that eighteen months. So we do have a problem to address  but the  I I like Mr  would certainly want some explanation from the director of social services if  erm the report that we have before us at the  planning sub-committee is incorrect because I  deal with it said it it be noted that the capacity now exists to arrange for the transfer of residents from four homes to other res residential units as part of the rationalisation programme. Not part of the refurbishment programme, not the difference. So we do have a problem  and and we need to grasp that  the a conclusion  talking about rolling programme  we are concerned about resources we're, we're, we're concerned about using them to the best  advantage. We set up  to be able to look at the refurbishment of our homes. Now if we are going to say that this rolling programme, we we don't mean this rolling programme because it it's all going back to committees again to be  to be looked at  then we are putting our  at a disadvantage  they will disband and the cost to us for refurbishment  will  increase. It's essential that in the terms of the  er report from the social service committee that we work, we work to the framework within that report. We have the ability to monitor it and I think that the discussions will have to take place as the director brings forward his proposals. There is a great deal within that framework  er, it's not just about closing  elderly persons homes, it's not just about refurbishment  it's about resources and it's resources that we're very short of, to implement the sort of care programme that this council should be addressing.\",\n",

Now  I \\nI wondered whether you'd ever get it or not, come on quick quick. Now what we'll be Mr Chairman is this. This has been hanging about for a long, long time  while I've been on this   and these people  and they're very special people  I've got this sword of  hanging over my head. Now  these, why do I call these special people, for the first thing  we're just coming out of a recession  they s \\nWith three million unemployed \\nThese people suffered the depression  and if you saw deprivation  that was deprivation.

They got the jackets off, they did the job, they laid it out for us. Now surely we owe these people something better than this  surely  there's  got the wickedness out or the intelligence to get  this thing off the ground.

       " \"Here, here. Thank you. Mr  do you want to speak or reserve your remark. Yeah, I think some of the new members should wait to speak Chair. Chair, sorry  right, I I've I I've don't very often. It's gone, it's gone   I don't very often agree with  Professor   erm  I very often don't agree with David  either but I've got to admit that I agree with both of them today, we've got to make haste slowly on this one. It's alright  us starting to  go along the road of closures, but some of us have been here  through it a lot, little bit longer than others and I think  we have got to watch what we're doing. We don't know  what the capacity is gonna be needed in the future. If the government gets its way and starts slapping  seventeen and a half percent, twenty percent V A T on fuel, we might need some more residential places  you don't know. If the figures that we've been given  the recent figures, cos w I've been working on figures for August   up to August but now we've got even better figures. If these figures are right  that we've been given by the department and I'm not saying them whether they're right or whether they're wrong  but  well we have to r rely on what we're getting this is why Mr   is sending this lot to the Chief Executive for him to do some work  I think it's very important that it is done independently, not by the independent sector but by done independently. If those figures are right of four hundred and ten now  you don't need to  be a real big mathematician, even at this time of night,but you, if you have the two hundred and thirty four  out of commission and you've got to have those cos that's gotta be a rolling programme each four years. You're gonna have that two hundred odd  there rolling over, it's gotta happen until the end of the programme and that is likely to take six, seven, eight  years. You're way about half a century. That might be the simplest way  and if you add that to the seventy two that are out of commission short term beds, holiday beds, which you've got to keep empty anyway. You've got your three hundred and six. Now  we've been told by, in reports  that we've got  five, six hundred up to ni , we're gonna have nine hundred vacancies  this is Mr \\nat committee I said that \\nunclear \\nCan we, can we come through the Chair \\nI think it's, it's very interesting that erm  the these figures are there. Now if we're gonna have those sort of figures we're talking about. What are we basing them on? I want to see, I'm I mean I saw Mr  and erm Mr  nodding when Martin  said he wanted to give these figures to the Chief Exec  and ask him to er  get it sorted out. I think that's right so, we we mustn't even start even thinking about closing beds at the moment. If we've only got two or three in each home empty, where are the people going to? I've checked with Demontfort House  today. Ear early before I came over here and they've got no vacancies  none  none at  Demontfort House at all. We're told, we're told though in the report for Au for August  that we've got so many vacancies here, if we look at Nuffield House in the August report there was fourteen, but we're only just refilling it again  after closing it. We're only just refilling it. Now  I don't know where  Mr  has got some of his figures from but I think we ought to  check  both our figures and his figures before we start jumping to \\nNot my figures please . Erm Mr Chairman on a point of information, the figures he has obtained on my figures are figures in a report  issued by the director of social services and I think on a point of  information he should acknowledge that they are the figures given by the officers. Thank you. They were not supplied \\nAnd orders from you, yep. Now we must keep  we must keep be I know people and I'm sure every member in this council chamber knows people that need respite care. If you don't you're not wal you're walking around with your eyes closed. I certainly do in my patch. There are people that we are redirecting, we were re redirecting  from Demontfort House at one time, it was denied  denied by by officers that it was happening. Denied by Mrs  she had a letter. But you ask the people that work there, you ask social  workers . That place was gradually being run down  like a lot of the other are. David, near time. As far as the Nottinghamshire erm  thing  the reason Notts are having to close it is because the they've been capped haven't they and they've gotta save money. Now I think this is what's behind all this actually. Not to do with looking after people at all. It's to start saving money and give some and give some of this money to their private sector friends. Once again this is what's happened. Thank you David, thank you. So Chair, I will second these resolut , the the amendment. Mr \\nYes, thank you Chair, erm  A lot of this debate circles around  what we do about community care, I have to tell this council  as far as I'm concerned, community care's dead in the water. Without massive input from central government and local government there is no community care  there are people out there  not receiving the services they deserve  \\nWith no prospect of receiving the services they deserve. Let's not pretend that we can escape from our responsibility to these old people  by pretending that the community will take care of them, that's not the way it's gonna be. er  Mr  talked about the figures, I'm convinced that the figures that, that I was given still include Perzon House  I'm convinced that those figures were not, have not been taken out  erm  I don't know who should audit the figures, perhaps the internal audit should audit the figures. Yes, Yes, here, here. Mr  was completely wrong about the Labour amendment  erm  in fact he read out the wrong amendment altogether. The Labour amendment was to explore ways in which resources can be provided to fund and enhance refurbishment programme without closures and that for the next two years the additional necessary funding be sourced from   housing benefit income and income from the sale of East Midlands Airport and from other capital receipts. Now  if the Labour group had moved a widening of erm  the sort of provision in our elderly persons homes, I could have understood that, because we didn't have real figures, we could not get hold of real figures, every time I went back to a local party meeting, to the Labour group, to any other member they said, do you realise this home has this number of vacancies and your report says that number. Do you realise that the figures are out that everybody knows that the figures are out. Is Mr  and is er capacity for understatement. His desire to devastate our residential sector and close seventeen homes will be thwarted  somebody  over there, it may have been Mr  it may not have been, said that there hadn't been any redundancies. Arbour House  twenty four staff, twelve redundancies, twelve redeployed. Huntingdon Court twenty nine staff, ten redundancies, seventeen redeployed, two still in temporary posts. The Limes,provisional figures twenty nine ninety three, closing during October, thirty four staff, sixteen redundancies, fifteen redeployed, two ill health retirements, one retirement. Bythorpe Hall twenty one redundancies, six lay off agreements, two redeployed, one temporary for a year, one on trial period two to three months. Kurzon House  twenty eight staff, seventeen redundancies of which two  re since redeployed  ten redeployed, one ill health retirement, of course there are no redundancies. We've not made anyone redundant, no one at all. That Labour amendment I read out  mentioned the airport money. I'm aware  as everybody else is, that we could  do the sort of sweepstake that we carry out on th , what time the meeting's gonna close and everybody can just put down how \\nmany times the the airport money had been spent. But the real fact is if this council regards elderly persons homes as the priority it pretends  then it has to be the first priority for that money. It doesn't have to stand in line  behind anything else. About  er refurbishment and closure programme Mr  talked about, a a refurbishment and closure programme is a Tory programme, not a Labour programme  and of course this is all verified by Mrs  coming along to the committee  and saying please don't close Barleythorpe Hall, please tell the people that you're going to re-open Barleythorpe Hall, please do not allow them to think that it's going to close. Has anyone seen Barleythorpe Hall? Does anyone know what needs to be done there, what the work is and how much it is gonna cost, I'm sure Mrs  seen it. So why are social workers directed people into the private sector, they are under the same constant pressure of letters from the private sector, the wingeing, the groaning, the moaning, the threats of  legal action, the threats of judicial review as the rest of us. Hardly surprising that they over compensate is it  put people into the private sector. I didn't understand her questions  was it the figures had come from the private sector I'm not sure if she understood it herself either  erm  we've talked  in the  social services planning cuts committee about a list of homes for refurbishment  and Mr  wanted a very long list  er  a list which would blight every home not on the list. Mrs  talked about four, we've actually agreed that there should be more homes on the list than four  er for prospective refurbishment  and  Mr  has stood up and protested that he did not produce the figures, but Professor   still says you will produce figures for this and you will produce figures for that, none of us do that  we all get our figures from the same place  but we all get inconsistent figures. erm, Mr  knows when he talked about getting rid of all the a ho , our homes that of course, we're not allowed to get rid of all of our homes, if we were the Tories would have moved it years ago. But  what does happen is that people are directed away from blighted homes  we know that that happens, it happens all the time, as soon as a home's name is mentioned  social workers, quite  honourably believe that there's no sense in putting down people's names, no no sense in sending people there and you would expect nothing different from them so  it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. The point to Mr , the point of the reference back  is simply to allow us to say that we do not accept the figures that we're being presented with. We will not accept those figures because they are not correct. Everybody agrees now that the figures before us are not correct as everybody produces a different set  er, it's alright for Mr  to sit there and Mr  like Heckyl and Jeckyl saying no we don't, no we don't, but he comes forward with different figures, worst figures \\nthan we're presented with in the reports, he does it all the time Chairman. As for Mr  we're out of recession are we?well  if that's an excuse for saying  let's close homes  well, I think that's a a terrible shame, all he, the certainty that he wants to offer to our elderly people is the certainty that their home will close and they'll be thrown out of it. People really do have to understand the trauma we are talking about with moving people out of homes, the trauma that  moving them out for refurbishment is bad enough. But telling them that they will not move back is even worse. We really do  have to put a human face onto these figures and these financial arguments, until we do that, we will not carry any decision  in this council chamber which is worth a light to any single elderly person in any of our homes or outside of our homes Chairman. I recommend to you the amendment. Right, we now put the amendment. Those in favour please show. Right, we're just going to count. right, those against  the amendment is lost, thirty six forty, er those in favour of the substantive motion please say aye. Aye. Those against. No. The ayes have it. We will now have a fifteen minute recess. Six D the report of public protection committee. Yes, I've just counted them, Robert counts as two, Bob\\nthat's important  you see   right . That's promotion in the Labour rank  would you like to move the motion please Mr . Would you prepare to move the motion please. Yes, sorry Mr Chairman  erm  I move, what'm I doing? I move in the er public protection report that er Mr Chairman, the bell's still going   do you want me to hang on a minute or what? No carry on, I, the first bell there they should have been in. Carry on. But people are gonna miss my blooming speech  they'll miss it. I know you spent hours, I know you spent hours preparing this speech. I haven't actually. The important ones are here, proceed please. I've prepared  the amendment in the  in in removing the port er Mr Chairman I think it's erm  important to note the reason why the public protection committee have asked the report to be put onto the council agenda. Not simply because  we also want to put our  bid in straightaway for the airport money  which is er  contrary to opinion \\nhad been noted. but to highlight to members of the council the importance of  having  the proper funding er er for the southern fire station. The reasons for the southern fire station are clearly outlined on page seventy and seventy one  which is an extract from her Majesty's fire   service inspectorate. In particular item eleven point three  of that where the H M I said sufficient capital  should be provided to enable the provision of the southern fire station to go ahead. There is  a large area of new build  around where the southern fire station  will be and I do say will be  because it will be. That sounded, that sounded er, sounded quite good  \\nA promise  and er one of the  im important things er is that the Chief Fire Officer is currently away in  Glasgow at the Fire Service conference, as you're well aware. But I spoke with Mr  about half an hour ago on the telephone, told him not to worry at all, that \\nthat's confidence. This evening Bob  will be changing his amendment to read the funds will be provided rather than consideration. And the Chief said that doesn't compare  he said that does not concur with a visit I had last night in Glasgow whilst asleep when he awoke to a gleaming light at his bedroom and  he said who are you and this  figure said I am God  and the Chief Fire Officer said well God, all I want to know is one thing, will I get my southern fire station? And God said not in my lifetime. Cos I've since spoke to God Mr Chairman. and he is, as you do, as you do, and he assures me that er we will get the fire station. I don't wish to underestimate it  the, our attendance times  around the Meridian Park area, the large new build area Mr Chairman  erm, our attendance times there are shocking to say the least. No fault of our brigade at all, there's a desperate need for the southern fire station to go ahead without any doubt whatsoever, lives are at risk  and the longer we leave this  the more the costs will keep increasing  and er  I  I believe  that  the airport money  should be used  to build \\nAnother one now, it's all gone now  \\nOwen, it's not spent yet. Trust me. Trust me I said not truss me, trust me. We have one of the best fire services and the best brigades in this country Mr Chairman  and you none the least Mr Chairman on some of you recent visits and meeting some of our fire personnel are more than aware we are  the the best equipped, the cheapest  brigade  and  our chaps and girls in Leicestershire, the morale is very high, regardless of what's going on around the pay dispute at the moment  and I think that we need to show our support  to those fire personnel and provide the adequate funding for the southern fire station. I'm assured by Tommy  that after I open the  Saw Valley Way er traffic jam on November the third, you you'll get a slight better erm, slightly better chance traffic through, er.\",\n",
       " \"Have we a seconder? Have you reserved any remarks, you want  er Mrs   do you wish to speak? I sorry, sorry. We'll have the amendment first shall we? Yes, let's have the amendment. We have an amendment by Mr . I only did that just to test to see if you were awake. I think er in an effort to accommodate Mr Chairman, the members here this evening, it's been quite a long day, the the Conservative amendment is very close to  the amendment that both er myself and Mr  have put in  and yes we would be willing to  accept that, I think we've got the point across which the only thing missing from the Conservative amendment is the thing about the airport money. I think I've made that point\\nWill you accept this subject in the raffle? Chairman all I've heard so far is music to my ears er thank you. I'd like to er say one or two words before er moving the amendment and I, I'm very pleased to to hear that the two are to be incorporated as it were into this one. Members of the public protection committee take due note of the contents of Her Majesty's Inspector's current report, but in particular we take note of his concerns that the standard of fire cover  in an area to the South West of the city is inadequate. He's repeated his concern to us regularly for eight years  eight years. I've no difficulty in seeing why he's concerned er because I've seen the figures and examine the situation in in great detail. But even without the figures it takes very little imagination to see why this council must not put off any longer the construction and commissioning of the southern fire station. Imagine with me Chairman if you will  the thoughts of someone trapped by some misfortune in the midst of the wreckage of a road traffic accident  on the M 1 motorway Southbound between junctions twenty one and twenty  that's at Nutterworth or Northbound between twenty one and twenty two  or Westbound on the M 69  they'll be thinking  the fire brigade'll be here in a minute or two. Certainly the first appliance will arrive  but on the opposite carriageway because it's coming from Nutterworth or Hinkley or Colvill  severely hampering what that appliance crew can do speedily. It's unlikely that they will imagine that the most helpful appliance  is most likely to be one of three, battling to get through the traffic from new parts of Leicester, Lancaster Place Leicester and Wigstone. Three because the Chief Fire Officer cannot guarantee any longer er that  if he only despatched the one which is necessary, it would actually get through the traffic. Similarly in the vast residential and commercial areas of Enderby, Norborough, Homkirk, Cosby, Watchton Croft, parts of Broadstone and Meridian itself  the delays have become unacceptable. This area is the furthest such populated area from a fire station in the county. I have witnessed myself the effects of the delays on a number of occasions. Within the past year a small fire in a large Victorian house only fifty yards from my workplace  watching helplessly while the building became engulfed before the brigade arrived from Leicester and Wigstone, five and six miles distance  distant. Minutes matter, we all know this because of regular news reports, videos and demonstrations to the committee. I know because many years ago I happened to be in the right place, in the ambulance I was driving at the right time and was able to e effect a rescue of an old woman from her smoke filled house at Burstill Ten minutes later I could not have done it because of the smoke. The fire brigade arriving five minutes later might have done it, ten minutes, definitely not. The Chief Fire Officer advises us that the attendance times to the areas I have mentioned are regularly over the response times allowed by the standards of fire cover. He tells me that attendances between three and five minutes, over the ten minutes allowed are common. Five, six, seven, eight minutes are understandable and acceptable  lives are regularly saved in that time. More than the ten minutes allowed is no longer acceptable to the inspector  or to the many thousands of people who live and work in a large and congested area of Leicestershire. Southern fire station will not only direct cover  directly cover these areas but also provide essential back up cover to a much larger area including Glaby, Wigstone, Nutterworth, Hinkley and parts of the City. It is pleasing  that there is a large degree of support  for the Southern fire station as I said it was music to my ears. This has been expressed by the acquisition of land by this council at Meridian and by placing the scheme in the capital programme as a high priority. At our last meeting  the council noted during question time that Mr  and I agree that the saving of life from fire is an overriding priority for this council. I therefore urge members to agree  on by whatever mechanism the financial experts deem proper, I'll say no more than that, er to place Southern fire station firmly in the capital programme for next year  and ensure revenue monies are available to enable its swift and essential opening. With all sincerity  er Mr Chairman on behalf of the people who live and work in that area I move the amendment. Mrs \\nMr . Yes, thank you Chairman. I find this \\nJust a minute, can you hold just a moment er just a minute \\nCan I just make it clear Chairman on the amendment. As I understand the position Mr  and Mrs  and the council have accepted that amendment so you've now got that as your motion with your debate. I am pleased to hear that Sir. Chairman it makes the whole thing far simpler I think because there isn't really no disagreement about this whatsoever. I've read about Mr  help line, I didn't realise he had a direct connection to the almighty but  he's obviously got his instructions and erm we are very pleased that he's going along the right lines. Now this really is one of the most important things on the agenda today. It is far more important in my view than a token ban on fox hunting on which we spent hours earlier on in the afternoon. This is the kind of thing that we really ought to be addressing because this actually addresses the safety of people in this county, not only the safety of people, this addresses the safety of property as well and there's no disagreement about the fact that this enormous development that's happened over the last few years in an area where you've got a regular traffic snarl-ups mean that you have got a potential disaster there on your hands and we're jolly lucky we haven't any  more serious incidents than we've had already and so I can see no reason why these two mo these two amendments shouldn't both happily be accepted  though I'm very cynical about the number of times we've spent the airport money already and sooner or later we've obviously got to actually seriously address that but the important thing is that we do all take it seriously and it seems that we all do now take it seriously. That what the inspector's been telling us year after year, that we are in serious danger of not  coming up to the  protection safety standards, is something that we can't push into the background any longer and I'm very glad it's come to the full council so that the whole council can take it seriously  the public protection committee has taken it seriously for a very long time. Mr . Mr Chairman, I I welcome this opportunity  er of of saying just a very brief word about fire service because as a new member I think one of the services that this county  has  er er is top in is the fire service. It has impressed  but it has to have the right tools  if it is going to provide  the safety that councillor  referred to and the saving of life which was referred to by councillor . I welcome too that  the Labour party have accepted the amendment. We now have a a piece of land  which we can't use for fox hunting, so let's use it for the purpose it was bought for, use it for the fire station. But why I am pleased  that this has been, that the amendment has been accepted is  because of the words  and that projection's been made of the eventual revenue requirements to enable proper future provision to be budgeted for. It is very important this is done, we can join the raffle for the East Midlands airport and I'll tell you this I will help you pick out the winning ticket  er but  we cannot use the East Midlands airport money for revenue to run the stations. To often we have heard of buildings that have been put under capital expenditure and then the revenue has not been available for their use. I think we must make it a positive step forward that this council not only goes forwards to build but it goes forward to use that building and give the firemen of this county  the right tools, or firewoman, the firemen and the firewoman of this county the right tools to work with. Thank you. Mr \\nI suppose I'm the er ghost at the feast. First of all I  that at no time  have the Labour, the Liberal and the Conservative not been totally in favour of this fire station. They were last year, they gave an undertaking to do it as soon as possible, it is a case of where the money comes from  er  Mr  of course is relatively new  er we don't bother about as a rule about what he casts as new costs in new staff. We just passed the revenue, the capital, the revenue then goes on the base budget, is called the revenue consequence of capital expenditure and all the fire officers ask for is enough to build a fire station  and the cost of running it is automatically going onto your bill. Now somewhere we've gotta sort this out, because this is part of last year. Figures may be updated I seem to remember the fire station somewhere in the region of a million plus  and the cost of running it was three hundred thousand a year. Now both of these costs were fine, if this is your priority it's alright. I hope you'll pick out what's got to come from the East Midlands National airport, can I remind you that  a list of that has already been made and passed by this council when there was not a Conservative majority  and that had on it about seventy traffic calming schemes  bottlenecks'll be done all over this county which in themselves save accidents and save lives. Now  er  there are some areas based in my area where you wouldn't get the fire station, the fire engine  through the bottleneck in ten minutes  erm, all this has got to be put in its relative priority. Now as long as this is council budget if this is what you prefer rather than Dovelands school  that's alright, this is the problem that the financial committee will be faced with this year. Urgent demand for which I totally agree  for millions more than the money is available  er, as long as all the council says this is our priority of course you can have it. As long as you're answerable  for the other priorities that can't be met. I'm totally in support of this, I'm support of a lot,want to be done. As long as we accept that there is a limit to what can be done and that in no way's detracted from fire station. I'm delighted   fire station's run  at a low cost. Members here sometimes were almost ashamed of the fact. There's also want more money to  cheapest in the country and I say good  and I hope we can fit it in  this budget time and I hope we all support this, for this. I hope when the financial sub-committee  suggests the capital expenditure  one isn't there. You will carry back to your electorate and tell them why it wasn't there. Do you want Dovelands put back?cos Dovelands didn't come on this year either and this is a a dilemma that will face us all. I'm delighted it it's a Conservative erm  er resol er erm amendment  that I think is agreed by all the council. That all agree this is a very high priority. Next February will you still live with that priority. Well we will, you might not. Thank you for putting some life in the proceedings Jim. Mr . In short all I hope that er this unanimous er feeling for the fire service stays in this next pending dispute. I hope you still support firemen through their troubled times in the next few months. Thank you Chair. Right Mr  you want to reply  like to reply. Thank you very much Mr Chairman. Very quickly  erm  er  the Mrs  said that er yes I do have a direct er line to God and one of the messages he did give me was that I should start to write Focus. Perhaps we could er  \\nI thought God was writing that \\nVery constructive  er Mr . Mr  erm er we've actually got the land for the er the fire station, I think you you were there with us. Well it can't be used for fox hunting now. That's true. erm, it's actually sitting there on the Meridian er Business Park, it's been sitting there for three years  er overgrown with er  grass and what have you and it's there. Mr  just very quickly  erm I disagree with your analogy about the ghost  but probably the rest of it, I'm not too sure  erm  the figures for the running of the fire station have been updated. It's no longer three hundred thousand pounds, the Chief Fire Officer and the Deputy Chief Fire Officer along with the er, the finance wizard David, have worked very very hard on er producing revised figures, scrimping and scraping  equipment from other stations  and the the actual figure is about a hundred and sixty four thousand pounds now. We brought the figure down  having at le , and waited two years and that's th , I think that proves the lad's foundation to the argument  of how desperate the fire service need, need this station and it has absolutely nothing to do with Dovelands school er er whatsoever  as far as I'm concerned, I'm the spokesperson for public protection not education and that's it  and er I'm surprised er er that I know erm er er that Mr  is is a very, very good supporter of the er southern fire station and supported us in the er  in the er question we asked at the last council er meeting and er  I'm surprised he hasn't spoke or even Mr   who er, who likes to s , who likes to speak in the chamber but I've  hasn't supported the fire station. Thank you very much. Would those in favour of the amendment  I'm very sorry but er it's not an automatic right, sorry, I'd like to have called him but  er we've summed up, what do we do now? We have re, technically reached the end of the debate I'm very sorry Mr   I'm sorry  you'll have to wave a little I'm very sorry  er, those in favour of the  ame amendment. It's an amended motion \\nThe amended motion please show. So that's subject to Robert getting confirmation on Sunday then. Er  I wish to move that the  er motion which is on the green order paper. I do draw  member's er  an an in particular Mr  attention to  paragraphs seven and eight of the report. Paragraph seven making it clear  put that an initial assessment has already  established  er  it has already passed the preliminary assessment stage  er and that er  the director is undertaking the data collection procedure so that the site can be properly assessed and I do drawn  er Mr  attention  er to that  I erm  have taken the opportunity during the last adjournment Chairman to to speak to Mr  about the appropriateness  of the wording of his er er amendment and I believe that he  he may  wish to  er move something which is slightly different  er which will certainly er  we'll deal with that er if he does move that but er  it clearly is the intention of this report and of the committee that when the  work has been completed on the assessment of traffic calming measure in Shalford and its priority established, that we would then bring er another report  er to the highways and transportation committee in response to this petition  er as as indeed is set out in paragraph ten B  and if Mr  wished that to be brought forward through to council then that will be done but I leave to him if he wish to move an amendment to make it quite clear, since er  I must say this motion is rather bland. Mr \\nSeconded Chair, reserve my remarks. Can I, I would like to  change the wording of the er amendment and I'm grateful to Mr  for the advice he gave because I think by erm a slightly shorter and er  er brisker wording I can achieve the objectives that I set out to achieve. If if if we  if I withdraw the amendment in in terms that's on the order paper and substitute  after the, after the  erm, wording where it goes  traffic calming measures on the B forty one at Charnford  and add on  and that a further report be presented on traffic calming measures in response to the petition. If that could be added  that would achieve my objectives  and we can all get on to the debate about V A T on. Is that acceptable?\",\n",

Thank you Mr Chairman. As you know it, this is the last  I'm sure everyone's aware it's the last item  on your agenda  when I was looking at the agenda  this item was before the fox hunting motion  I thought well  it'd be nice to have a debate before the fox hunting motion because we would have  er  a full house  of people who I'm sure would be very interested  to hear the discussion on V A T. As matter of fact I'm sure they would w w would welcome  the opportunity to have a de , a discussion, but it seems they have gone and I got, I got it wrong Chairman when you   by taking the the the fox hunting motion  it should really have, have held on till this time in the evening. Er  I and the council will  recall the last time we had a motion on V A T  when we asked. the last council. The last council yes  and why not  and this council and we haven't heard the end of it yet, well I'll be coming to that bit  don't rush, don't rush me    We did ask the Secretary of State  not to impose V A T on fuel and light  because of the hardship it would impose  on the people and in particular  elderly  pensioners, sick and  invalids. We wrote to the Secretary of State  after you passed that motion  so it appears from the correspondence we have back from the Secretary of State  that  they are bloody minded on this one  and they're going to, he's going to support, press on  with the imposition of V A T and  since that time we we see he's well supported by the cabinet. Now the the motion's expressing concern over the government's intention. when we got the letters back from the Secretary of State  one of his  excuses if you like, for imposing such a savage  tax  was that it was  save fuel  and help the environment. Now there's no mention  of the human unhappiness  by the imposition of the V A T  and what this w w would, the concern  no concern whatsoever about this savage tax. Now  when the Chancellor in the budget  said that he would  help the poor  he stopped short, there were no  copper bottomed  no copper bottom  guarantee  and then later on we had Michael Portillo  got in on the act. Now Michael Portillo is one of the Tory high flyers, for anyone that don't know who he is, he's a Tory high flyer  who finds it very difficult  to look down, very difficult to look down on those  but he should look down before he makes a such statements. Michael said there would be no special compensation  so you can imagine why we're concerned  and why we have this back on the  as a motion again. A motion to  monitor  the effects it will have on people that we are responsible for. So really  it's only right that this council  should follow up on such a motion. Because things are looking fairly bleak for pensions, disable etcetera. Looking at the report and using the  present criteria  for increase in pensions  and these are the figures that  I didn't produce  but er  they look pretty bleak as I said because  what the pensions can expect next year  will be eighty four P for single pensioners and one twenty eight in that area for a couple  and then we had look at  we have some concern of what happened yesterday in a statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer who said he is going to  extend V A T  and also it has now been  that instead of putting on half of it in nineteen ninety four  he put the full  pile at seventeen and a half percent in nineteen ninety four because what was being saved  is that if he's  leave the other half to nineteen ninety five it'll be round near the elections and er there could be some difficulty. I was hoping there would and I will still hope because there's not for the political reas , I would hope that  that the minister would not a U-turn, the Chancellor would do a U-turn on this one. Because  I can, I'm surprised that the Tory party's . It'll haunt the Tory party  for years. It'll be a bigger bone than  a bigger bone than ever the poll tax was. Now you say well why do a U-turn I see no reason why because  they done a few U-turns  on the child benefit  they done a U-turn, they picked it up and then blocked it. Charging pensioners and children for medical prescriptions  picked that one up and dropped it  like a hot potato  and charging for hospital treatment and why  so why not do a U-turn on on this one? We must think Jim  of those people as I said that we are responsible for. Our  they'll want to forget  that the Tories  programme and policies, they lied about taxes  they promised  not to extend V A T  they lied about protecting the value of pensions  well I hope the people who get the eight four P and the one twenty, the one's that the old dears will remember that because that's what they will be getting. That's what they will be getting  because I can tell this  to the Tories, let's be quite honest  that with the throw up  the the people  put their trust in the Tories  and I don't think they'll ever do it again. I hope that we will, I will debate even in this late hour, it's not too late to  debate this  very important issue and let the people out there know that we are thinking of them, not just about the things that happened early on today but least  that we are responsible enough to dis to discuss  this motion  and to press and press and press again so  the government, hoping the government will do a U- turn, if you don't you'll be gone forever. Thank you Chairman, I move. Have a seconder. Seconded  seconded Mr Chairman, reserve me remarks thank you. The serious item of news situ at the moment one day. Mr . Mr Chairman er  when we discussed this last time  er I expressed the view that in fact er  the county council had better things to do  I've not changed my mind erm since but I have been reminded that er  when er  the  Roman Emperors er  found ascension in the  ranks  when Roman Emperors found ascension in the ranks  they  provided bread and circuses  and I have to say that I regard the two notices of motion which were placed in Mr   notably fox hunting and this debate on V A T as  bread and circuses. It could be that er  he wishes to  distract attention between  the interesting arguments going on about one man one vote  which I'm pleased to hear that Mr  has won. Well it is remarkable that it's taken until nineteen ninety two for the Labour party to discover that democracy consists in one man one vote  rather than somebody holding up  holding up a card \\nsaying one and a half million votes. And  and it is also  perhaps distracted er  attention  from the  interesting disagreements also taking place at the Labour party conference this week between the  one more pushes, if I might describe them  and the  hard liners who believe you've got to be radical. Just wait for it. So having said that I thought that there were more important issues for the council to discuss, I don't think it'd be fair to let this  second debate on the subject pass without actually making a few er er a very short erm  a few short remarks cos I think we need to be clear about the issues. There is a need  to fund the deficit in public expenditure. Even that nice Mr Gordon Brown  doesn't pretend  that  a deficit on the public  borrowing requirement greater than fifty million  is sensible. Indeed  that nice  it's interesting to note that that nice Mr Gordon Brown  has just rec \\nHas just recently  withdrawn Labour's promise  to link pensions with average earnings. He recognises that there is a funding problem for public expenditure even if Labour members in this chamber don't  er and in case the erm  er  Liberal group is feeling sanctimonious. They should be aware that Mr  beat Mr Brown to the punch and did exactly the same thing  a few months ago. There is a serious question as to how reasonably  you should fund the deficit  and it is all very well to criticise  this suggestion as to how the a gap should filled without making any sensible suggestions of your own  and Mr Brown, nice Mr Brown so far \\nhas been singularly silent on the matter. The second fact issued before us and it's one that I referred to er when we did it, debated this last time  is that if members  do take seriously the whole question of   \\nNear time \\nof reduction  of er emissions then in fact you have got to reduce the consumption of erm  hydrocarbons  er as interesting as the Liberal party has said for years but now er pretends it had nothing to do with  erm, er V A T on fuel. One final quick note Chairman, there is no point complaining  that there has not been a cop copper bottomed guarantee. You're on time at the copper bottom. Mr  will find out whether or not there is a copper bottomed guarantee when the budget is announced and until then \\nTime please \\nuntil then\\nPlease Mr  please. his criticisms are entirely er er surplus to requirements. Mr . I didn't mind waiting. Alright, well the rest did. We have nine speeches including yourself. On a much more parochial level and I er I have an interest and I am one of these old age pensions that Mr  is determined to look after. Now the system at the moment seems to be  er suggested by the government that V A T should go up  and those that really need the money  will be if not wholly, mainly compensated, they will of course get another rise if the cost of living goes up because their pensions will go up. Mr  is very different  we must all be protected, I've worked out my bill as the same as this year because no way shall I spend seventeen and a half percent more money  I shall be as careful as I can and I shan't starve and I shan't get cold  now I've worked out that the V A T on my fuel bill  is eight hundred and eighty five pounds, I'd delighted if Mr  could perform the trick and I needn't pay it, on behalf of the Duke of Westminster, the Duke of Rutland, I think I can also thank him. This is not er  protecting that, no old age pensioner should pay these taxes  they should pay the taxes unless they're in need and be adequately taken care of. I must remind you that in Europe  that marvellous place with the social contract, hasn't prevented  everyone paying tax on on fuel. I think in Denmark it's twenty percent. Somehow we are different. I don't know why we're different except that someone wants to makes some trouble. If we come into line with Europe,le Europe will soon be putting pressure on us  by having a common policy and the policy to save fossil  er burning of fossil fuels is international. The Liberals said it must be done and done quickly  the Liberals said it must be done and done quickly, get extra tax on the fossil fuels for the sake of the environment. If you remember  you did say that. Er it's perf altered a little now because it's not very popular but that's what you've said. And I'm sure you've had a bit of thought about it, I'm glad you're see it there  er and the whole lot is a blessed mismatch, it's nothing to do with us though I do thank you Mr  for the help you wish to give me, the Duke of Westminster and the Duke of Rutland if this goes through as I said this today because without a doubt the government will listen to what you have to say and I've no doubt it will be effect. Mr \\nThank you Mr Chairman. There is a sense of er deja vu about all of this isn't there. One seems to have heard it all and I'm sure you've heard before that I've, I've to say. Er, I wondered about this erm  this Tory high flyer, about whom er, my friend over there speaks with such admiration and envy, he must have a tremendous influence  because I wonder, had he been the mover behind  the fact that  this V A T on fuel is is there in every other country in Europe including Ireland  where it's about eleven percent. So this Tory high flyer must be a very high flyer indeed. The truth of the matter is this of course, that Mr  might just as well put here any indirect tax, because that's what it's about. In one sense all indirect taxation is hardly equitable because it falls on the rich and the poor, like the old saying the rain, it raineth every day upon the rich and just and unjust fellow. But more upon the just because the unjust have the just's umbrella  but er this happens all the time. So there's no budget in picking out the f fuel for it. You might just as well pick out anything  but having done it and taking up, er what Mr  mentioned, this question I think it was Mr , about the deficit. There is a way of course, a classic way in which deficits trad can be  absorbed. You do it by having very high inflation. That's all is easy, it swallows up an inflation and in fact all those many years ago when there was a  a socialist government  seems a long since, like a bad dream now doesn't it, but when there was a socialist government, they did just this. They have high inflation, I might add to you that it had a far far more  damaging effect on poor old pensioners, like myself and I'm a war pensioner as well, poor old pensioners t to be serious, old people and  people of limited means who are affected far more  by the cure, the other cure that the Labour party tried that  that was high inflation, mind you I'm sure that they tried it, I think it just happened. It does with Labour parties  \\nThank you  \\nThank you very much, er I can't  carry along because you want to stop me, but if I were capable of telling, I'd say  my attitude is still the same as it was before. I'm glad you didn't mention the bank manager's umbrella. Mr   Mr  \\nThan thank you Chair. Very quickly in, what, what can I say, I mean it's an appalling situation  where you have a political party that believes that it can solve all the ills of these  the country that it has created in the last twelve years, I hope on the explicit  though I tend to think  renunciations are fairly clear here, but erm I hope you'll listen. That, that they have create these ills in the last decade through this, this increase in indirect taxation. Be  bec , the appalling thing is  that they're quite, they're quite happy to spread this pain on those who are in the least position to burden it  and they believe quite rightly and this, this is the  I think, that exists between socialism and  and and the Conservatism in that sense that  whereas  erm, you know opinion surveys bear out the fact that people are quite happy, those who can afford it  to pay a little bit extra in terms of direct taxation for those service provisions, which are absolutely  vital and these surveys have been conducted in public and they have been made quite er er open to the press, er, just before the last election  particularly for the health authority  and so forth. But I mean these, these surveys have indicated that the general public is quite prepared to give that little bit extra through direct t , through direct taxation, well listen, you you guys can't speak much after all there's only thirty one of you and there's thirty seven of us here let's face it. Er, but the interesting, the interesting thing is that they are prepared to pay and yet this obsession  this obsession with this ideology that the only way you can get  you can go forward in in terms of er  placing this this country in any economic status in the way it may have been and er  is is  to privatisation of V A T. Chairman I look forward to the day when  when the very air and this has been said for that we breathe  will either be privatised or more important they'll stick a bloody V A T on it. But it, isn't it an awful situation  when you, when you, when you look at it  that evidence indicates that the erm  the number of people that are either now elderly  infirm or sick  and  and clearly that they all will have to face this, this, this terrible burden  and I cannot understand because there is, this, there is, there is er a total disarray within the Conservative party, that all their er er back bench er MP s are  making representations to their  erm  their leader who possibly may not be a leader tomorrow but as long as he's the leader today, John Major  that he should do a rethink  and here they are  er  you know, members of the same party, continuing to support  something which is so  idiosyncratic that  you know it's really beyond belief, er Chairman. Not idiosyncratic. I think, well, clearly those people  those people who have  er  those who have some notion of decency  and particularly  even taking into account the mixed economy that we need to work in  will  support  er the notion that those people who cannot burden this  kind of tax  should not have to  er er should not have to partake. In actual fact it was mentioned earlier that V A T er could be imposed on fossil fuel but I think any administration . could clearly  make some kind of differentiation between a conglomerate  paying V A T or some such tax whereas er the exception could be made to those people who are not clearly in a position to make er er to say that. Ch Chairman I hope that the motion will get full support. Thank you. Er is there a  in the house? I, here he is. Mr Chairman  ladies and gentlemen, how's that. I wanted to say a word, I know you don't want me to. . Thank you, yes they should be  but  stand up and I'm only trying to help in the situation. Mr  you'll spoi you'll spoil us  when I saw this tonight I thought we I gotta say something because Martin  is coming up with the  er same motion as it was last time, it was not much different so  probably with the same reply's gotta be made and that is that  the Labour party is not the caring party, everyone here, I'm sure the Liberals as well as the Conservatives care  we are a caring party as much as you are  and we are concerned, we are concerned about, we are concerned about \\nthe old people and the people that are, are living on low incomes.\",\n",
       " \"I am an old age pensioner, you wouldn't believe that would you? I've struggled\\nI know what it's like  to struggle to pay .\",\n",
       " \"here, here. Thank you. You may think I'm joking  I don't go abroad for my holidays, I go to Norfolk. I can't afford to go on foreign holidays. Anyway, the point is this  that I am going to say as far as I'm concerned I'm gonna put all my maximum ability in making sure that this government stands by its obligation which it gave me  when I wrote to the Prime Minister because I was very very concerned that I did not want to see the old people and pensioners who was having difficulty in making ends meet, suffer further  and therefore I am with you when it comes to concerning yourself in relation to the O A P's or the pensioners or any one who is suffering because of the s seventeen and o half percent, the maximum is put on. So, I am looking after their interests. I don't need the Chief Executive to tell me what's happening because I'm going to be  involved in seeing what's happening and as far as the Labour people talking about the cost  it's going to create. You never said that when you were creating the cost, the cost of living which was inflation was soaring up to thirty percent, twice as much as what this bloody V A T will introduce. You were condemned of people then  you couldn't care a damn about it cos you couldn't do anything about it because your methods of running a country was a waste of time. Er, so as far as I'm concerned and I'm sure as far as you're concerned, we are battling this together. We maybe on different sides, but we want to make sure that the O A P s and the people that do have to er  er present th pay these bills, I mean if you consider  if you think of  Calor, Calor Gas, Calor Gas, the way that I actually heat my  I pay V A T on that, Calor Gas is is is V A T ed \\nNow, as far as  Conservatives are concerned, I speak myself and I'm sure everyone here would offer the same sympathy as the  the government has promised that they will do something about this.\",\n",
       " \"I promise that I will look into it and can I, can report back to you if you wish me to when it comes out. Doctor \\nThank you very much Mr Chairman. It's qu , it's quite. Can we just quieten down a bit please. Thank you. It's quite interesting that er  two members of the Conservative party have referred to these very high rates of inflation  er that happened under a Labour government er because  they, the, the reason they occurred  primarily, if you remember is because in nineteen seventy two  oil, oil was three dollars a barrel. In nineteen seventy three it went up to fifteen dollars a barrel and in nineteen seventy nine it went up to thirty dollars a barrel.\",\n",
       " \"Now that was. And what happened to him after that? Er  well he was unemployed for a quite some time  er and he got odd casual jobs  er  and then finally doing  er as late as the second world war he got er he got employment on the railway. Now did he have any er political or trade union affiliations? He had er some er trades union er some trades union experience. Er er he did attend his er the union branches,q er quite regularly. But he didn't have er  he didn't have any official er position within the union branch. And was he politically active or anything? Er  not really, no, not really that er  er political activity was left er to my mother. Yeah. She was er  she was politically acti active, er for the Labour Party . Could you tell me a bit about that? Yeah. Yeah. And erm  what kind of things was she involved in then? Well she was er very prominent in the er Labour Party War Organization,\\nMm. that old day they had a fairly er strong  er War Organizations locally, and she was er she was fairly active in there. And do you remember any experiences of your mother at election time or anything like that? Er well yes. Er,er  the main means of propaganda of course in those days was er leaflet and er street meetings. Er and I well remember er  even as early as nineteen nineteen  the election which took place immediately after world war one, I remember being  er sort of dragged round the streets,you know, er  I think it was enjoyable, I don't know  er by my mother, er attending these street meetings,er  I I I very well remember it because I had a a a new coat, a new coat for for er for this particular venture,and er the two things you know are fairly deep in my memory. Now,how did your family cope with your mother being sort of politically active, what did you how did you manage? Well, fairly well, fairly well. Er  erm, my older brothers  er they took an active part, immediately i in the early twenties. So it didn't seem to be of any hardship to to anybody for for the mother to be involved in er political activity. Mm. Did your father play er a role in  ? Er no no, he er er he did  er become an individual member of the Labour party at that stage, but he er he he didn't he didn't take er er an active er or organized part in it..\\nNow could you tell us a little bit about your brothers and sisters? How many did you have,? Well, I had my older brother,, er  he won some sort of a scholarship I remember, he became er  er part-time attendant at the er part-time attendant at the er university. Er . It didn't do him a lot of good  in the early er in the early days, but er it did stand him in good stead later of course because  he became er er a full-time official o of the er Notts area N U M.\\nThis was  wasn't it ? He was indeed. He he was one them, but who was er victimized in ninet after nineteen twenty six. He spent all his working life up until nineteen twenty six  er at the local Hucknall Colliery, but after twe er er twenty six, er he was victimized, he was dismissed, and was unable to get employment in the er in the industry, until er the latter thirties, middle thirties. After which he became a branch official and er and er subsequently became a er a full-time area official. Er another brother in the in twenty six, he he took another course of action, he he he cleared off and er he went to he went to live in Australia. Er  another brother he  er subsequently became a er er a Labour county councillor, but that er that was after the second world war, er after he had er after he had er done war service. But I'm quite sure his earlier associations within the family, er you know helped him in er in his endeavour to become a county councillor after the er after the second world war. Er well that leaves me. I also er I did have a sister\\nYes. and subsequently she was much younger. She she she went to Australia. And your elder brother you talked about at some length was Les, was it?? That's right, yeah. Er, and what about erm political affiliations? They're all you mentioned one was a county councillor, what about Les what w he was involved with  . Ah,L L Leslie, yes, he he he did a tremendous amount of work for the er er for the L Labour party. Er, he was indeed for some time the er secretary of the er er  divisional Labour party. Er, among other things. But er he did a fair amount of educational work, organizing er educational classes and so on. Er, so much so he was er able to  er  organize local weekend schools to which er people like Hugh Gaitskell, er would come and er give a couple of lectures, er Sunday morning, Sunday afternoon. Er, John , another one. Er  he was also closely associated with the National Council of Labour Colleges, who did indeed \\nMm. help in the organization of er  of these weekend schools. But er  immediately prior to the second world war, he did er he did er join the communist party. Now, so he was a p a n a political influence on you was he, er at some time  ? Er, well it was all mixed up, it was all mixed up, the funny thing is, er whilst he was many years my senior,er I joined the communist party before he did. So er er th th there were some er quite substantial er discussions and debates which er which er which went on in the family over the years of course. Now erm, tt could you just talk a little bit just about your you know y your background as a child? What what school did you go to? I went to a local er er council school. What was that called? That was er  er  Boys' School. And do you remember much about that? pardon? Do you remember much about that school?? Er well, not a lot. I remember there was er  er about forty eight of us in the classes, that er that went on. There was a very very strict er a very very strict discipline. Er  looking at it from today's standards, there was little  er little recreation. You know  er little physical recreation..\\nAnd what do y what sort of examples can you give about discipline then,harsh discipline? What what what sort of things went on? Er  well er I d I remember the er in the infants, er in the infants section it was necessary for to er for to touch y touch your hat, touch your little cap, er when the er when the headmistress when the headmistress er went by. Er and I think that somewhat sums it up. You more or less stood to attention..\\nNow erm  did you stay in the same school or? More or less, yes. Yeah. Er, the school had its infants department, and er intermediate and so on you see. And you went on and left school at what age? Fourteen. And what did you come to do then, when you erm\\nEr, well \\nleft school ? of course, jobs were at a premium then. Er, I got a job er in the butchery trade. Er, which er I suppose I was there for  for six years. But, many of these, er many of these jobs of course as far as the young people were concerned were dead end jobs. You got, nineteen twenty, twenty one, and that was it, they didn't want er they didn't want adults. Er you know they they only wanted er re really junior people. Now before we talk a little bit about that, I'll j can I just take you back erm a couple of years and ask you er what your memories are of the general strike? What do you remember about that ? About the general strike? Yeah. Er,one was er one was food. Er,at midday, at midday,w we er  er we reported to one of the local chapels. Er the majority of the local chapels were were w were responsible for er organizing soup kitchens for the kids, er S it didn't apply Sundays, it didn't apply Sundays. We got er a meal, mostly soup and a piece of bread,er at midday. Er  the chapel I attended was er the Baptist chapel on er on  Road. Er as I say, it  the majority of it was soup, but on one occasion during the week, we always had er  er some sort of mincemeat, er potted meat sandwiches and tea. And er I can taste the tea now. Er, it it had a peculiar taste with it. I don't know exactly what it was, but er er it was potted meat sandwiches er and tea. Now the other one, the other\\nWere you at school normally? During the strike? Oh yes, we were at school.\",\n",
       " \"Yeah. Yeah. Er the other one  was towards the latter end of the strike  and er this particular area, the Notts area,er had what was called broken away from the er from the main body er of the strike. There were some er some er miners in Notts who were persuaded er to go back to work. Er, as against the decision of the er of the union. And of course this created this created a a tr a tremendous problem, because er these few people that went to the er odd pits were in need of er a very strong police escort. And there were hundreds of police who were  drafted into the into the town,er billeted on the er local pubs, er and so on. And d it was the duty of these police to protect these er er these people, these scabs as they were called,er and escort them from their homes to the pit, and see them back. See them back home. Er and I remember er er a a very vivid occasion of being on  Road, which is close by the er Hucknall Colliery about three o'clock time, when er a couple of these er er people were being escorted back towards the centre of the town, after they'd done er a day's work  and there were lots and lots of er er er people about, men and women, who were shouting and jeering, at er at er at these at these people, who had been er who had er er violated the union decision and gone to work. And there were quite a large collection of police who stood in reserve up one of the side streets. And er anyway, the situation was getting out of hand, and er the man in charge, the the the the superintendent, whoever he was, he gave the signal that these that these reserves should er should clear the street to make way for the to make way for the scabs. And er they drew their truncheons, that  I'd never seen before, policemen with truncheons, er and they started to run  and everybody else started to run, and I forgot there was a puppy dog, this puppy dog it it chased it chased towards the er p policemen, and started er barking and d and carrying on, and one of the policemen did no more than thump it straight across the top of the head with a with a truncheon, and er and that was the end of the puppy. Well everybody everybody really  er began to scamper. Er, people would try front doors to see if they could get in front doors, but no,and they dived down er er er entrances between the between the houses and so on. Er, and all in all, it was quite er it's quite it was quite an experience, er er to have seen er this this er this police er er baton charge,er and er we were fortunate enough in in being able to to to get out of the way. Those are the two e are the two experiences the the question of food and the f er the s the soup kitchens, and the er er police protection for those who er er went to violate the decisions er of the union. Now about these these people, these blacklegs, what were they, were they local people, or were \\nOh yeah. they people drafted in? They were local people then? They were local people, yes. And what was the attitude over and above, other than obviously coming in and out of work, what was the attitude of the local neighbours and whatnot towards them ? Well er th er this is one of the misfortunes er is it not, you see, this bad feeling. This bad feeling er lived on into old age. Lived on into old age. Er \\nWhat were the kind of conditions of the people who w who went back in, did they go in  bec because of they had, erm say large families or something like that and they had difficulty trying to make ends meet? Er  I don't know whether that I don't know whether that was a factor, er er er looking back er er I wouldn't know. But there was a a I know there was a a system in Notts you see whereby  er  the coal was dug on the basis of contracts between the management and er a man or two men\\nMm. and these two men would employ half a dozen other men, you see, and whether w whether it was for to to to to get a foothold in the future for to be one of these contractors or not, I j I just don't know. You see. Now what about your own family, how did you manage, how did you make ends meet with the er four children ? Well we were fortunate, we were fortunate. Er, in so far that my father had been dismissed from the er from the coal mining industry, er before just before nineteen twenty six,and he was officially unemployed. So the family, we as a family were better off  than the majority of er of families  er in so far that er er whilst we were a a fair sized family, we did have at least some income, in the form of unemployment pay er that my father received. Mm. Er,my brothers brothers er older than me who were indeed er boys working in the pit, they didn't get, they didn't get any relief, or er any income. Did they did \\nExcept \\nthey or you have to get any c casual work, I mean y sort of part-time little jobs? Er\\n? Yeah, well, er they did a little bit of er  pea-picking. They went to Spalding area, pea-picking. And one or two er little odd jobs like this er for er  for the summer period, but er obviously these harvest jobs er didn't last very long. But there was a movement, there was a movement, because these single men had no income whatever,and there was a demonstration of er of these er single men, they marched to the workhouse, er in Baseford. Er,the city, not the city, the the Baseford Hospital. Er they they they marched, you see they'd no income, they'd nothing. They they marched to the er to the workhouse, demanding that they should be taken in, you see. Er, on the basis that er that er that er they were destitute. But they were not allowed in because. A they couldn't er they couldn't get er th they couldn't provide accommodation for all the hundreds that they were, you see. And B of course er the political set up was such that they were not interested  er in helping er the miners over this er over this particula particularly difficult er period. And why do you think was that? They di they didn't want to feed those on strike, they wanted to try and get them back to work did they? Er, yeah, well, one one can appreciate in er in in circumstances of real hard struggle,\\nYeah. the likes of which the twenty six strike was, you see, there there was no er there was no holds barred. .Y your political affiliation was either one way or the other, and er er er you didn't er you didn't m mince words about it, did you not, I mean you . You didn't show you didn't show any er er either any enthusiasm or sympathy for the other side. Now what about other members of the of your family? Were they active in in organizing in, in participating in the picketing and this kind of thing,? Yes, oh yes, they were er they were involved. So much so of course that er that er the the elder brother, he was er he was er a branch official by this time, twenty six, at the er Hucknall Colliery, the local colliery, and of course when the strike er was over, er that was the end of he as far as working in the in the coal mining industry in this particular area, that was the end of it. They er  they just had their blacklists and er and er that was it, you you you were out, and you weren't going do er, you know, you were not allowed to have another job. Now I don't know if you remember anything  about the nine days of the General Strike, as opposed to the s sort of the whole miners' strike in that year. Yeah. Do you remember anything special about \\nYeah. those nine days?\",\n",
       " \"Yeah. In comparison to  ? Yeah, well er yeah, there was there was er one er  er course er er we kids w looked upon er er these activities w with some with some interest you know? Er for example it was better than going to school. And  th the local there was a local brewery, now I I can't quite remember which brewery it was, during the er during the General Strike,they er they decided to er to send out barrels of beer.\",\n",
       " \"Er . Obviously to the to one of their pubs. And the vehicle got as far as Hucknall Marketplace,er  and that was it. The it was halted there,and er all the barrels of ale were were were  were rolled off,we were rolled off the vehicle. And er  they were just  they were just in the in the act of of of tapping of tapping a couple of these barrels, and er i it was unfortunate that the that the police showed up. So consequently,th there was no er ,the there was no free beer. But I ve I ve I very well remember that one. Er  I remember too er  there was some attempt made to stop a train, which er which was run  er on what was then known as the Great Central Line, that runs through, that runs through Hucknall. Er I know that there was quite a business about this, but er I wasn't an eyewitness, er and I didn't er I'm never so sure that er I I didn't get the I didn't get the details right. Er it seems it seems that there were a lot of students, from one of the bigger un er er top class universities  which were handling this train,er  but er there were quite a few er things done, some of them I would think dangerous. But er apparently, er this train whilst it was halted, it was halted locally, but after a while it er it er it did get away, and it proceeded towards er towards er Sheffield. What happened above  er above Hucknall er I just don't know. Now  if we er if we can just move on move on back to your  tt starting your working life,\\nYeah. Erm, and y you er said that you that you started work in a butcher 's. W did you have a proper apprenticeship? Not re No. No. No proper training? Oh no, no. And what were y What were the kind of jobs that you were expected to do then? Well, er there was er  er keeping the place cleaned, er there was er  doing deliveries work, there was er the making up of er certain items, sausage, er etcetera, er and you were also ex expected to help in the er in the slaughterhouse. Er and you sort of er er a general labourer actually, but you picked up some knowledge, some knowledge of the of the er business. What er what sort of wages were you getting for that? Well the wages then was er w started at er ten shillings, ten shillings a week, that's fifty P a week, you see. And wh how did that compare with other lads of your age? Was that good or bad? Oh er now th that was that was that was pretty poor, er  probably employed in the co-op in those days, would would have attracted er er er a fourteen shillings, er nearly half as much again. Er, perhaps in the mining industry, you would have got er thirteen shillings, something like this. And what sort of hours did you have to work then? Shop work, is that a long, how long a day would you have? Oh hours, it was er it was er six er six full days a week,seven in the morning to six at night that is. Er. Now, er if we could come on a little bit, erm, tt when was it that you became sort of officially politically active, when you actually joined  er joined the party? Oh well that would be the er  I was a member of the er I was a member of the trades union whilst I was in this private distribution. There weren't many others, er perhaps only four more er in the in the town, but we were associated with the with the er branch which looked after the interests of the co-op employees. Er  but er political affiliations,er serious political affiliation, that that would start about nineteen thirty one, or perhaps nineteen thirty two. And and what did you join? Well I joined the I joined the Young Communist League at that stage. And er if we could just go into a little bit about, this was in Hucknall? This was in Hucknall, yeah . . What what  erm  what sort of activities did you organize then, what sort of thi events did you  ? Well we did er we did a fair amount of er er leaflet er distribution. Er,there were one or two of us, not many  we helped the er Communist Party branch proper, in their campaigns for er council elections, er sales of the er of the Daily Worker, as as as it was known er in those days. Er,we had a fair amount of activity supporting the s marchers  of the er unemployed. Er, I would think we made ourselves generally useful. Probably too much so on the political side,in so far that er er looking back, it seems that w w we were isolated from other young people, in so far that we were associated with straight political er activity and er straight political movement . Mm. Well why w would why would you say that, what what s what s was your sort of membership, where from what groups of people did you draw your members from? Well, they were much the same, local workers. Er, a couple of lads who were who were unemployed, er  we were never able to break in the mining industry, at this particular stage. We were never able to er we were never able to get young miners  er in these  in the very early days immediately after nineteen twenty six onwards, to er to  er to be associated with the er Young Communist League.\",\n",
       " \"And why do you think that was? Was it was it  or would you say it was  ? Well er this wa this was this was this was very clear, this was very clear you see. When you look back, when you look back  you see, erm, understand  that after nineteen twenty six, at the local pits,if you if you took a watch, if you took a watch to work with you,so that you're in a position  to know the time, and tell the other people what the time was, you see, you were running the serious risk  of losing your job. Now this, this may  this may appear , this may this may may be a this may appear to be a a a something farfetched, might this. This is exactly what the situation was. Because they developed a system  of mining, whereby  once once it was  the the the task had begun to clear the coal face  of a certain er a certain area of coal,it didn't matter what what happened during that particular period of time, whether all the machinery broke down, etcetera, etcetera,you had to stop u until that amount of coal had been cleared off, you see. And they were not having anybody in the mine, with a watch, who could let people know exactly what the time was, and in other words, create a situation where the men might go home before they'd completed this particular task. But that that indeed er was the situation. Er so much so, you see that er er er people who did have employment in the industry would not, would not be seen talking to left-wing Labour party people, or members of the Communist party, because they readily understood, you know, that here was a risk that they were running, whereby they may indeed lo er er lose their employment. Er and so the therefore you see, these are some of the reasons why w we were unable to get close to the er er er younger members, who were or or or the younger people who were employed in the coal industry. Now,\\nHowever, the situation was changed later on. Er  what was your relationship with people, as you say, on the left in the La in the Labour party? With the Labour party generally? Or w or and with the youth in the I L P and the Labour \\n. party with their youth sections, what was your relationship with them? Well the funny thing was that er the local Labour party  n didn't have didn't have a youth er a youth section. It were shame, it were shame that those who would er have been the youth section in  in the Labour party locally were we people, who were who were in the Youth Communist League, you see. Er  but the relationship with the er with the Labour party, and particularly the left in the Labour party, was not er was not too bad at all. Was not too bad at all, because  er d d d everybody was inv involved in some sort of endeavour, either er er through the unions, or through the  er demonstrations against unemployment, you see, so there there was indeed er a a certain coming together. Er when the election, local elections were on of course, er er er  i we were n not quite so friendly to each other , because er each had got candidates er contesting for the er for the same er for the one er particular seat. How wh what sort of how  how did that feel, then er er one minute you were fighting together on er an unemployed \\nMm. demonstration, and the next minute you were fighting against \\nMm. one another, what er wh did that cause any personal antagonism? Er, only in very very odd cases. Only in very odd cases. Er  I don't think er  the L on the left it didn't much matter, on the left it didn't much matter, er er er er the right-wing types were probably not so er not so very happy about the situation. Now, you've you've talked about these activities, erm,. And wi and parliamentary-wise, you see,\\nYes. there was a er a fairly good er  fairly good er M P, a fellow named Seymour Cox. Er, he was not a brilliant orator, er but er by and large he was er he was er he he he was he he was a pretty good and well respected er member of parliament. Erm,if we can just talk a bit about the the the activities, the question of the demonstrations against unemployment, what did you actually do to to aid those demonstrations? Were these the national marches as well as local ones? Oh yes. The national marches er the the er the Yorkshire the Yorkshire contingent  er would come through here. Er  and when the Yorkshire contingent didn't come through here, you'd get the er er er Notts er contingent, which er would join up with the Derbyshire contingent, er a wee bit a wee bit lower down, wee bit lower down the er er down the country, so er in every er in every er activity against er unemployment, they'd the locals who were who were obviously involved. And what sort of things did you actually do to help the national hunger marchers then? What practical support did you give them? Er  well we'd er er distribute the leaflets, we'd er do what was known as the whitewashing, in other words, er er er whitewash slogans, whitewash times of meetings,whitewash the announcement of er er times of arrival, er and things of this character. And what about their accommodation and things like that, did you or or the food, did you do anything like that ? Er invariably the co accommodation was er was provided in the in the local halls, there were two local halls in those days, but er primarily the public hall,wi that was the local council hall. Er, this er provided the er this provided the accommodation. They all slept there, you know, they s th they they they slept rough. But it was warm, er and er meals were provided for them. And do you have any specific memories of er the hunger marches? Because it must be thirty two and thirty six, mainly you'd be talking about wouldn't it? Yeah. Early thirties, yes. The two main ones. And what Do you have any sort of memories that you can  describe  of of the marches in  coming to  ? Er  I remember one I remember one demonstration, we were able to er  we were e employed you see, er we we didn't we didn't participate in the er in a national march, but what we were able to do on one occasion was er to raise enough money for one or two of us, for to er go to London by the train, and er be in Hyde Park when er the er the various contingents from e er from various areas er of London, marched er marched into er marched into Hyde Park. And er  it was quite er it was quite something you see  to see these er thousands of er of er and they were well-disciplined, er in demonstration, with banners, with their elected leaders at the front, march into er march into er er Hyde Park, er they had bands playing, they had er er perhaps er fifteen or sixteen platforms, you know from which the er  various working class leaders er er spoke, to I don't know how many people,wh who er who who would be in H Hyde Park on on on on er on this particular day. But er  as much as anything, that in itself was er er one of the ai you know one of the er high points that the er I remember of this particular period. Hyde Park erm was it to see the arrival of the hunger marchers, can you remember what year that was? I can't no, I can't. And er\\nEr  it could have been thirty two er er er. Now  can you remember any of the local initiatives, or any of the local activities that took place against unemployment? What what sort of things that went on. Erm  well there was er there was the local organization for the unemployed, the national union, the er national unemployed workers' movement. They they had a very strong well-organized er well-organized branch locally. Er  and these people er understood what could be got f er  what little bits could be got out of the er various unemployment er acts, and er  this knowledge, er plus the pressures and feelings that were able to be brought to bear, I'm quite sure did er did benefit many er many people who who were unemployed. Er, for example, er whilst people w were getting what er the unemployment act said they should have, er this pressure was er I'm quite sure, able to get some additional er benefits even if it was er only in kind, er from the from the local authorities. Now wh erm  can you remember any of the sort of i initiatives, I mean did anything take place in Hucknall? Er  not beyond not beyond the er  the marketplace the er marketplace meetings. Er, summertime, good weather,the these meetings were a feature of er the you know the political lie, er in the wintertime, similar meetings and activities were undertaken er in the public hall, er in in in the local hall. But er er exact er victories if you  in that respect, it's hard to it's hard to say whether they were any. And er how how many people did you get at at these street meetings in the marketplace ? In the public i in the marketplace? Yeah. Ooh, round about er three hundred. Yeah. Oh yes, it was, you could get a meeting there, you could get a meeting there. And there was interest, there was heckling, there was er er er etcetera etcetera, you see? And it had been known that er the Tories that the Tories through the medium of er the economic league, you know, their their propaganda organization, the economic league, which was er which was substantially supported by the by the coal owners\\n. Yeah. obviously, er they th they'd been known they'd been known to come, er and try and have a meeting. They they usually didn't finish it, but er they started,so er there was a fair amount of er of er of er interest in the marketplace. Now you you told me er er before about this er the unemployed used to gather weekly in in in the in the public hall, what \\nYeah. was this? What what took place at these meetings? Well, they would have a er they would have a singsong, they would have er their own er er local artists, you know, er\\nWhat would that be, not just sort of Play School songs, it would be anything would it?.\",\n",
       " 'Anything, anything, anything.',\n",
       " \"Oh yes, yes. Anything. Er instrumentalists, local instrumentalists  but er overall of course it er i i i i it was the er er unemployed workers' organization. And was there any sort of political activities organized then? Erm, meetings or classes or anything like that? Yes, there was er  a fair amount of er straight political er er education. Er, for example classes were, my mother organized some classes, other people organized classes. Er  for example, I remember in , a couple of miles down the road, in the er  Hall,there was er there was weekly classes on er among other things on Marxian economics, you see. We had no money in our pockets, but er we're talking about er er er economics, and Marxian economics at that , er and funnily enough the chap the chap who did that, er Bert , he was unemployed, he was he was one of the fellows from Derbyshire who was victimized in Derbyshire. Er, he was a lecturer, and er er a couple of fags and he was a couple of cigarettes and he was he wa he wa he was er quite well quite well er r rewarded. But he, he became he became the area secretary, of the Derbyshire miners er Derbyshire miners organization. Er, and you've got er you've got er political er educational classes, similar to this, both in Hucknall, er and in the and in the surrounding area. And did you, even though you were employed, did you actually participate  ? Oh yes, yes yes. Er,of a Friday evening, of a Friday evening, er I would attend er er a national council of labour colleges lecture, a fellow named  u u us us used to run this one. Er,and then   er I also attended er er political discussions and lectures which were laid on er by the communist party as well. And this went on for years this? Oh yes, over a long period. Over a long period. Now, what about your your life outside of work, and outside of political activity, did you have much leisure activities? Er  not really. I er I was a keen cyclist. Er, mind many people, many people relied on the cycle er for to get about you see. Er if we attended if if we were due to attend a meeting for example in in in Derby, er er  twenty mile away? Er, well, you went on a bike, you see. Er er if if you er er if you attended were to attend er a meeting in Nottingham, you went on your bike, or Mansfield you see. Er  and apart from them, I was er I was er I was a fairly er keen er cyclist, and did er did a little bit of camping too. But er  \\nRight. Where did you used to go? Why what did you used to do? Er  well we had a camp, the Youth Communist League had a camp down at er a place called Lamley Dumbles,that was er that was not far er not far from  Colliery. Er  quite a successful camp that, quite a successful camp. Er what sort \\nfifty or sixty er er of a weekend, you know who who would attend, who would attend that. And what sort of things did you get up to? Er  well we had er  er  a very fine er er wind-up gramophone, and we had some marvellous records. Some er some very good erm records  I should say decent music. Er \\nWhat do you mean by that, decent music? Pardon? What do you mean by decent music? Well, er you'd get er light opera, and er er and er you know Gilbert and Sullivan and and and and and \\nYeah. and this sort of thing. Er which was er which was always er which was always enjoyable. Mm. Er  apart from, you'd get a ramble, you know y y you'd go along for for for for a ramble, er my most most of the time was er made up er by er cooking your grub, you know ? Mm. Messing about with the wi wi with the er food. Now, what about other things? I mean did you ever have time for dances, and going to the pictures and that kind of thing, I mean you must have found some time ? Er, well that that kind of thing, that \\nAs a young man. that was always a question of money,\\nYeah. you know, and er you just didn't er you just didn't have er er y you may get a cinema once a week, or perhaps a dance once a week, but that er that wa that was the limit, you know. But you ma you managed to fit in some other sort of \\nOh yes. social life over and above it, as a sort of relax , you know,\\nYeah, yeah. yeah? That was what I was trying to get at. And then you know so l try and bring that on,y you erm you got married in the thirties,\\nThat's right. and how did you get round to to meet your wife then? Well she was er er she was involved with er er the cooperative youth organization, known as the er Co-op Comrades Circle. Er, and all all of these organizations, you see, one way or another, their paths crossed and er erm people met people this way. And can you remember how exactly you met your wife? Er  I don't know, er I don't know I'm not er I do er I had this brother, I had this brother, and he was er he was a lecturer you see, and he was supposed to g go to West Bridgford to talk to this Co-op Comrades Circle on the problems of the Saar. Er I I don't know whether you know about the Saar? That that the area in Germany you mean? That's right. Yeah. Between France and Germany you see. And he sent me to tell them he couldn't come, you see.\",\n",
       " \". Er and i something like this. And so you met your wife there? , aye. Erm, and how long was it before you got married? I don't know really, I married in er  early thirty six, er er er\\nNow, your your wife wasn't a member of the communist party? She was by this time. Yeah? Er\\nWha what did she think by er she was a member before she got, before she married then?\",\n",
       " \"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Er so she was she wasn't bothered at all about your er\\nOh no no no, no no . your activities when you first started. So how did you er manage when you first got married then? Did your wife work at all? Yes, well she she er she did a bit of work and er we lived \\nWhat what job did she do? in a comparatively comparatively cheap er cheap little flat, with er some other party members you see. So we were \\nWhereabouts  Hucknall? this was in ba the exact centre of Hucknall. Er near the marketplace, overlooking the marketplace. But of course er that's gone now, that that's all gone now, and by one means or another we were able to er to er live comfortably, anyway. And your wife was from West Bridgford originally, was she? Yeah, yeah . Yeah. Well she lived down there, but she originates from Derbyshire,. And w er  did sh you said she got some work, what what job did she do then to help? Erm, mostly of a domestic nature. And you were still working in the butchers' at this time?\",\n",
       " \"That's right. That's right. Now, er if we could come on now, it was in nineteen thirty six that you went to Spain? Well, it was thirty seven. Thirty seven was it ? Yeah. Erm,now can you tell me about how you how you decided to actually, you know why you decided to actually go to Spain  in the first place? Well er you see, the b the the the political background, er  played a very important part,er  and the fa and the struggle against fascism  in this er  early thirty period, was er was really something. Er  it's difficult for people to appreciate today er  the amount of political activity that took place during this early thirty period, and it's pe difficult for people to appreciate the political understanding that did exist over this period. And not only political understanding, but  political determination to do something about it. And the er the er struggle of the Spanish people r really captured the imagination  of er huge sections of the er of the majority of the people er er in Britain. And you'd got you'd got a tremendous buildup you know of er of enthusiasm, of determination you see, er and obviously er people wanted to give er expression to their support to the maximum. Er people quite a f few people went to er er went to Spain. Bef before I went, er I er quite a few of my friends went. You see, and it's er it er it's this j this background you see which er er  er convinced people that er they ought to you know help the Spanish people in a real, serious, and er and personal capacity. Because they'd got a tremendous struggle on, they'd got a tremendous struggle on, they were struggling against tremendous odds,they were struggling against er er all sorts of er er of er of trickery, that er was being conducted by quite a quite a few of the er quite a few of the major powers. And it was this background you see that er that er th th that gave me at least the need for to to play some some part in \\nMm. helping along the struggle against er er against fascism. Now did you go with friends? Did you go with you know your friends and comrades at the time? Well, I er er I picked up I picked up er I picked up people in London, but , locally locally er I went er individually. I went on my own. How did you know people had gone before you though?. Well we got letters back, we\\nYeah. Your\\n. your friends had gone, though, you  had gone . Oh yes yes yes. Er in fact in fact, a a c a couple of them are o er b were killed there. Er er one from Mansfield, er one from Nottingham. Now can you tell me a bit about you your your journey down there? Er we were well it it it was fairly well-organized, it was fairly well-organized it was er. Well how, you you got to London did you? And then ? Yeah, you're in need of er you're in need of er getting to London. Er, and to get to London, probably the local people would help raise the er would help raise the fare, but having er  er having got to London, er you contacted the organization, er  you would then  took a er weekend ticket, took a weekend ticket to er to Paris. This was a, you know, a return er a return ticket. Cost about one pounds twenty five, or the equivalent of one pounds twenty five P.\\nBut er you got to Paris, you got an address in Paris, they gave you a bed,couple of meals \\nNow who who ga who supplied the money? Were you given the money or did you have to pay for that yourself? Oh no, you er  they er provided the ticket, you see, they provided the ticket. Mm. Oh there was no such thing  if they gave you the money, you might nip off..\\n. No, they they provid they gave you the tickets you see. Mm. How we got there, er you you you got er you got some food, ad you got a bed for er for a couple of days. Er, you then had got another ticket, and er  train ticket, and you went to the south of France by train,and er  you got a bed and a couple of meals there er then you had a bus ride. They provided a bus, you had a bus ride and you picked up a couple of guides er, who during the night would take you over the er take you over the er Pyrenees, er over the mountains er, the Pyrenees, you see becau er you're in need of a guide because the er the frontier posts etcetera etcetera were shut, were closed. Er, and they were also guarded. And er you were in need of er er finding a way over the Pyrenees which er gave you a chance of er getting to the other side, so hence er you needed er you needed French er er French guides. And they were guarded by Franco's troops? Pardon? They were guard guarded by Franco's troops? Ah well you didn't go over, you didn't go over er where Franco's troops were, but \\nMm. they were guarded by French troops, you see .\",\n",
       " \"I see. Yeah. Er there was not a lot of enthusiasm  for this er th this guarding which went on you see, because everybody was in sympathy  er with the cause of the republican government, the S the Spanish republican government. Now,\\nSo it was er only half-hearted as far as er as far as the er the er activities of the guards on the frontiers from the French side were concerned. Now, where did you go to once you were in Spain? Well, we went to a place called Figueres \\nThat's just inside er that's just inside, er just inside Spain, what \\n. they have it's a it's an old an old fort, from the grander days of the er history of Spain yeah. And er from there, from there we we er we were er we were obviously then enrolled there, and we then went to er a training base of Albusate \\nNow how \\nmore or less in the er almost in the middle of Spain. Tt how long had the erm journey took you then from from from Nottingham down to Albusate \\nFrom here to to er republican territory? Yeah. Perhaps six days. And it was quite short then? The er  . Oh yeah yeah, it was quite short, yeah. Yeah. Now what happened when you got to er Albusate the me ? This was what was there, it was the international brigade ? Well that was the that was the er base headquarters of the international brigade,Albusate And then from there,w you were farmed out to the village, which was er er sort of the base, who are responsible for your er particular national battalion, you see er, the the the French people, they they er w they would be in one village, the English and the Canadians er er Americans would be er  in this place that we were at, called Tarrazona Er and the Germans w , the German anti-fascists would be er in another. Er like wh when I was with the It er the Italian anti-fascists, you see. And what er How many different nationalities were there then?? Well, you you you name the nationality and they were there, you see. They were a everybody was there. And not just Europeans? Oh no, no. Who who from outside of Europe ? No, there were there were Indonesian, there were there we the the there were Chinese, there was er the there were Mexicans, there were er Ce people from er Central America, South America, from everywhere. Now, given the different nationalities,wa wasn't there a communication problem? Language problem? Well, er er there there al there always is, isn't there? There is a there is but er  er but er er the medium er er as best it could be used was was Spanish you see. See? And it's surprising the number of people er who do speak Spanish. You see, because everybody everybody from Mexico, right down to the er to the tip of South America, for example,er speak one dialect or another  of er of er of of of of Spain, of the Spanish language, and large areas of er  of er the Indes  you see, er  and Italian is not  a long way from it, you see, so er er er it it on the surface it may seem to have have been difficult, but the er you know there we we we did get by. Did you manage by pick did you pick up a few words yourself? Ah, yes, just a few. Everybody managed by \\nYeah.\",\n",
       " \"doing that did they? Yeah, yeah. And er what what was the point, it was like a training camp as well was it? That's right, yeah. Now what what kind of er training did you get? Well er we  got we got the use of er er of rifles, you know, there weren't many, because they were wanted er they were wanted at the er front. There were one or two rifles they were er, you know,\\n. so we did indeed get some basic er basic military training. We fired rifles, and and and and and this and this sort of thing. Er, we did er you know practise military formations  as they were as they were practised in er in those days and so on. So we did er we did indeed get some er basic military training. Erm  what about your standard of living? What what kind of food did you get, and where were you living at the time? Er,well there was always a problem er food-wise, because there was a scarcity, there was a sc an overall scarcity  er of food. Er  er  and the Spanish coast, you see, was blockaded. You see it was er whilst it was er er a democratically, legally elected government, you see there were such people as er er as Mussolini, from Italy, fascist Italy,and er er er  Hitlerite Germany you see, who had got units, naval units, air units etcetera, blockaded. Blockaded the er er the ports of er of republican Spain. And consequently, er  the blockade did have er did have serious er serious consequences for the imports in relation to food etcetera, that er that were required by the er by the republican government. So what sort of \\nI remember there was one fellow, er an Englishman, he was known as Potato Jones. He used to he used to run his own ship, er a little coastal a little coastal er er vessel. Er, and he he used to run he used to run food to er the   in er in this in this boat, a fellow named Potato Jones, I don't know why he was known as Potato Jones,\\nEr was was he politically inclined, was he  \\nEr this I don't know, this I don't know, but er \\nor was it a bit of opportunist entrepreneur ? Yeah.

Er  but this er that was a that was a er decision of the er er of the German command, of the German army that was in Spain. But after the war,w we went back er under the er under the control of the Italian army. Okay so last week we looked at the participatory model of democracy which in essence of  Russo's Theory in three ways. First of all, it allows much more room for debate, discussion, dissension, even disobedience in Russo's Theory. a consequence of giving up the assumption that there's at least an easily recognizable general will. So either you say there's no general will or there is something like a general will, but it is not easily recognizable and for either reason you would want to be much more tolerant of the role minorities, either as a way of getting to the truth, or erm as a way of as it were making up the truth as you're going along. So that's the first difference between participatory model and Russo's model there's much more room for debate and consequent toleration of minority. Secondly, it gives up the distinction between sovereign and the executive in the sense that the people are not restricted only to making laws, but they can also get involved in decisions about particular acts of will. So for example, er on Russo's model we saw the people are not consultive on the issue of whether the State should go to war or not, because that's a particular act and must be left to the executive. In the participatory democracy the people would certainly decide that . The third difference was that the participatory model and it is perhaps the most distinctive about it, extends democracy to other institutions of civil society, including the family, the workplace, local governments and so on. Now I discussed three objections to the participatory model last week. The first one is John Stuart Mill's objection which is that we can't leave everything to the people. At some point individuals must administer, you can't have a committee carrying out the\\ncommittee. You must need some individual point by that committee and the same is true for governments. So it is not possible, not practically possible to leave everything to the people. We'll come back to that objection. The second objection was the problem of agenda setting in a participatory democracy. How is it that the people come to be discussing certain issues\\nrather than other issues? How do those issues get decided and I thought there's no sensible answer. Thirdly there's the old objection of participatory democracy that it simply takes up too much time and this is not a trivial objection, because the thought is not that it's simply time-consuming, but because it's so\\ntime-consuming, it's destructive of other things we value so that we value er artistic creation, enjoyment, conversation and so on. These things, there would simply be no time left for\\nerm in political decision making. Okay, so much for last week. This week I want to start by reconsidering that first objection but we can't leave everything to the people. At some point we need administrators to carry out the will of the people. Now the defenders of participatory democracy would consider this as a very weak objection. What they would say is that we have to, perhaps we do have to leave things to the individual, but we should leave as little possible to individuals, as little as practically possible so that we should the people involved in making all the important decisions, particularly the carrying out of them that we have to leave to particular appointed individuals. So erm we can cast this  in a different context. We've got really two things in play here, one is the role of individuals who administer and the other is the role of the people, so we have a question of what is the proper role of the people and what is the proper role of the individual administrators. We've seen the answers from participatory democracy as little as possible to the individuals as much as possible to the people. At the other extreme we have something like Plato's system, where the people are given no role at all and everything is left to individual experts, individual administrators, so Plato's system is at one  everything is left to the individuals, participatory democracy\\nas little as possible is left to individuals. Somewhere in the middle we have Russo's system where the people make laws but no do nothing else  everything else is left to appointed individuals. There's a fourth possibility that we haven't looked at yet  and this is a possibility of representative government where the people simply elect lawmakers, the people don't make laws they elect the people to make laws. So in this case the people who carry out the will of the people make the laws on behalf of the people. So representative government gives some role to the will of the people, some role to the individual to individuals, but erm in a way less role\\nto the will of the people than participatory democracy or Russo All the individuals do is elect their governors, so this is the  idea that Russo called not democracy but that to of aristocracy. We vote in a group of people who then in this view, Mill's view take laws on our behalf. They also appoint administrators to carry out those laws. So this is a much more familiar model of democracy to us than any of the others that we've seen so far\\nand for Mill, representative democracy was the only way democracy could survive in the modern world. He  particularly was concerned about problems of scale as a practical problem, that is it may well be in a small town you could have a direct democracy, a face-to-face community where people can talk to each other and argue with each other and meet on a regular basis, but as soon as you get cities, countries, nations,direct democracy of any sort  is erm absurd\\nWell and we have seen one  response for people now making  Mill that is that his objections are not being finessed by computer technology, they don't want to get back into that type of argument, because this is really not the most important argument against direct democracy. To understand Mill's view or at least to see why Mill makes the argument he does make, er I E not just the argument  but other arguments which represent democracy. We have to understand first of all what Mill thinks the proper function of government\\nand in his view governments have two roles. There are two things that governments ought to be doing. Firstly they ought to  improve the citizens, both morally and intellectually, so it's the role of the government to make better citizens. Secondly they have to manage the affairs of government well, or rather erm, so they have to manage the affairs of the state. What does this second claim come to what is its  state of the affairs of the state well, well we should assume that Mill ultimately  utilitarian standard so that erm  to manage the state's affairs well is to maximize general happiness. However, it's surprising that in on representative government utilitarianism barely surfaces and that almost no mention at all is made of utility apart from in a very general way. However erm so two things to say about that, I think we can assume \\nwill ultimately apply utilitarian standard, but he doesn't make much of it here and he relies on a much more intuitive idea of what  manage things well and he assumes that different branches of government will have different standards of success and that we will be able to tell pretty much whether they're doing well or badly. Now this is rather a banal claim I suppose that erm the proper function of government is to manage things well, I mean who would have doubted that, but the other claim that governments, one of the roles of governments is to improve the citizens is more surprising, particularly for a liberal view  and there's a more standard liberal position now would be that the moral well-being citizens is not a proper matter of governmental concern. Or they should, the citizens should be er stopped from er attacking each other and so on, but whether the citizens turn out to be morally good or morally bad in other ways in private matters, whether they're morally improving or not, is simply not the business of governments. It is surprising to hear that Mill doesn't hold this view that he thinks that  erm  the moral health of the citizens is of concern to the government and it actually gives, although he doesn't seem to recognize this, this gives a hostage to fortune to his conservative critics because of course they can say, did say that liberalism was very damaging of er morality of the public and so we need a far more restrictive type of regime than Mill allows us. And anyway I'm going to leave that on one side now because it's more erm a problem to reconciling Mill's views about liberty with his views about a proper government rather than directly about governments, so I'm just going to note that and move on now. Okay well suppose that erm Mill is right that these are the two proper functions of government. Given that he thinks he can demonstrate, easily demonstrate the advantages of representative governments to show why\\nis far better than any alternative. First of all he contrasts representative democracy with what he calls enlightened despotism which is really something like places guardianship. Now Mill concedes that the guardian, the despots might manage the affairs of the state tolerably well that there's no reason of principle why a very enlightened despot couldn't do fairly well, although Mill claims that no despot could do as well as a good democracy. I found it hard to find Mill's arguments for this, although he seems to be, he seems to be arguing the point over several pages, but erm we get pretty much rhetorical claims and  evidence and so he wants us to consider those states which have been ruled by despots with those contemporary states which have been democracies  England versus Spain say and he thinks it's obvious which type of system we ought to prefer. But he's got no, as far as I can see he's got no convincing argument that democracy will do better, but that doesn't matter because he thinks that the decisive criticism of enlightened despotism is that it won't improve the moral or intellectual well-being of the citizens, but if people are excluded from political decision making, they will have no incentive to educate themselves or morally improve themselves, or he thinks if they do, if a despot does allow for the moral improvement of the citizens, then citizens will no longer accept despotism so that despotism is in a way self-defeating here and if it   one of the proper functions of government it can't survive. No morally and intellectually well educated people will be prepared to tolerate despotism rather than democracy. So that's Mill's argument against enlightened despotism. More interesting is his implicit comparison with direct democracy. Now he doesn't actually make the concession I think it's consistent of what he says, that he ought to concede that direct democracy might be better at improving the citizens, because after all the citizens have much more to do on in service of the state  but his view is that direct democracy has the opposite failure to guardianship, that while it might be better at improving citizens it's absolutely hopeless in managing the affairs of the state and his reasons for that is that we need experts with experience in order to carry out the affairs of government and although these people ought ultimately to be held responsible to the people, people shouldn't sit in judgment  them in every one of their decisions. So here he has erm quite a long discussion in the fact that if you have inexperienced people, they will often make the make a quick initial assessment of a situation which is being  and rejected by a more experienced person. So the experienced person will always be able to take the inexperienced person, it's not as simple as that, but if you make the administrators responsible to the people in all their decisions, then you have as Mill says inexperience sitting in judgment on experience, ignorance sitting in judgment on knowledge. So you have to insulate the, the administrators from direct control of the people if you, if the administrators are going to make good decisions. The people just have to trust the administrators at a certain point, rather than trying to  er  second guess all of their decisions. So a direct democracy will lead to a very inefficient running of the state. Therefore representative democracy presents itself as the best compromise. It can manage the affairs  of the state very well and it can improve the citizens. Well how does it do that? Why does representative democracy improve the citizens? Because after all critics will say if representative democracy isn't the best practical realization of democracy but simply a sham, after all remember Russo's comments on England, the people of England think they're free but they're mistaken, they're free once every five years when they elect their rulers. Now  Russo then representative democracy isn't a refinement of democracy to make it appropriate for the modern world, but a way of giving away all the merits of democracy. Now Mill accepts that representative democracy can be as bad as Russo supposes it is, but there are aspects of Mill's views which make him sound very much like Russo as well. For Mill it's very important that citizens are educated for their role  and although participation on a na national level has to be something that can be restricted only to the few, Mill nevertheless wants active participation of the citizens in other aspects. So for example he's  Mill is very keen on the idea of local participation, that everyone should at some point in their lives play a role in local government in some level. Also he speaks very much in favour of jury service that he thinks that everyone is liable to jury service has a number of advantages. One is that it makes people  er  it gives people experience of participation which is itself an improving  matter. It makes people consider issues from an impartial moral point of view. Also it helps one in practice for voting. So jury service he thinks is a terrific way of improving the jurors. He doesn't defend it as the best way of getting the correct decision, he doesn't defend it, or he doesn't solely defend it that way he doesn't defend it either on the idea that people have right to be tried by their peers for example which is the most likely defence now, but he defends jury service on the grounds of the effect it has on the jurors which is quite a novel erm . In fact there's been some discussion of this lately, John Elston has argued that if jurors knew that that's why they were chosen to go on the jury, it would destabilize the princi the practice of it because if you knew you were going on jury just for self-education rather than to get the right results out the other end, then this wouldn't give you any way of motivating yourself properly for the jury. Well, I'm not sure that's correct, but anyway Mill thinks that these ideas local participation of jury service are ways of getting people involved at the highest practical level of participation. So in other words, Mill accepts the arguments of Russo the arguments of the participatory er theorists that participation in government, participation in public affairs is a good thing, people should be encouraged to participate and it has an improving effect. The worry is, is if we allow participation above a certain level, this will lead to gross inefficiencies in a governmental process. So there's a maximum level of participation \\nsocieties like ours. He thinks this is an  question but in small societies may be a much higher level of democratic erm intervention at all levels would be possible, but it's only in modern societies that participation on a very extensive scale becomes absolutely impossible. Okay so this is a rough sketch of the basic outlines, now let's try and fill in a bit more details. One question that we raised a number of times is\\nwhen people vote in this democracy, what should they be doing? Should they be voting in their own interests, or should be they be voting  out of their view of what is right, what is the good? It's normally thought that within the utilitarian tradition people should be required to vote on their interests. Because after all the right decision is to find in terms of general happiness and so you would have thought that voting was the best way of finding out where their general happiness lies. So there'd be something rather odd about people voting out of moral motivation for a utilitarian because they would be voting their estimate of where the general happiness lies, rather than putting their input into the sum from which someone else can calculate where the general happiness lies. So it's normally thought that within the utilitarian tradition, voters are required to vote their interests and then the democratic procedure tells us where the general happiness lies roughly speaking. But Mill doesn't argue this way, Mill argues that erm allowing people to vote their interests is  corrupting of them. If people are voting in their interests, why not then sell their votes to the highest bidder? They have no obligation to use it responsibly if their, if they can use their vote selfishly. Rather he thinks that people ought to vote on the basis of what they think is right  so he uses an  with the jury service at this point. He thinks that justice jurors should put their personal interest to one side. So should voters, it would be rather absurd I think, well Mill thinks, that if jurors were expected to come to a decision on the basis of what they would prefer, would you prefer this person to be sent down or would you prefer them to get off. That's not the question, the question is is it right for this person to be found guilty, is it right for this person to be found innocent? Mill thinks that  voting is to be ideally modelled on this er jury service idea so that's another reason why jury service is so important for all citizens. All citizens need a highly concentrated er episode in their lives where all they do is think about what is right in the circumstances and this will give them good practice, good training to being an enlightened voter. Again I'll come back to this point about motivation because it's very important later on. So erm this is Mill's counter-motivation. He also realizes that there are certain threats or problems with democracy. Some of these we've considered before but I'll tell you how Mill feels on them. One of them, this is not the first in the  but one of them is that democracy may well throw up unworthy rulers. This is the point erm, well Plato made the point that the people we most want to rule us are probably the ones that are the least likely to want to take on that duty and Ben Williams made the same point the other way round that the people who rise to the top in politics are likely to be the ones that we would least like to have governing us. So I think I made this point before that the people who are right at the top of politics are the ones who are very good at flattery, duplicity, manipulation and so on and these, are these really the qualities we want in our government? So, Mill thinks we need erm \\nThanks. Mill thinks we need certain safeguards to make sure that unworthy rulers don't present themselves. One thing he says which is  erm a current topic  is that we should limit the election expenses of any candidate. His thought is that how can we trust anyone who's prepared to pay their own money to get elected? If someone is going to put off a lot of their own money in order to get into parliament, we can, then we can hardly trust them to look to the general interests once they're there, they'll want a return on their investment of some sorts. So anyone who's putting up a lot of their own money is untrustworthy and there should be limitation on how much people can stand, erm Mill actually goes into some figures at this point and rather quaintly says erm either fifty pounds or a hundred pounds ought to be adequate and I don't know what that translates to now. Erm, so there should be a limitation of election expenses. In fact  makes the claim that election expenses ought to be met from the public purse rather than the private purse of the candidates\\ntax revenues and I should think Mill would be happy with that idea. Although erm his second idea second way of limiting the possibilities on  is rather more difficult to accept now  and his claim is that we shouldn't pay members of parliament, that people who go to parliament ought to be doing it out of duty and not out of er  interest. What he says is that erm  you know when he was writing of six hundred and fifty eight seats in parliament, I don't know how many there are now, but he says if we allowed for people to be paid, then we have as it were six hundred and fifty eight prizes to people's  six hundred and fifty eight jobs for people and he says and this is rather astonishing to hear, to read this is that it will attract adventurism of low class to er parliament if we pay members of parliament. Well what about those people who are morally worthy, I take it when he says low class, he doesn't mean low moral class, but mean low social class as well he probably means both things actually. What about those people of a low social class who are of a high moral class, what about them? Well he gives the example of a contemporary member of parliament, Mister Andrew Marvel who apparently was erm, because members of parliament were not paid at this time, he was sponsored by his constituents, so they subscribed to a  he was so good they managed to subscribe to  and he thinks that this is the ideal solution, if someone is really worthwhile, then their constituents would be happy to pay their salary directly, rather than, than have salaried jobs. Okay so this strikes us as a rather eccentric claim er he does qualify it, he says that there may be cases where there aren't enough people of independent means in a country to present themselves, he doesn't mean England here he means some of the dependent territories and then members of parliament should be paid compensation rather than a salary. So in other words they should be paid the salaries they would have been got getting in whatever their other line of work would have been, rather than special rates of the job of an M P.\\nI mean it may well be that we have in this country we have erm pretty much Mill's system because MPs get paid relatively little bearing in mind what most of them could be getting elsewhere, so maybe we've got something like Mill's system but it strikes us as rather a bizarre suggestion that MPs shouldn't be paid to prevent adventurous and lower classes becoming MPs. Okay so we have safeguards against unworthy rulers, much more important though Mill is worried about people voting on the wrong motives. So I've said before that erm  Mill wants people to vote just in the same way that people cast their votes in a jury on the basis of what's right. He realizes that they can't, people can't be guaranteed to do this and he points out there are four different motivations that people might have that conflict with the er moral motivations. First of all there's personal interest, secondly there's class interest  thirdly there's rather amusingly some mean feeling in his own mind, so he has the idea that people might just be rather grumpy or something when they're going to cast their, their vote and go to some rather destructive policy. I suppose you might think in a case now you might think that er  er certain people aren't entitled to welfare benefits or something that \\nand vote for the parties that excludes them, but that mean the sort of thing he  he doesn't make much of that. Fourthly erm there's the problem of coercion that is some people might be forced to cast their vote one way or another or feel they're forced to cast a vote one way or another  erm which is something we are less erm familiar with. The reason why we're less familiar with that is that we have a secret ballot and so there is no way of knowing how someone has cast their vote, and so there's no way of effectively forcing someone to cast their vote one way or another. However, Mill was against a secret ballot, Mill thought votes ought to be cast publicly and the reason for this is that he thought people ought to be voting on their view of what is right and so therefore they ought to be publicly accountable. People are much less likely to vote in their own interests, much less likely to vote in their class interests if other people know how they're voting. Mill also thinks this is a very good way of introducing female suffrage at this point which he is very much in favour of, if you had a, if you had a vote on it should if you vote if er there was a  vote among the male electors about whether women should be given the vote and there was a public ballot, then it's very unlikely they would vote against the extension of franchise because their wives and daughters would be able to see what they've done, so he thinks that erm the only reason for having a secret ballot is that you're rather ashamed of what you're doing and that if you have a public ballot people will vote much more responsibly. Now Mill realizes that the objection to this is the last problem coercion, that if people's votes are known, then some people might be able to put pressure on others to vote one way rather than another and as I said why the secret ballot was brought in in the first place. For Mill's view is that coercion is now less of a worry than people voting on their class interest or their personal interest. Er here erm you can form your own views about whether Mill's right or wrong, I mean that the situation of a secret ballot was brought in to erm overcome as one where the local industrist industrialist who employed half the member of the town was also standing for parliament. Now erm in this case would your job be safe if your vote was known and you didn't vote for your boss? I mean it seems to me in those cases a secret ballot is highly desirable and coercion would be more of a danger than people voting er from the mo wrong moral motivation. But it might just be that we can't have both and we can't ensure that people vote from the right from moral motivation rather than personal interest and we can't ensure  vote \\non coercion\\nerm  at the same time so perhaps other remedies are necessary. Now the other remedies  have is one which is rather distinct of Mill \\nthat he thinks that erm  of all of these forced motivations class interest is the most damaging  and  he argues there's a remedy for this, we'll see why it's a remedy in a minute, that certain people ought to be given more than one vote  so that although everyone should have some votes, not everyone should have the same number of votes. In particular he thinks the educated should have at least two votes, he doesn't say how many erm that's a matter determined case-by-case I take it, erm erratically it could be a thousand votes I mean he doesn't rule that out, he doesn't say it has to be more than one er  two, but erm his view is that the educated to a specially privileged in a specially privileged position because they are erm more able to use their vote sensibly or to be given more than one vote, so we need now there's going to be a question erm how do you know who the educated people are to make such suggestions, anyone with a university degree will be pleased to hear gets more than one vote on Mill's system. Anyone who enters the liberal profession so accountancy, medical and so on erm he made some other suggestions which we'll look at shortly. But there is something of a tension in Mill's view, because he thinks that erm  it's very important that if there is plural voting then the people who only have one vote should be prepared to accept the situation, so that the reasons why these people are given extra votes should be reasoned that the public, the uneducated accept  past critics have pointed out if that's going to be the case, why is it necessary to give these people extra votes, give the educated actual votes, because if the uneducated accept that the decisions of the educated are worth more than their own decisions, the opinions of the educated are worth more than the opinions of the uneducated, if they really do accept that, what's to stop them just following the decisions of the educated in their own vote? Why not simply take advice? So there's no reason why these people should be given more votes rather their superior status can be  recognized by giving them more informal influence. I was actually astonished to find Mill making exactly this argument against another proposal in erm a later chapter because he considers a possibility and some people have put forward the view apparently, I haven't heard of this, erm in the version that Mill discusses, that the two stage  action where we vote for people who then go to vote for the members of parliament so the individual people don't vote directly for members of parliament but they vote for  people who then have elections an election among themselves. This is rather like the American system of presidential elections except that in the American system, the people who are voted for are tied to a particular candidate, so it's really just erm a convoluted way of having a direct system rather than a genuinely indirect system here. But Mill considers what, what reasons could there possibly be for having this two stage process. The arguments given in favour is that we vote for the wise and then the wise go on to make a proper final decision about who's best. Mill says exactly what I just said in response of him that is if the people are prepared to accept these  why  what's to stop them consulting and asking for advice about how they should cast their vote and so Mill later on gives a response to his own suggestion about plural voting in effect without realizing that what he's done. Anyway that's not important, the important thing is that he makes this, this idea that the educated should be erm given plural votes, in order to protect democracy being distorted by class interest. Now the most important threat to democracy and the way in which class interest may establish itself is Mill thinks through stupidity and this is the most er challenging threat to democracy. The, the, the numerical majority he says may just not have the intelligence to make the right decisions and what he's particularly concerned about is that the uneducated poor who he calls the numerical majority will vote to equalize property. Now his  argument against this is not that  actual right to property, but it's actually against the interests of the uneducated poor to equalize property  \\nif property is equalized then the economy will  so he uses some sort of incentive argument here and maybe some sort of  undertones here that inequalities are necessary to make the worse off better off than they would have been without them, but he thinks the uneducated poor may well be too stupid\\nto understand this so they may go to their immediate selfish interest rather than their long-term interest. There's a further point that the effects of the policy may not strike in the  first generation anyway, it may be long-term before er equalization of property has the  effect and other things  so these people might, might vote in their own class interest against the interest of future generations. Now Mill seems to be very unsure what to do about this because he doesn't want to say that the poor should be disenfranchised, because after all everyone is entitled to their say in government, but he does seem to be worried that if the poor are given an equal say or the uned uneducated poor are given an equal say, then they will make a very bad decision, a decision which is against their own interests  and this is one reason why he favours plural voting because he recognizes that the numerical majority might make a  erm wrong decision, so we should make sure that the numerical majority don't have sway in a democratic process by giving another client more weight in it  so he seems to  between wanting to disenfranchise them altogether which he seems to consider and just emasculating their vote by giving other people more votes. In fact one thing he says er which might make you doubt his motives somewhat is that the reason for giving people more than one vote is that they're more educated, but in general there is also a rough correlation between property ownership and education and so there's a good reason  to give the property owners more than one vote, people who own a lot of property more than one vote. Now he says that someone who doesn't hold much property can prove that they're educated they should get the extra votes too, but you don't seem, you don't have to prove that you're er educated if you're rich you just get the votes anyway because that's a good . Now actually Mill did put the his erm  this proposal forward, he was a member of parliament for a few years and he was trying to get this discussed in parliament. No one seemed very interested in it. Well what this springs up is the issue, one of the issues we started with which is democracy in the tyranny of the majority is what Mill recognizes is is that a maj well  he claims to be concerned that the majority will make a decision which is against the interests of everyone, but he's equally concerned about the issue that the majority might make a decision which is against the interests just of a picked-on minority, people with unpopular views, people who hold er members of a different religion and so on. So erm  Mill wants to protect minority from within the democratic procedure, that is he wants to set up erm a system of democracy which is as it were proof against majority corruption. One way in which he does that he thinks is by plural voting, that you give the educated more than one vote, he says we have to make sure the educated don't form their own class with their own class interests, but, but giving the educated a bigger say will lead us to make better decisions he thinks. But he also endorses a very elaborate system of proportional representation with a single-transferable vote erm this is in the chapter called  voting erm it seems to me actually his system is incoherent, but he doesn't think that, I mean he argues very strongly in favour of it and various  it. His idea is that you can vote if if the voter in your constit if a person you vote for in your own constituency loses, you can then switch your vote to anyone else in the country and erm you can have a list of maybe ten or twenty people and erm you will  so you'll hand in your ballot paper with all these names on, signed ballot paper because it has to be public you can hand in your signed ballot paper with all these names on and if your own candidate loses, then er your vote goes to your second person and if that person loses it goes to the third and so on. The incoherence I think is that you can't ever say that anyone has lost because you don't know what's happening in the second and third and fourth erm batch, so I can't see how this system is meant to work, Mill seems to be fairly confident that it will. So he has an interesting idea that we can set up democratic procedures to protect the minority within those procedures so that tyranny of the majority is something that afflicts only certain types of democracies, but if we have other types of democracies then we can protect the minority  and the idea for proportional representation is often claimed in this light, but actually it doesn't work as an idea, because although it allows a minority to be represented,represented is a different  from being protected and so even if there's a member of parliament with the  one member of parliament with your unpopular views, that doesn't mean that your unpopular views won't be made illegal say, because the fact that there's one member of parliament won't mean that  \\nso his procedure doesn't work. There are other ways people have tried to protect the minority, one is by saying that the, that you can generate a certain set of rights from within the democratic procedure in a different way, that is if democracies flourish people need certain liberties, people need to express their own opinions, people need to be able to do what erm assemble where they need to and so on but more common is the view that democracy should be limited by constitutional  would present the minority and this is a view that Mill doesn't really defend in representative government although it seems to be very close to his view and on liberty, that is we limit the spear that this government has control over so we can't, so in this view erm democracy is given a very limited role. It's very interesting to note that in contemporary political philosophy there is almost no room left for democratic decision making because in most theories that we're given, more or less everything is already decided at a constitutional level I mean think of  theory of justice, it's the theory of justice that decides the basic nature of a constitution so the role of members of a government is simply to interpret and apply the constitution so they can make the most efficient tax policies given the basic constitution, but no individual has the authority to  challenge that constitution and change it by democratic means. To  it's even worse I mean there, there doesn't even seem to be a government in the  there's just a police force and an army and no one making political decisions, so it's a peculiarity of recent political philosophy there seems to be no room left for the democratic process to do much apart from administer, so the democracy is given a very minor role. Okay so I think that erm  some of Mill's system he has given us  and accounted them a type of theory of democracy but seems to me deeply  by  between two ideas, one is that everyone will have a say in government and the other is they shouldn't be allowed decisive say if they are going to say the wrong thing so that on the one hand we have democratic equality of a source, on the other hand we have an independent theory of the good and a democratic process should be allowed to disrupt the good of the nation  and Mill just doesn't seem to be able to  put these two elements in erm proper coherent fashion. So what should we conclude about our own system on the  well we do have a representative democracy here, it's very unlike Mill's recommended scheme. We have no idea what people are meant are meant to be doing when they're voting, this was a problem I raised  are people meant to be expressing their interest, are people meant to be voting like members of a jury? We're not told and it doesn't say on your ballot paper please be sure to remember you're voting on what you think is right rather than what is in your personal interest, you were just asked to vote. So how can we defend the system that we've got? Well, it seems that  none of the arguments that have been used so far would come close to defending the type of system that we've got. Now critics of contemporary systems say so much for the worse for contemporary system, we have to move to one of the other models, maybe  suitably amended and only then will we be truly free and equal. The best I think we can say about our scheme is something that Brian Barry argues. It's in a paper I didn't put on the reading list because most of it is not relevant, it's called Is Democracy Special? and this in his collective papers. What Barry says is simply this that suppose we accept the point that authority structures are now necessary, that we couldn't have anarchy we have to have  \\npeople in control. Well in a modern world we've lost the faith that certain people are appointed by God to do this for us, or especially naturally fitted to do it, so how are we going to accept the rule of some people rather than others? Well he thinks the only way that modern will accept the rule of one person rather than another is if they think they're somehow there as a result of  their own action, so we'll only accept the rule of erm  our leaders if we think we put them there and we take them back again, we put them there and can recall them and this for Barry is the only merit that contemporary democratic  policy  democratic erm systems that it allows us to think of our rulers as having some legitimate claim to rule. Without democracy we wouldn't be able to say  who should rule, with democracy we can we can say these people because we voted for them and that's it, we can't say these people  interests we can't say that these people act in  common good although if they do very badly we'll try and recall them, all we can say is they're there we need, what we need is authority structures, we need the structures more than the people occupying the roles, someone's got to occupy the roles and this is the only way we've got of appointing them. So on that very depressing note, er I'll leave we've got a few minutes for  questions or objections if anyone wants to, we've got some head shaking.\",\n",

Er, Great North House, Northern Development Company. O K Marion, would you care to kick off? Yes, O K, erm, I brought what I thought would be a help from last week. Did  your report back?we didn't have a meeting the first week, did we? Marion? and I wasn't in the last week so I doubt whether\\nDo you want one on last week?,\\nIt's all there I assume,\\nO K, right, O K, yes \\nErm, the quarterly report went out towards the end of that first week, erm, with the annual finance statements, erm, we're ple , quite encouraging because of the erm, S and E enquiries, were actually done on his proportion for once. Only just, but, because er, a hundred and eleven, if the enquiry's a hundred and six or  constitutions, which is quite good, and obviously December was really quiet but then that's standard anyway, because , quite possibly not because it was sort of erm, he's shown with an  which didn't \\nSo it's something folded back on one side yes,? I mean it's not that vital to me, but I hadn't\\nYes\\nYes. , but I'm not surprised, so, erm, in our previous visit they did give us\\nThen  was down in Middlesbrough for a couple of days that week, and er, I think amused everybody by calling it miserable all the time, I dread to think what . I told you how he was on the phone that day, I mean, he hadn't the foggiest idea of what, what he was doing or where he was going, I don't know. I think he got on er, quite well down there, because he'd spent a few days up here he had a better idea of what he wanted to ask, and what he wanted to talk about and so on, but erm, only because his deadline's  and  \\ndo you want to ring? Ah, right, I don't, I think it's now been called regional Christmas Day  \\nMakes a lot more sense, O K \\nAt Mercury, he clocked the sponsorship erm, late last year. Right, I must get some literature actually from Barry because as you know, it, it, we can't get it all out of the  now,\\nRight, oh and Phil went to the Stoke  conference on that Thursday and Friday. He got bored silly and considered it a complete waste of time. Which I did try to tell   \\nErm, I seem to remember that's the day that East Anglia kind of just disappeared in \\nMm, yes, yes. That's right,\\nI was supposed to have a meeting on with erm, a couple of guys from the British Coal Enterprise down in Middlesbrough with , but unfortunately again the weather caught all of them out and they decided not to come, but didn't occur to them to say they wouldn't come, so I sat down there for an hour, and eventually managed to find a phone number and get in contact and the guy was still there, and he said oh no I'm not coming up. This was like quarter to twelve, he should have been there at eleven o'clock. No  he got stuck in London the night before because of the bad weather, and he started saying oh I'm sorry I don't think I'm going to be able to make it. Well I said, I was a bit concerned, I said it would be nice if you could let us know and\\nEspecially since you travel er, er, twenty or thirty to get there. Yes, that's right, yes, I mean until you get there. I mean he knew that because he'd contacted me up here and I said well, to make it easier for you we could meet in Middlesbrough, save you coming up from er, Mansfield. I said well, it cuts the, it cuts the journey in half then. I wasn't too happy about that but never mind. Erm, what else, last week I had a meeting with Mike  and Yvonne from D T I and Phil. I was looking forward to talk a bit about er, what they're doing er, in the way of seminars and so on this year and how we can tie in with it, and how we're going to erm, actually take over the forum plan for Eurofile. It's typical, they just accepted it all, so it didn't really achieve a great deal, but Mike told me quite a lot of things that I don't really have any idea, or I didn't know about,\\nWhat achievement of financial business will  four year plan, will it make anything else? I can't see that they can afford to be a high profile company? They're going to erm, they're going to give the money towards running a forum, but not a great deal, and then it doesn't even cost that much, it just really a question of erm, mailshots  and twice yearly events or whatever. You don't think it'll be  once they put the money \\nYes, so it's, you know, it's like two mailshots up once a quarter or whatever,minutes, and I'm paying for a lunch. you're thinking of direct costs, but erm, Phil was going to ask Jeff  if he would chair it, and also if he'd be willing, to be sort of editor in chief, of Eurofile, so that was yesterday, and I haven't seen Phil since, don't know what happened with that and went to him that it was a briefing meeting. yes\\nThis  individual just about won, in fact it was over by ten past two. Yes, Oh I, yes, I can see here, yes, that's only two\\nIt's more than I saw of him. Mhm,\\nWhy I'm not sure\\nWalkies \\nBut erm, yes, so I still don't know what's happening with that yet, and I'm waiting also for them to confirm a date for this first sort of Do Business in France seminar, that we're going to help them with, which was originally going to be February, and is now going to be March. We think it was going to be the seventh and the eighth and the ninth, and they've told Newcastle City it's the ninth, but she was meant to confirmed last Wednesday, and she's still not. So erm, I've had a word \\nAre export involved in this, I mean it seems quite  if they're not? Mm, yes, but the trouble is they're not going to be interested in Europe, so they're not, Western Europe . They don't know how useful it would be but anyway, they said there, there's, it's a slightly odd event because it's actually going to be just in the Civic Centre, and er, and  kind of tacking on some workshops and things, so I'm going to help her with workshops and have a display stand and so on but other than that, we've not really got any direct input into it, because it is very much, sort of, you know, this is how you do business in France, these are the financial problems, type of thing. It's just a good workshop,yes\\nWhich I was for shying off anyway, because I don't think it's any of our, our business. I'm mean they've got export people that know about that, and E C people one of those things. Yes, that's right, so I said you know, it's on a general level, I said yes, fine. But, er, other people start bringing up sort of problems with the French tax situation on such and such a structure of company or whatever, which is not anything we want to get involved with. So I had a meeting with Dailey to talk about the workshops and so on, so we've bashed out the format and er, and what we think we'd like to do, but it's partly dependent on D T I, because it is their event, and we want to be seen to hijack it. Erm, I had a meeting with Ian and erm,Do , Dorothy. Mhm, and told them that you wouldn't be  your present arrangement\\nErm, yes, quite\\nThey took it remarkably well really, but er, I think there needs to be soft  There must be  have contingency, because Anne'd go up the wall  over that. You know, I don't know it was sort of well, have a little bit of a boss at Bill then, as a restraining influence\\nin the past \\nI'm no help either, I did sort of wonder what she'd say but she's. They've been sort of so falsely jolly in the past, it sickens me. Get into Microfit, when you're in the data input menu  I'd like you to call up the file Q M four FIT \\nQ M four FIT  file  file . If you just look at the er  the sheet, that we've handed out, they  loaded from er from the computer it's that data that's in front of you, right, we've got three, three series, right, it's times  data, right, from nineteen twenty three to nineteen forty five, right and the three variables are, textile consumption,United States er real, sorry  is benevolence of the U S, so it's textile consumption,capita, real income er per capita income to be adjusted through inflation, so  constant money terms and what the relative price of textiles P erm the price of textiles relative to the general level er the general price level. Okay what we're going to be doing is estimating a demand function   so we can specify the textile consumption as a function of real incomes per capita and also relative prices, alright. A priori, what sign would we expect on those two variables? Say the income, what sign would you expect to observe? Yeah positive providing textiles are a normal good, you should observe positive er income consumption response okay. How about prices?what code, what sign do we expect on the er the price variable there? Yeah negative, right, textiles rise faster, the price of textiles rises faster than the general price level, the real increase in textile prices, therefore, we'd expect  providing the first law of demand holds, that we get a negative response consumption, right. So that's what we expect a priori a positive coefficient, a negative, coefficient, positive on income, negative on prices. What we are actually going to do today is to look  using this data, is to look at structural stability, right, we're going to ask ourselves are the parameters that we estimate over the entire sample, are they constant over time. There's no point in estimating a model  if in reality those coefficients are not fixed, they're jumping all over the place. Right with those parameters, so if you just look at the er coefficional income, if we estimate the coefficional income to be nought point five right, over the entire sample, the then subsequently find out if that coefficient varies from year to year from minus six plus ten, right, having a one point estimate, right, er oh that coefficient is not going to be particularly useful to us, we want to know er whether our coefficients remain reasonably constant throughout our sample period, particularly if we're using this er equation to make out of sample predictions, right. The first thing we must er be sure of is that the coefficients within the sample are reasonably, er reasonably constant, right. If they are not reasonably constant, then not only is the model er a poor one, right, within sample but it can't really be used for out of sample predictions, because although on average er our coefficient that we estimate it might be nought point five, then the out of sample could well be minus six or something like that. Right, so you need to know that our model is characterized by constant parameters over the sample. Now the data that we've got here has been artificially generated. the last six observations of it has, right, the first six observations, sorry the er the first twenty odd observations are real, right, that they haven't been made up but the last six observations have been made up, right, to er to illustrate structural change. We will assume that we don't know that there is structural change in this data, although a priori, we might expect it. Why, why might we expect structural change to occur in this example? Anything in particular? Okay, yeah, that's right, this s this series a particularly volatile period of economic history in the nineteen thirties, the Great Depression, in addition what's at the end of the series? Yeah the Second World War, right, so er I can tell you now that in actual fact there's no structural change during the thirties here but there is structural change during the war. Textile consumption, or the parameters that we estimate during peacetime no longer er explain textile consumption during wartime. Right, I'm going to go through methods of how we can detect structural change by the non constant parameters. The first thing we'll do is look at the data, alright, so if you go from the action menu into option one, right, we're going to plot er go through to the transform edit\\noption, go into the data processing environment, right, where your three variables are listed T C I P.\\nRight, if you just give the command Plot T C Plot space T C then press the return key\\nright, that's textile consumption over our sample. Now it's not immediately obvious from that time series that there's a structural break, right, textile consumption hasn't fallen dramatically, right, or risen dramatically over the post war period, oh sorry du during the er the war period. Nevertheless we can show that there is significant structural change er in the model that we'll\\nestimate. Right, so by looking at the graph, I am just trying to impress upon you that structural change cannot always be spotted simply by looking at the data  right, anyway, let's now  move on to estimate our first model. What we are going to be doing is trying to explain that series, right that er consumption series. So if you press the escape key we'll go back to the data processing environment, right. What we're going to do is to log all our variables, right, so if you let L N T C equal  open brackets T C close brackets, right, we going to define a new variable L N T C.\\nThat's going to be the natural logarithm, right, of our original series T C textile consumption. If you now plot L N T C  right, if you plot L N T C  you should have a very similar graph to the one that you had before. Alright, logging the data doesn't change the nature of the data, what it does do is that it re-scales the data, okay so the only thing that's, that's, that's changed by logging, right, is the scale of the cr is the vertical scale on the graph, right, but essentially we are still trying to model the same series and N T C is essentially the same series as T C.\\nOkay, so if you press the escape key, once you've had a look at the data, er if you log all the other variables er if you let L N I equal log open brackets I close brackets  let L N P equal log open brackets P close brackets, press the return key. Okay has everyone created those three variables in logs? Okay, right what we are going to er do now is create a constant, we'll need a constant for our regressions  so if you type the letter Q to come out of the data processing environment  right type the letter Q right and then go into the er constant creation menu, which is option one of the data processing menu  right,you'll, you'll be asked for a name for  if you like call it C or constant or Fred Bloggs, just supply a name  to your constant term. By the way has everybody changed erm the password or their password, have you changed it to your date of birth, have you all done that because if you haven't, you've only got six grace log-ins on erm where your password is your user name. If you don't change\\nyour password within six er times of logging in then you will be excluded from the network. So you won't be able to log on to Microfit? Right,okay, so has everybody created a constant  right, what we are going to do now is to er estimate the first model right equation one on the sheets that you've been given, alright, you've created a constant, we've got our variables L N T C L N I L N P \\nright so if press the letter Q to quit from the data processing environment and press the return key, head towards the action menu, right, when you are in the action menu, go to option two, which is the estimate option, right, and you should then be given a dialog box. If you then specify your equation, so it's L N T C your dependent variable space, whatever the name you called your constant then L N I space L N P.\\nNow just specify the variables that you want in this regression, right, your dependent variable first  okay when you've specified the equation, sorry   once you specify the equation press the end key which is between the alphabetic and the numeric key pads, that will then submit that request, right. If you then er, it will then ask you over what period do you want to  right so if you press the end key that will submit the job erm it asks for the sample period, we're going to use the whole of the sample, so if you just press the return key, that's the default for the whole of the sample, right, it then asks you what procedure you want to use to estimate the model, we're going to use O L S  option one, just press the return key O L S then  the computer has estimated the model, right. Before we move on, let's just have a look at those numerical estimates, can we look at the coefficients on income, notice that in this model because we've logged both dependent and the independent variables, right, the coefficients that we estimate are elasticities, right, so we can read those coefficients off directly as elasticities and that's the case for any model in which all the variables are logged  right, in er, if we didn't log the data, in order to calculate the elasticity we have to multiply a coefficient the computer gives us by a erm price quantity ratio, price less, less  part of the income constant ratio to obtain the income elasticities. Alright but in any double logged mode, right, the coefficients you estimate are elasticities, so we look at the incoming elasticity, we get a measure, or we get an estimate point six eight, right, that's a positive as we would expect suggesting that er erm textiles are a normal good, right. Notice that an incoming elasticity is less than unity, and that's less than one, as a result  textiles, textile industry in the Netherlands is going to be a declining sector in the economy, right, as incomes  er per capita G D P rises, the textile sector will benefit, alright, because, because human demand for textiles either they're demanding proportionately less of any increases in incomes. Right, then so as a result the textiles would be a  and relative decline to the rest of the economy. Is that  a T ratio on that incoming elasticity? Is that coefficient statistically significant, is it significantly different from zero? Our estimate  incoming elasticity, just  the T ratio  would you say. T ratio of one point four nine. Typically we use the rule of thumb to  statistical significance so if we have a T ratio that's less than two\\nwe can infer that that coefficient to which the T ratio is attached is not significantly zero. In actual fact our incoming elasticity there with er nought point six is statistically significant zero, eighty five percent confidence level. Confidence  right the figure in the square brackets next to the T ratio gives you the significance level of the coefficient, right. We normally use the five percent significance level or the ten percent significance level which corresponds er ninety five percent confidence or ninety percent confidence  right. So this T ratio on income elasticity is for the bit  right and if we were using the five percent or ten percent as our sort of cut off point, we'd actually discard income from our consumption, from our demand function. Now as economists we should have strong prides about income in this model, we would all, we would expect income to be very important in explaining textile consumption although the model is telling us at the moment, income doesn't seem to be significantly explained in textile consumption so that's something to worry about, we're getting some, er sort of peculiar results here. We now look at the er  price  unity as a T ratio minus ten, right, so it's highly significant, right and the er figure in square brackets, the probability value next to the T ratio tells you that we get  least ninety nine point nine percent confidence  coefficiency  price elasticity demand  significantly different from zero  right, now is everybody happy interpreting the coefficient right and the T ratio? If not say now and we can go through it. It is vitally important that you know \\nhow to distinguish a statistically significant coefficient, right, rule of thumb is that the T ratio has to be greater than two with absolute value  right and the figures in square brackets next to the T ratios tell us the exact level of significance, right, er of that coefficient, right, so the incoming elasticity of demand is statistically significant from zero only at the eighty five percent level, a correspondence of fifteen percent significance that  incoming  the price elasticity demand, highly significant, right, significance level as given by the probabil by the probability er unit in square brackets, the timing level  therefore we could be very highly confident about that  coefficient okay. So we've got this model, right, we've estimated the model, let's now have a look at the plot of actual and predicted. So if you press the return key  right, we just get a whole list of diagnostic test statistics that we won't look at at the moment, press the return key again, come to the post regression menu, you go into option three which is a list plot option. Now the plot actual and fitted, right, so we try to explain the actual block of textile consumption as the blue line and to do that we are using our model with those fixed estimates, the incoming elasticity and the price elasticity. As you can see there, the model is breaking down during the latter period of our sample. The notice that appears to track the data quite well up until about nineteen thirty, right and then after nineteen thirty it seems to get progressively worse. Now we may suggest that that's the effect of the Second World War biasing alright biasing the estimates that we've just produced from the whole sample. Now because   I'll leave that for a moment  right, so one way we may test the structural change, right, is to construct what's called a dummy variable and a dummy variables in a wide variety of applications  they can be used to er get rid of er outlying observations, very very high or very very low observations. They can also be used for tests for structural change, right, what we're going to do is to say during peacetime  right, we'll estimate our model, we'll then estimate our model during wartime and we're going to assume that the coefficients or the income and price elasticity  mark, don't change during between peace and wartime, all that happens is as they intercept this model shifts, right, now you may thinks that's not particularly er attractive, you might expect the price of income elasticities to change between two periods and we could actually use dummy variables to see whether that is the case, right, however, we'll get very similar results, right, if you just use a slope dummy so it'd intercept dummy, right, and all that's going to do is to say, well the model runs like this in peacetime, right, and then wartime it suddenly shifts up or down depending on the effect of er of the war on textile consumption. Right, so what we're going to do is create a dummy variable to test that hypothesis, right, so if you press the escape key, right, and work your way back towards erm the data processing sort of environment, so go back to the post regression menu through the backtracking menu erm, when you're in the backtracking menu, go to option six, which is the process plot edit option  right, now press the return key in the data processing menu, right, and that will get you to the data processing environment when we can start messing about with our variables. Right, what we are going to do now is create a dummy variable, right, let's call it D one right so if you type D one equals zero and press the return key  what you created there, right, is a new variable called D one and it assumes the value of zero, right, what I want you to do now is to edit this variable, so type edit space D one press the return key  right, if you type on edit space D one you'll then get a sheet that has all the observations for our variable D one. Using the cursor key move down to nineteen, the observation for nineteen forty  right when you've done that type the letter one  and then press the return key, right, and you'll see that the observation is changed, right, from zero to one. Move the cursor to nineteen forty one, right, and then press one again, press return key. Just go through the remainder  of the, of the observations, so that you should have zeros up until nineteen forty and then at nineteen forty through to nineteen forty five, right, you have ones. When you've finished doing that, press the end key. Right the end key will save the edit that you've just made  okay. Right, what we're now going to do is incorporate that dummy variable as the regressor in our model as an explanatory variable, so what's going to happen is that that dummy variable is turned off, alright in the first part of the sample right up until the war that dummy variable's going to be off, right so it has a value of zero, right, then in nineteen forty through to nineteen forty five it's switched on and what it's going to do is to pick up any differential effects, right, in the intercept between wartime and peacetime  right, we'll talk a little bit more, more about that in a second, we're going to add it in as a regressor, right, because it only comes on during the wartime it will pick up any shift in the intercept, right, that occurs due to the war if there is one, of course there may not be but it's quite likely that there, there may well be, so if you type Q to come out of the data processing environment, go back to the action menu and test estimate forecast  okay at the dialog box just add D one to your list of explanatory variables, alright then press the end key, right, yeah we're gonna use the full sample  right, we gonna use O L S, right you have now estimated the model with this dummy variable  now just to see what's happened to those coefficients  the er incoming elasticity was at nought point six is now doubled  right to one point one four  more importantly, right, its T ratio has jumped from one point eight five  right to six point eight, as a result, we now say that the incoming elasticity, the income coefficients, right, the significant  zero, it's important to explain the textiles as such  the er, we are now getting a very different estimate for our\\nour estimate for price elasticity is four and one to nought point eight minus one is one point eight, notice though that its  ratio has jumped  considerably or has doubled  and the dummy variable itself  is very significant  the T ratio ten  the coefficient on that dummy variable tells us the effect of the war on textile consumption, right so on average textile consumption rose by point two  er see what the units of measurement are  we don't actually have  units of er ah so we'll \\nelasticity  whatever it's multiplied by \\nThat's right if you er  so this point two quantifies the effect of the war on our equation, and where is the so the intercept, well what you're saying is in peacetime the intercept is equation three point one seven, however, in war time the intercept shifts up and is now three point one seven plus point two,\\nYou could draw it like that  you could say that this is the  the war which cuts in this time of year  line shifts up,\\nYes. so if you wanted it back, you would actually get a new value for the intercept which increases by nought point two  three point\\nThree point one  okay so this is where the model, in effect what we've done which is a very crude way, right, of erm incorporating exogamous influences, right, we haven't said tha that the war is going to affect the income or price elasticity what we did do, right, all that we're doing is that we're allowing the intercept of our model to change, right, now as a result, we've got, we can prove the st the statistical significance of all the variables in our model, right, the co the actual coefficients that we've estimated have changed  quite significant, particularly in the er the incoming elasticity, right, the incoming elasticity was less than one, right, and insignificance before was now greater than one and height of R squared has also increased dramatically our measure of explanatory power. Now if you just press the return key a couple of times  right, and have a lot of actual and fitted, if you go into option three in the data  post depression menu  you will notice that the fit of our model is very very different  right, so we are now getting a very very good correspondence between actual and fitted, notice that in our original model the thing started to break down at about nineteen thirty, right, just by allowing the intercept to vary, right, over the wartime we've now got a much better fit throughout the whole period  why is that the case? Why are we now getting a much better fit throughout the entire period simply by incorporating the dummy variable to the war period? Any suggestions? Well what's happening is it the, during the war, right, we're constraining the computer to estimate, like a single coefficient that is applicable to both war and peacetime er isn't the case, right,th there is a structural change, right, so when th when we constrain the computer to estimate the coefficients throughout the whole period, right, the coefficients are biased but if they don't apply either to the post er pre war peacetime sample neither do they er fit very well to the data during the wartime, right, if we allow the intercept to change but we're getting much better estimates both wartime and peacetime er parameter's okay because we haven't got rid of, we've got rid of that bias, right, in constraining the parameters to fit both wartime and peacetime er time periods. Okay, erm  on this sheet, I don't think, well we won't go through it now because we've run out of time. On this sheet, on page two, we've er, we've performed equation two, right, on the sheet and the second page and it says that there's, there are two alternative ways of testing for structural change using dummy variables. One is to include corporate dummy variable of the intercept and see whether it's T ratio or significantly different, is, sorry it's greater than two  right or we can use an F test, right, now that F test that's given me that formula in the middle of the page is a very important  test which was developed by a chap called Chow and as a result it become known as the Chow test and it's a, it's a test for parameter constancy, er do we have constant parameters in our model  now it tells you how to compute this Chow test, in this particular case we're only dummying the intercept, the Chow test gives exactly the same results of T tests, right, erm  we won't bother going through it, if you want to go through this er sheet in your own time calculate that, that Chow test and essentially what it involves is splitting with the s the whole sample now into two sub-samples, right, the first sub-sample, right, is peacetime, the second sub-sample wartime, right, and you just compare the residual sum of the squares on the unaccounted for variation, right, between actual and fitted values, just compare the residual sum of squares between these two sub periods, right and if you use the formula that's given there that will come out with exactly the same result, well in actual fact you can square, if you square the F statistic you get  calculating one formula you will get T value, got from er the computer  right, the er, the sheet goes on to say how we can er use dummy variables in slightly more complicated ways, right, we could see actually see whether the income or price elasticities of demand changed. Right, instead of letting the intercept change we could just let er our elasticities change. Anyway  that's preferable because that's actually what's, what's happening, right, the war is likely to affect the elasticities of demand rather than this er bizarre concept intercept erm and the, the sheet on page three tells you how, how to do that  okay. But essentially all these tests do the same thing because they're seeing whether the parameters that we estimate over the entire sample are robust over all sub-samples, right, we can't, we wouldn't bother testing over all sub-samples though we can do, it's just if we have good reason to believe that behaviour in one sub-sample  different for behaviour in another E G use er Chow test or equivalently a dummy variable on the intercept to see whether there was any change. Right, okay we'll leave it there, if you just press the escape key and then work your way out of Microfit towards the action menu, exit from Microfit and don't forget to log out of the network. Okay, feel free to come down here at any time with this sheet and er going through the, the examples in greater detail Q M four FIT was the data file, you'll always be able to access, right  when you've logged out of the network feel free to go and a merry Christmas, see you next year.\",\n",

Kimometres Kilometres. Yes and I'm gonna give you this sheet which  it's to save time for drawing it. This is where you now need to concentrate. What we've done so far is dead easy. Because it's not as simple as it looks on this sheet. What's at the centre of our universe? Not our universe our solar system sorry. Kieran. The sun. The sun. Our sun our star. Is there somebody sit there going ? Think, does it? No. No it doesn't. What does the sun do? Gives us light and . It does but that's because it's like a huge atom bomb flowing hydrogen all the time. It moves around in space, it's moving all the time. All those stars are moving. Not quickly as far as we can see. Don't get upset you're not going to disappear one night. All right concentrate. The sun is moving, it's also turning, spinning, like a ball spinning on your finger. What are the planets doing? Revolving  . They are spin not all of them. Not all of them. Now that's a little thing you might want to check if you've got an atlas at home. Some of them don't revolve don't spin in their axis. Earth does. What else are they doing, apart from those that spin? Yes. Moving. Moving. And they're moving around the sun. What do we call the path that they follow? When something's going round something else, do you know the word?\",\n",
       " \"Oh no. Try it. Solar. No that's that's to do with the sun. That's what we talked about last time yes. But if you know it. What about space craft? Space craft goes up and when it gets to a certain height above the earth it just goes round and round and round. What do we say it's doing, what what is it in? Come on star trek, when he parks his star ship what does he say? We're in? Space. Well  yes you're in space. Pardon? Well hardly ever  our watch. Orbit. Orbit. They're in orbit. Orbit means you go round and round and round and round and round. Because you're held there by all these planets and stars pulling at you. And that's what holds these planets. The sun has its own gravity. Do you remember me mentioning that? And it's trying to pull the planets in, Lee, but other stars are pulling them and stopping them falling into the sun. All different distances away from the sun and there's Jennifer's a hundred and fifty million millimetres. All going round in, what's the word again? Orbit. Orbit. In fact this a this isn't quite accurate. Because the orbit isn't round isn't a circle, it's an ellipse, it's more like that. All right? And while you've got the planet orbiting the sun there are things that orbit the plant. What d'ya call something that goes round and round a planet? Think you've all seen them. At least one regularly. When you look at night you see? Lee. Stars. But they're not ones that are orbiting the planet. Katrina. Moon. Moon. Moon orbit the planet. Here it tells you how many moons each planet's got. Earth has one you know that. Jupiter which is a huge planet, if you look carefully here this is a this is to scale, this shows you the size of the planet. So this size of Jupiter compared with earth. You see, there's Venus which is about the same size, Mercury's a small one, Saturn is huge, Uranus, Neptune they're big ones and Pluto's another one about the same size as earth. So that's not quite accurate either. This is just to give you the order and the distance. And Jupiter has twelve moons. Some of the moons of Jupiter are enormous. These are all orbiting Jupiter as Jupiter orbits the sun.\",\n",
       " \"Right. Would you give one of those out. We we won't do anything with it yet. We need now to open our books. Rule off from where you were before I want you to get some information down about our solar system. More or less what we've just talked about. Because it's still only the second week with me I think get the information down and we'll do what we did last week. Do you remember what we did last week? We did it all together. And by the way I'm very pleased to see that some of you actually wrote it completely in your own words didn't you. Either that or I can't read your writing properly. That's very good. As  you get the facts right. We finished off with giving a list of the planets haven't we? We've talked about the sun a little bit, we just have done. We started to talk about the solar system. How far have we got on the solar system Josephine? Naming the planets? Mm. We need to do a bit about the sun spinning and moving through space don't we? We've not got that down have we. So put today's date. What happened to the one that you had did you give it back in? Have you got a ruler? So can somebody give me a sentence that explains what we talked about the sun isn't staying still it's, all right Kieran. The sun's in the middle of the galaxy that \\nWell it's you can't say in the middle of the galaxy, it's only in the middle of the galaxy as we look at it. Er let's be absolutely scientific. Erm all we need to say is the sun isn't still, what can we say. Go on Louise. Is it moving? The sun moves through space yes. And while it's moving through space what is it doing, what did we say. Steven. Is erm it spins. Spins good. What shall we say spins or rotates. I think spins is best. Quick  the sun. So what did we say. Louise said you said that you said? It's moving. The sun moves through space  and Steven we decided on spins. Spins. Just to make sure that erm just to make sure that we don't think it's just spinning wherever it feels like spinning, it's spinning on its axis isn't it. D'ya know what the axis is? Erm imaginary line that goes down through the middle of a ball, yes, through there Jupiter. No apostrophe on its. No this is an apostrophe free zone for now. Next er thing we need to describe is that planets move round the sun don't we? How can we say that? Go on then. The planets all nine planets all move round \\nWell let's not say all nine planets for all we know they'll discover a new one tomorrow. Have to say the planets and don't forget we've got to think about other solar systems as well so we're not let's not limit us to to the number, the planets why not. Yes. Go on. The planets orbit around the sun. Everybody happy with the word orbit? Do you understand that? Kieran suggest we say, instead of saying the planets move round in orbit we should say the planets orbit the sun.\",\n",

We talked about the sun moving, we've got that, spins, planets orbit the sun. What else might might there be out there in space? Think about what you've seen. Jupiter's got twelve sun moons. Twelve moons. The moons that's what we need. Need something else first. Said the sun spins, do all the planets spin?\",\n",
       " \"Er no. No. Can we check that? I'm thinking of one in particular that wants checking. There's one that's very hot one side and extremely cold the other. So some of the planets spin. Is there anybody that can look into that for us for next week? Oh Jamie's not here is he? Then we've got Louise's point about moons. The moons orbit what? erm the planets. The planet. Do all the planets have moons? No. No. So that's  some planets  haven't  why not? That's a surprise Jeremy. Some planets have moons. And that's on that sheet that you've got. There are quite a lot of other bits and bobs floating about, asteroids, meteors, little bits of chunks flying all over the place. Now can we think of a famous thing that sometimes appears in space? Halley's comet. Halley's comet which is er a big lump of rock that flies around in its own orbit. It's not part of our solar system it just is it every sev how many years is it every seventy six or something? It's not that long with Halley's comet because you don't see it very very well sometimes. I think it's . I can't remember that's something else you need to check. Erm it's quite regular I know, but some years you just can't see it very well. Erm and there are loads of other ones some only come every few hundred years. And they just travel through the the galaxy on a huge orbit, yes? Is the thing what happens in America where ? Mud? Like something to do with mud like comes from America. What to do with space? Yes. You're not thinking of er like er a meteorite are you ? Yeah. A meteor yes, yes I know what he means now. A meteor is is something rock floating through space. When it comes into our atmosphere it's called a meteorite and most of them burn off as they come through the atmosphere. Some of them  and yet you get huge damage.

Glue your pages together then. Erm if you wanted to get time to look at the chart to colour the planets the right colour that's up to you. Day and night. What do you mean by day and night?

Won't particularly matter with what we're doing now but it will do when we go on to seasons. Very important that the pole is pointing top and bottom. You don't have to do it perfectly round because the earth isn't perfectly round. You don't have to draw the continent and oceans exactly as they are because it's a diagram.

You need crayons, there are some crayons in there, cupboard. If you were away last week can you please leave space to catch up with the writing which you will do in your own time. All right. Does anybody have a problem with what they've got to do before we start put your hand up if you don't know what to do. Luke a problem? I hope you're not talking to me like that. Please may I borrow a rubber sir. Already? Why don't you ask for a rubber when you make a mistake. You haven't made a mistake yet? You'll be writing in pen though.

I want this work this week to be as good if not better than the work you did for me last week. Which I'm very pleased with, very impressed. Yes James? Yes they're erm  don't forget your title, the title for your diagrams as well, day and night the same title will do, in pen underlined. Come on then Luke. You want a rubber don't you? Can I just erm, carry on working but just look this way a minute please. Have you seen have you seen this? Beautiful work. Well done. I've not graded your work I will give you A Bs and Cs next time.

       " \"Of course you can. Yes. There's a tin full of counters you can use. Well good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen. Before we start the presentation I'd mention there will be hard copies of the slides available, the video is for internal use only and there should be plenty of time for questions at the end. Six months ago we reported interim results,fifty eight percent down on the previous year but held out hope for a stronger performance in the second half, in the event our os optimism was justified. And in the second half when we always make the bulk of our profits, we fought back and our second pre-tax er, er performance, exceeded by some five million er, that of nineteen ninety. This wasn't sufficient to make up the ground lost in the first half and the outcome for the year as a whole, you now see. I'd like to draw your attention to a couple of points on this slide. First, the high earnings per share after extraordinary items, which is increasingly relevant to the proposed new accounting standards and secondly,that we're recommending a maintained dividend which we can prudently do, bearing in mind  our reasonable dividend cover and low net debt. We now come to the breakdown of trading profit by sector. Profits er, from oil services were well and educational publishing in the U S er, put in a very strong performance. Frank  will be going into more detail on these and our other businesses, which are all facing an uphill struggle, particularly in the U K and North America, both in deep recession and which you can see continue to make up the bulk of our markets. I'd add that at the moment we do not see any upturn in any of our major markets. Before handing over to Frank, I'd like to emphasise some of the key points of nineteen ninety one. Yes, we did have a strong profits recovery in the second half, greatly helped by oil services and U S educational publishing. We had a strong improvement in operating cash generation and that and the sale of  brought net debt down to a low level. B Sky B is now profitable of trading level, we increased our stake in it during the year from eleven percent to sixteen percent. Frank  became the new chairman and we believe that in due course, it's gonna generate substantial profits. Finally, I'd like to mention that we shall be recommending for shareholders a one for one scrip issue. This isn't intended as any particular message, but we are now one of the weightiest shares in the F T S E index and be we believe that it should improve the market liquidity of the shares. Now, Frank. Good morning everyone. I think when we talked to you er, when we presented the interims er, we talked about the action we would be taking given the difficult circumstances and er, if I could just remind you. We said we'd be going for cost space reductions. Well, we've done that, as we said we would and of course, in a business such as Pearson, which is a people business er, although we regularly monitor employment statistics, such as total employ total number of employees er, revenue per employee, cost per employee, profit per employee, there are times when we have to take er, difficult decisions and er, so we've gone in for a lot of redundancy, which we'll see in, in er during the next slide or two. But not just redundancy, we've taken initiatives in lots of other areas, we'll show you those as well. On capital spending we tended to concentrate on that spending which would show a return on the investment and if we could we've postponed er, maintenance spending erm, renewal of cars and that kind of thing. All of our Chief Executives accept er, cash generation targets erm, either cash generation or ratio of working capital to er, to sales and that kind of thing and erm, as well as er, profit to turn over issues and that's er, stood us in good stead this year. And we've been saying to Chief Executives, if you can't get the profit or you can't get the sales, well at least concentrate on trying to, trying to get the cash, get the debtors in, that kind of thing. And we think that's er, er, gone well too. And of course, we've tried to reinforce our market positions and I think we've succeeded in er, in virtually all of our businesses. Er, now if we look at the er, staff reduction by sector. Again, when I spoke to you during the interims, I was expecting redundancies during the year of, of er, about a thousand. In the event we've achieved fourteen hundred, nearly fourteen hundred, and that follows on the six hundred redundancies we had last year. Er, and as well as the erm, staff reduction initiatives er, staff reduction initiatives that this showed you the savings er, in the year. Most of the savings of course coming next year, a small saving this year. As well as that, we managed to restrict the pay round for the whole of Pearson in the U K to four percent. Going to other cost saving initiatives erm, in the newspapers we've, we made lots of savings in newsprint. This was usually negotiating better discounts, in some of our production centres reducing the web width, which of course saves newsprint and in many areas er, in the regional newspapers reducing the distribution of our freeze in  areas where we thought it er, it wouldn't affect, it wouldn't have affected the performance of the title. Er, on the book side we've managed er, considerable reductions in freight costs, warehousing and printing. In entertainment I'd think the reduc cost reductions there were pretty well, er restricted to good housekeeping, but from fine china er, we managed to transfer the, the er, work in the Minton factory to the Knowle Street factory and that allowed us to close the Minton factory and quite apart from the redundancies that entailed, we saved something like two hundred and fifty thousand er, non staff related overhead. Er, group wide, in the U S A, the er, New York headquarters staff under David  's direction achieved a very worthwhile er, reduction in telecoms, two million a year and this was by er, aggregating our telecoms erm, business and negotiating an er, one contract. And they've just about completed a second one on freight which will save two million dollars a year. And we're looking to, to do similar transactions in the U K, but of course with the lack of, or the reduced competition in the U K we, we may not do quite as well. Er, on capital ex expenditure er, most of the capital you see there was erm, investment which will show a return er, on investment. Er, the big items were Brighton where we're spending ten, eleven millions er, with the new press and the new building, which is pretty well completed er, it very shortly will be on-stream. Erm, the oil company continue to invest in capital expenditure, as it should do and er, most of that is spent between services, drilling and, and radar and at, Tussauds we continue to invest er, Alton Towers has got er, the Ghost House opening today and the Runaway Train and we were finishing off the Marylebone Road project, which is a very big, big project involving er,re the complete refurbishment er, new shops and a view right there in the basement. And so the er, the reward for our firm grip on costs and the concentration on cash is a favourable swing of, of forty seven er, million pounds in the full year and there should be more to come because now we're at the end of our er, capital spend on newspapers er, the newspapers will of course, become very substantial cash generators. We look at the er, profit of the newspapers individually. Of course it was a very, very difficult year for the Financial Times. Ad sales were down fourteen percent er, but we er, we increased our market share and in fact our market share was the best since nineteen eighty six er, when the F T was the market leader. Circulation was down four percent, but overseas we increased our circulation by five percent and again in the U K in, in newspaper sales we held our market share. Er, Profile did very well, increasing sales by twelve percent last year and following the deal with Texline er, sales moving well ahead again this year. Er, Les Echo had problems on the medical side, partly government regulation, partly the market and we've reorganized er, two medical divisions into one and that should give us er, give us some cost saving there. The newspaper circulation was up three percent to a new record at one hundred and twelve thousand, seven hundred and that was a very good performance. Ad volume was down erm, but not as much as in the U K.\\nThe economists had a tremendous year erm, really bucking the trend and contributing about five million pounds to er, F T's er, associates profits. The circulation was a new record and four hundred and eighty five thousand, nine hundred by year end and it just seems to go from strength to strength. Er, we swopped our sharing expense on the er,Sp Spanish financial daily er, with cash for a twenty five percent stake in the  Group and er, one of the things this er, does is to give us a stake in, in Marca, which is the second biggest newspaper in Spain and incidentally has the same social and economic profile as El , The Times of Spain er, and it's a sport paper which sells seven days a week, two hundred and thirty four thousand circulation and its nearer, nearest competitor sells one fifty thousand. It's a very big cash generator for the very high cover price and that should benefit from this year's Olympics. Expansion itself went up erm, circulation by twenty three er, percent last year and ad sales were up fourteen percent. Westminster Press had a very difficult year. Ad volume was down er, three point four percent overall. Nearly all of that was in classifieds where erm, the volume was down about er, eleven point eight, nearly twelve percent and er, revenue down by eight point three percent. Situations vacant in particular showed a very, a very big drop and erm, and in fact we, the yield was lower than the year before, but we've er, continued with our pac press rationalization programme and er, I think as I mentioned at the interims, the Basildon Evening Echo is now printed on the F T's presses, which incidentally has got the contract to and is printing er,. Erm, but W P continued to er, hang on to its market leadership in virtually every centre and erm, despite the difficult year managed to launch er, several new titles. Er, if we turn to the revenue split I think this underscores the recession er, and you'll notice that there's a much lesher lesser proportion of revenue coming from advertising. Er, they're overall figures, but for instance the F T, which er, the year before seventy five percent of its revenue came from advertising and er in, in ninety one it was down to seventy percent. If we go on to books erm, I think that Longman performance is exceptionally good erm, of course for book business it's very much first half, second half, most of the profit coming in second half, but er, erm, Longman only dropping seven percent on the year before seems to me a particularly good performance given the environment and in fact it generated more operating cash flow than the year before. It did very well with English Language Teaching sales er, in Europe and Asia as planned and its medical and professional sponsored adver erm, business in, in Japan grew much quicker than we expected. But education in the U K and Canada was very, very tough indeed. Pitman, which is the U K leading er, business book publisher increased sales by sixteen percent and Alhambra after the er, reorganization is doing rather well and the first book we've published on the new Spanish educational curriculum is forty percent ahead of er, budget. Ali Addison Wesley was er, one of our stars this year. Er, a fourth year of record profits, record er, sales, record margin, with the schools business thirty seven percent ahead of the previous year with our successful maths programme, aided and abetted by  er, the business that produces the manipulatives to go with the maths programme. The college market in the U S A was the weakest for decades, but our college sales were up ten percent. Internationally we're up thirteen percent and in the Europe and, Europe and Pacific twenty percent. And on the er, general book front, the erm, Iron John was on the New York Times best sellers list for fifty one weeks and twelve of those at number one. I'll deal with Penguin separately. Federal and Capital we er, is, is a small business er, but highly profitable and er, it's a subscription business so that the cash comes in advance and er, the er, the only criticism I have of Federal and Capital is that it's, it, it, it, it would be nice if it was five times bigger than it is. But we're working on that. Looking at Penguin er, it was a very difficult year but the profit you see was erm, is after providing for the losses up to the date we disposed of Smith Mark and also making further provision on, on er, leases when we moved out of the other buildings, centralized the editorial and er, administrative functions into one office and, and but for that you would see that the er, the Penguin profit would have moved ahead from the year before. Erm, some of you are very critical of, of, of the Penguin operation when you were in the U S A but I have to tell you, they did achieve record sales there last year and increased market share and in fact the children's er, book publishing was twenty percent ahead of the year before. In the U K the improvement plans we've been working on for the last two years have been very successfully implemented but they've been overtaken by the U K recession. In the U S A we've appointed John  President and so we've got the structure that we wanted, with Peter  as, as Chairman at the top and concentrating on er, on publishing as he ought to, one of the great publishers of the world, dealing with the authors, dealing with the agents and dealing with the editorial staff. With a Managing Director in U K, Trevor  and a Managing Director, President in the U S A, John  and er, John  had a very good start and we're sure this will be an improved er, stretcher from our business. Turning to, turning to entertainment and media investments er, it was a very tough year for the Tussaud group and starting with the er, Gulf War er, and erm, the only Tussaud business that, that does a lot of business in the first quarter is erm, Marylebone Road and you may remember that the Gulf War caused foreign tourists to stop coming to London and er, also erm, British tourists stopped coming to London and during that time attendances were actually twenty five percent down, so the recovery from there is, has been very good. Our highlight was the opening of Scenerama, our Dutch exhibition which opened in mid year and that's well ahead of budget and by year end we'd had six hundred thousand admissions through the turnstiles. Alton er, did well er, to restrict attendances to a five percent drop. I should remind you, of course, that we have the usual three million black hole Alton this year, the first quarter. At Chessington attendances pretty well stood still, again a very good performance in my view and er, justification for the capital spending that's gone on in recent years to bring that er, to bring Chessington to where we want it to be. Warwick too had a very good performance and er, and maintained its er, attendances. Er, turning to the media investments, well we all tend to think that the er, the bids tended to be on the high side but er, at least Yorkshire got the licence for the next ten years and they have the option in ninety eight to go for a further ten years and I can tell you er, because I've had er, lots of conversations with Clive  that they're really working on, on making the best improving their returns from that franchise and I'm quite sure they'll succeed. Pickwick as you know we sold er, during the year, or sorry when the year ended, this year. Turning to er, Camco, our old services campaign, again that er, I think that was a very, very good performance er, sales were ahead of last year, trading profit ahead of last year and they even proved, improved the margin very, very slightly and that's our second star of the year. Erm, Products and Services did very well internationally, in fact the entire business did well internationally, generally, particularly in Venezuela, Nigeria and by year end the er, joint venture in Russia was er, was complete and ready to start. We also did a very important er, technology transfer to Czechoslovakia, which er, unsubmersible pump neck technology and that's tended to, to erm, hide a slight delcl er decline in the last quarter of the year, normally in oil most of the profit or more of the profit comes in the second half than the first, but with the Gulf War last year oil prices were pretty firm and er, so we've made er, quite reasonable profits in the, in the er, first half and so too in the second half, but in the last quarter they've been showed up by that technology er, transfer and the er, U S oil price is er, is, is er stag the U K's is stagnant, the U S is stagnant in oil and the gas prices are very, very far down, they're well down. Turning to investment banking and I should just remind you that er, we take fifty percent of  Brothers' profits and ten percent of New York and Paris and given the conditions, given the environment last year, I don't think  need be ashamed of the performance er, although in London the only business to really come in, come in with impressive returns was er, asset trading money, broking and banking. There was erm, a great reduction in corporate activity but corporate finance kept very busy er, with their value services and money raising and er, we were responsible for the National Power flotation and the disposal of Gratton. In Paris er,were top of the M & A league but the volume was well down on the record nineteen ninety. New York too did well, advising on thirty seven acquisitions er, thirty seven transactions, including  acquisition of Tonka and  acquisition of the Max Factor division of Revlon. On fine china erm, although profits were down, Royal Doulton did manage a margin of eight point five percent and here again improved the cash flow on nineteen ninety. And they continued to develop their distribution and retail network and now over half of our sales are overseas and er, we developed our direct mail and our chain store business er, even though demand was down. In fact we made most of our profits or a lot of our profits last year by erm, sheer volume and, and, and a decline in yield. Erm, a bigger sale of the smaller price it of the lesser priced items. I mentioned earlier that we closed the erm, Royal Minton factory and four other factories are on short time, but we continued to invest in operation efficiency to improve our competitive position and er, now over to er, to James . James. Good morning everyone. Well as you can see from what Frank said, the six main sectors overall didn't fare too badly, sixteen percent drop in aggregate at the trading level and in fact er, our other interest less expenses were actually ended on eleven percent because we had a million pounds more profit from Lakeside when we sold the Tesco's site. However, the damage was done at the discontinued line which simply reflects the fact that we had er, Elserver in for two and a half months in nineteen ninety one, as opposed to twelve months the year before. So trading profits down twenty four percent and although the interest charge was down er, quite sharply, largely, of course, as a reduction in net depth through the Elserver sale, profits before tax ended up as you heard before, twenty three percent lower. If we go from that to the earnings, there's another erm, er, slide to take us through that. I think the most interesting point here is the tax charge which is two percentage points down on the year before and that really is prior year adjustments, there are other pluses and minuses but that's a significant reason. Extraordinary profits, you may be surprised to see are only twelve point nine million after the Elserver sale but that is a function of the write back of good will on the disposal of Elserver which you will see explained in the preliminary statement, thus reducing the er, profit from two hundred and twenty nine million, which was the estimate at the interim, to thirty five million for the year as a whole. We did that in the  with the erm, urgent issues task force new standard on good will. We had to do it cos I'm a member of the task force. I mean I'd be sacked otherwise. So, earnings after extraordinaries up fifty four percent er, even so. Now, the profits, the profits you've seen where the profits came down, let's look at it another way and that is really to see er, the impact per the year before. Fifty three million down in profits overall. Foreign exchange worked to our advantage this year, the dollar was at one seventy two on average. Er, we had, obviously, no help from acquisitions because of the Elserver effect less interest. Our exceptional items were rather heavier in nineteen ninety one, you won't be surprised after what you heard from Frank about the er, number reductions. We had redundancy cost, we had lease provision and one or two other items. So, the underlying performance, in fact, accounted for only forty million out of the fifty three million reduction in profits. Now, again, we need to distribute the underlying performance because it wasn't equally distributed between the various sectors. Now, clearly the two major er, baddies there were the newspapers and investment banking and that reflects their operational gearing and the sharp decline in revenue you are well aware of. The two pluses are books, thanks largely to Addison Wesley, thankfully decisively so and the oil services business and the only other item worth reflecting, I think worth er, remarking on, is in fact that if you take out the black hole effect er, the entertainment fall was only two million and I think that is a creditable performance. So, if we now leave profits and go to cash. Er, the cash flow is slightly crowded and to we've split it into two slides. You can see er, at the top, of course the profits were down but nonetheless er, I think quite encouragingly, we have higher operational cash flow and I'll go into a little detail of that later. Er, a sharp fall in the interest, tax and dividends line led to the forty five million turnround at what we regard the crucial measure, net funds from operation. This tells you whether you're generating money for shareholders or where they consume you. If we look at the next slide, you'll then see er, the change from net funds from operations, plus eighteen million, down to the various large reduction in borrowings, you're already aware of and, of course, the erm, disposals less acquisitions as it should read for ninety one er, stands out there. We spent only really modest amounts, apart from there was a small further investment in B Sky B, nothing else worth recording. So, turnround in a net debt of three hundred and twenty million and I think we will look again now at the net funds from operation and look at the analysis a little further. Trading profit less potential was only down twenty five million because, of course, a good slice of the reduction in trading profits came from er, associates, mainly Elserver which is rather niggly in distributions. The working capital outflow was controlled and was only er, sixteen million more working capital, which is considerably better than the year before and then finally you had the er, improvement in the capital expenditure. Capital expenditure less depreciation is eighteen million better, that's of course a function of two er, elements. The reduction in the  and the persistent rise the depreciation charge, which is going over the last four years as we maintain a high level of capital spending. Improvement in operating cash flow was then compounded by er, the financing line and that really is overwhelmingly er, a reduction in tax paid, function of the lower profits than previous years and of course, the impact of consortium relief in B Sky B. Net change, forty five million pounds and that we regard as one of the most satisfying outcomes for the year. Now Elserver also impacted, of course, materially on the balance sheet as the next slide will show us. Curiously, net trading assets are virtually unchanged between the two years. This is obviously a coincidence, since it's a function of so many different things including exchange effects. However, the balance between debt and equity is remarkably changed. You'll have the sharp improvement in shareholders' funds resulting from the write back of good will on the Elserver disposal and the consequent reduction in net borrowings, from four hundred and five to a hundred and eighteen million. Now, net debt of the hundred and eighteen million is of course, er, a balance of two items. We have our debt itself, the gross debt, which came down about a hundred and twenty million and that is all set by a substantially increased cash balance. The cash is overwhelmingly held in sterling. We need a hundred million of it to er, pay back  Coupon Bond that matures in May and by the same reason, the final column shows that the balance of our debt between fixed and floating er, will change, other things being equal on the pro-forma basis. At the moment or at the year end of our variable debt, commercial paper in the United States, a very cheap form of debt, formed the overwhelming proportion. Our fixed debt is accounted for by our quoted sterling bonds and er, the balance of a medium tone note programme which we have outstanding in the United States. On the pro-forma basis, our hopes, which of course not yet been born out, that interest rates will be declining er, will give us some advantage by the year end, as a number of caps and swabs which we put in place during nineteen ninety one, unwind. Now, balance sheet with the lower debt and promising cash flow, of course, impacts on financial ratios and I think that this is the best measure of how we come through nineteen ninety one rather than the profits. The dividend cover is not wonderful but it's perfectly adequaly adequate as Michael  said at the beginning. Interest cover was already strong and is now at nearly ten times patently er, a very healthy level and whether or not you add back the good will on other er, acquisitions, I dare say the ratio is at a very low level indeed. Clearly, we have plenty of powder and it's dry. Thank you. Er, we are going to be joined er, for questions by David , who is er, the Chairman of Camco and the u the Pearson Executive Director, resident in the U S.\\nMichael , who is er, C E O group and Hugh  who is C E O of Westminster press er, financial newspapers. When you er, ask a question first time could you, could you say your name and the organization that you represent. Could I have the first question please? It's Mark  from the Daily Telegraph. Can I just ask you if your position on the Daily Mirror is still that you're not at all interested in it, or is there a prospect that you may change your mind when you've seen the figures from the Mirror? Er, we had a good look at, at the figures, although they weren't totally finalized we had a pretty good understanding of the situation and I think it is highly unlikely that we would er, seek to re-open any negotiations. Er, Jason  from the Independent. Just a supplementary on that. This er, your comment that you had a good look at the figures, severely confused the merchant bankers who are advising the Mirror group as they, they didn't feel that they'd finalized the figures themselves. So, did you have a, a mole inside the Mirror Group? Er, James would you like to answer that question? Well, I'm not a mole. No, I think that we had a fairly clear idea, certainly on the pension fund, we've not obviously got accurate numbers, a clear idea of the broad er, shape of, of the problems and erm, that allowed us, without having to wait for very accurate figures, to draw the conclusions about the scale of the problem, the amount of investment we'd like to, we need to make and thus erm, whether or not it was of interest to pursue. You didn't need to have a, a long form report in front of you I think, to draw the conclusion. Er, Richard  from the Scotsman. Can I just ask you to be slightly more specific on your first answer. Does that mean you're not actually interested in any parts of the Mirror Group? I refer particularly also to the, the Daily Record and the Sunday Mail in Scotland. Er, I'll be more, I'll be clearer. Er, we are not interested in any parts of the Mirror Group. Er, Raymond , Financial Times. Companies with as strong a balance sheet as yours have been known to seek acquisitions er, in the midst of a very deep recession. Why have you not done so? Er, there are a couple of factors there. One is that we do make acquisitions, we on, on the whole er, prefer er, organic growth because it is normally more profitable and the prices you have to pay for acquisitions er, tend to put significant premiums on the companies you buy which you may er, in the longer run eventually erm, er, turn into shareholder value. But er, any acquisition has to fit extremely well strategically and it has to be at a price that we consider to be a, a, a good price. Now, so far er, the acquisitions that have come onto the market haven't really reflected er, the trading conditions in which all companies in this country have been operating for the last eighteen months. In oth other words, there haven't been particularly good value acquisitions that are strategically suitable for us. It doesn't mean to say that we are not on the, alert and on the look out and er, I think those opportunities erm, er, will still occur and that er, we will be involved. Now, there's one other element that's worth mentioning. Erm, it is perhaps only in the last er, six months or so that the erm, turnaround in the fortunes of erm, er, B Sky B have been acknowledged and er, I think there has been an element in our thinking that we wanted to keep our  dry er, until such time as er, B Sky B which we have great belief and faith in and our, as you know we increased our investment during the year erm, sees its way through to profitability and I'm happy to say that that's happening now at a reab reasonable rate and that that means that it is highly unlikely that the hundred and thirty million of guarantees that we still have outstanding to B Sky B are likely to be called. So, we're in a pretty strong position to make acquisitions if they appear at the right price and they fit our strategic framework.\",\n",

Erm, you, a lot of people now talk as though it's erm, plain sailing or flying for B Sky B and it's gonna be er, hunky-dory, whereas Anglia Television have just written their stake down to a prenominal amount because they don't think it's gonna make, stand a chance of making a profit before the turn of the millennium. Do you think they're being too gloomy and do you think certain other people are being too euphoric? I think that the reasons people have written down their erm, er, holdings in B, B Sky B have varied. Er, sometimes it's for tax reasons, sometimes it's for er, for, for, for erm, er, reasons such as last year when er, we wrote down our, our stake by some seventy one million erm, it was because at that point the financing for B Sky B was not yet er, at all clear because the shareholders had been unable to agree at that point erm, that they would guarantee the two hundred or so million that er, needed to go in before the er, project became successful and so there was a genuine doubt on the financing. Er, I don't know if James again, you might like to comment. We'll keep Frank in reserve, he's a Chairman at B Sky B.\\nEr, I think er, Frank will correct me if we're closer to the, to the sharp edge than Anglia, who have got a very small stake and only in the equity of B S B H, are coming very low in the pecking order to get their money, whereas er, where there is a whole complex er, schedule of who will participate in the er, substantial cash flow that we expect to emanate from B Sky B in due course, but I think that's the main reason why Anglia, I haven't talked to David . Frank, do you talk? Well, I mean it's, it's definitely tax driven. I mean erm, Anglia talked er, talked to me anyway as Chairman of B Sky B erm, before they, before they did the write off and it's, it's just tax driven. So you're right at the head of the pecking order? Pardon? You're right at the head of the pecking order, when the cash generation starts you'll be first in line? Er, we will, but the pecking order er, the pecking order is the subject of agreement and it's public. Er, but I mean clearly the, the debt and the guarantees are paid down first and so for the reason we are high up in the pecking order, because we provided the er, the loans and the guarantees. Yes? Following that up when, when can your long suffering shareholders er, expect to see any return on the B Sky B stake and a follow up on that? Now, you've got sixteen percent and you're the Chairman when shouldn't you equity account it? Well, I'm not certain our shareholders are long suffering. Erm, in fact I think the turnaround has er, has been remarkably quick and remember, we saved our shareholders from having to write the lot off. So I wouldn't accept your description justified. Mick. Mm. Take issue beyond that. Sorry, what was the second part of the question? Well, the first part of the question was when, when will they start seeing a return back on that money and secondly, when shouldn't you equity account it? Well, er, equity accounting, James is better placed to answer that question than me. Erm, I'd be very surprised if, if cash, if, if B Sky B doesn't start to trade at a profit overall in erm, in the second half of ninety three. And, and thereafter cash can flow out because the first thing that flows out are loans and guarantees. So we're, we're quite close to getting cash back from B Sky B. Sorry, can I get it absolutely clear. I didn't fully understand that. Are you actually saying er, money will actually be raised in addition to the financing charges in the second half of ninety three? No, no, I'm talking about profit from the, from the business. Money from the business. Just to clear another point up. Last autumn it was stated in a document that there would have to be further subscriptions of finance before er, the project became profitable. Are you now saying that's no longer necessary? That is the two hundred million that I was referring to er, earlier, wasn't in place at the time that we made our write there. So, that was all the remark applied to? Well yes, but that, remember we provided for up to two hundred million which we thought would see us through to the end of ninety two. Now it looks as if not all of that will be called, but we can't be sure at this stage. But it looks as if it may not all be called. Should I just comment on the assessing the equity accounting point. Er, the present situation is that there's complex erm, arrangements for the exercise of votes, basically unanimity is required and in those circumstances we as a shareholder cannot exercise material influence which is a necessary pre-condition for equity accounting.\",\n",
       " \"Ourselves. Roger  from the Guardian. Erm, can we, er, two separate questions. One is going back to the issue of acquisitions erm, where are you most interested, both geographically and er, as far as your operation is concerned, where are you most interested in making acquisitions? Er, and a completely separate question now, entertainment er, could you just tell us a bit more about what's happening at Alton Towers and also how you think it's gonna be affected by EuroDisney? Yes er, well I think we might, I'll answer the second question but we'll, we'll, we'll answer the first question but we'll ask Michael, who's right here to, to comment on entertainment. In fact today, this afternoon we're launching a whole new area at Alton Towers which is additional to anything before erm, Frank referred to it briefly, there's a Runaway, so called Runaway Train ride, there's a Ghost House and that's all part of a new complex, which we've got longer term plans to expand further. Er, that's costing something up to ten million pounds approximately. So, we have erm, underlying confidence in the long term future of Alton Towers, I think that's very important to state. As far as EuroDisney is concerned, I personally welcome its establishment in France. I think that it is going to have a good effect on improving trading for the better parks and attractions in this country and as you know I think, Alton Towers is the leading er, park of its kind in this country, Chessington which we also own is the second er, leading park, one and a half million visitors a year, Alton Towers approximately two million visitors a year in this country. Both offering excellent value for money. The point I think that has to be understood about EuroDisney, which perhaps hasn't been properly perceived yet by the public is that it is very much a destination for the British public. It is not a place you can just go to for the day and therefore you need to spend at least a couple of days getting there overnight, coming back again and er, for a family of four I calculate that even taking one's own car across the Channel, the average cost for a family of four, is of the order of five or six hundred pounds. I don't see how you can do it cheaper for that. Don't forget to get into Disney is twenty five pounds, which is more than double what we're charging at Alton Towers for example. Er, the comparable cost for a family of four in this country to go to somewhere like Alton Towers or to Chessington in your own car including the cost of petrol of getting there is of the order of fifty or sixty pounds at the outside. In other words, only ten percent of the total costs of going to Disney. Therefore, the one is a destination which you'll probably find you'd prefer to go to for a long weekend or perhaps a, part of your annual holiday etcetera, our parks are places you go to for a day out and I think therefore there is a very er, strong difference between the sort of visit and because I feel that EuroDisney which will undoubtedly will be good, it's a proven formula er, it's run well er, it appeals to a lot of people and therefore it will be I think er, successful, exactly how successful I obviously can't say, but it will be successful, it will certainly attract British visitors, but they'll come back, looking er, with certain higher expectation, a value for money, quality etcetera, etcetera. And we believe we already offer that, I think the figures indicate that and therefore in the medium and the longer term I believe that our attractions will undoubtedly benefit and I would finally say that if you er, go back and look at the history of Disney in America, after the establishment of Disney Parks in America there was a big improvement in extension of the amusement parks in the rest of America which er, the traditional theme parks, so called, in America grew in the period after the establishment of Disney Land in California and I think a similar sort of thing is going to happen, not perhaps just in this country er, but also in Europe generally. In certain locations there are clearly planning problems, environmental problems that sort of thing, in establishing parks but I believe er, and I know a lot other people in the leisure business believe that there will be a growth. But the ones that'll gain will be the quality ones offering the best value for money and as you know, Pearson believes in quality and certainly value for money and therefore I believe we will benefit from that. Thank you Michael. On, on acquisitions, well running through the group, the best of banking er, er strategies to remain non capital intensive and strongly cash generative er, know, you know we've had a twenty million investment erm, A & A er, a Swiss er, house, we're extending our networks. We're not, er we're not the best thing about  money and I wouldn't see that happening in the future. On fine china, we're already the largest fine china, fine bone china manufacturer in the world. We might make the odd selective acquisition but not vast amounts of money going on acquisitions there either. In oil  services, in the future there could be further major acquisitions but er, over the past three years we've er, undertaken a whole series of acquisitions and er, and for the moment I wouldn't see anything er, in the, in the major line there, although you never know if some, even sometimes opportunities you aren't capable of creating erm, er, because the er, situation is not right er, do occur and I wouldn't rule it out but erm, er, we haven't erm any major acquisition er, on, on, on the carpet there at the moment. Erm, on entertainment, we're spending a lot of money on organic growth and have done over the past two or three years and er, it's very well spent but again, we're growing our businesses, erm, er, rather than acquiring them. Alton Towers clearly is an exception but again, you have to pay a lot of money for it and it takes quite some time to get the return er, back and, and I would say that erm, many of Michael's erm, er, organic erm, er, expenditure will, will erm, provide er, a really good return rather quicker but in the long run we think Alton is good. Erm, now that leaves us with er, really the er, the publishing, the educational publishing er, the newspapers, magazines, electronic publishing, in all those areas we're active and on the lookout. We certainly, if you look at the breakdown of our sales er, we only sell about a hundred and fifty er, million pounds worth er, of goods and services in Asia, Pacific erm, we would certainly like to make acquisitions in that area just as we did in North America er, in the seventies and eighties and we have now small Pearson er, office, for instance in Tokyo, it's quite slow,erm, er, in that area but certainly we're on the lookout for acquisitions in, in Asia, Pacific. In all of those publishing areas that you've mentioned, newspapers, books, electronic \\nYes? Karen  from News Australia. Would that include taking a stake in the er, the Fairfax float when erm, that takes place later this year? Erm, we, we, we really er, like to be in a position of control in any of the acquisitions er, that we make er, where we are associates rather than, than having a hundred percent or a least erm, over fifty. It is because for strategic reasons we've very want to make the investment, there's no other way of doing it. Erm, to cut a long story short, if a attractive Fairfax erm, individual enterprise came up, we would be far more interested than taking a stake that was a, just an investment. Er, the chances of it coming up seem to me highly unlikely. Clearly, if it did we'd be interested. Is your cost er, programme effectively complete er, or are we gonna be seeing more substantial redundancies this year? Well, we've got our cost reductions as an ongoing process er, so it's never complete, you're always looking for ways to, to become more efficient or effective but I don't anticipate any redundancies er, any further redundancies but obviously if, if, if systems become available which improve our efficiency and effectiveness we, we have to take account of it. What effect would a Labour government have on, in the U K, on Pearson's businesses? Well, there's been quite a lot of, of, of chat recently that, that erm, because of cross-media ownership erm, companies that are involved in cross-media ownership would have, have problems. I think that it is difficult to see under any clear complexion of government that our present holdings er, in newspapers, which are mainly the Financial Times which has a small erm, comparatively small circulation for a national newspaper and less than twenty percent in a television company would, would be affected by, by any government. Er, whether they, a different government would legislate erm, against people having more than a twenty percent stake in er, B Sky B for instance remains to be seen. It must be quite possible, which might mean that there will be some more shares er, available there but er, that is complete speculation. Erm, I don't think that er, in structural terms therefore a, a change of government would er, make a great deal, a difference, then you come to er, the general effect of a, a change of government er, I think at the moment we're living in a situation of uncertainty and er, a clear majority erm, for any party would probably from a business point of view erm, remove the uncertain short term. I think the view you take of the longer term, erm, er, becomes individual and speculative er, as once again you've got to erm, er, come to conclusions about inflation, about encouragement to the economy and er, you can read in many a good newspaper erm, their views on that. Thanks er, did the provision for er, properties like Penguin and four and a half million for the year, did all of that come in the second half, because it's noticeable that Penguin is ahead something like what, thirty two percent, second half on second half. So if that four and a half million was all incurred in the second half its underlying growth rate was something like sixty percent. Er, were there any sort of distortions there in the second half period? Well, Penguin always makes er, er, most of its profits in the second half but, but James would you like to answer. It's more in the second half. My colleague Mr  who is closer to the ground reminds me that I think there was a small provision in the first half. But we then took a view about, about future years because in a sense we've always been, obviously had to provide for the er, year impression. Discretion now taking a much more realistic view about the New York property market which is, office market which is as lousy if not lousier than erm, than London and say that we ain't gonna relet these, we're not gonna sub-let these properties, let's take, let's take a hit, let's clean it out now. And that was, that element was in the second half. Sorry, would there be any exceptional stock provisions that were released, made in the first half, released into the second half for example? So you talked about \\nPenguin? Yes, cos you talked about\\nNo, don't make no, no, no. That wouldn't be the case, no. Are you er, going to have an extraordinary profit from the sale of the stake in Pickwick?\",\n",
       " \"Small loss. Small loss. Er, Hugh, would you, you haven't had a chance to say anything. Would you like to er, make any comments on er, how a change of government might effect the Westminster Press? Well, I think it erm, very, I mean I think as you said Chairman, if erm, there's a clear majority for one party it'll unblock a whole lot of delay and decision making which I think is going on and I think that that should be helpful. I suppose the only problem is if there's er, gonna be another general election shortly after the one we're about to have, that'll just er, create a bit more uncertainty for a bit longer I'm afraid. Er right. Robert  of Robert Fleming. I noticed one of the, the Sunday papers had a little bit of a dig on you on strategy over the weekend. Perhaps er, you'd just like to remind us erm, what your strategy is and no doubt how unfair you felt that comment was? Well, our strategy is to be a concentrated conglomerate. In other words, sticking to those sectors that we know and understand and which we chose for the nineties because we believe they had good growth prospects. Er, we built on those sectors, during the er, past year with the initial uncertainty on the B Sky B situation er, we have been managing erm, our way through the recession, you've heard from Frank er, about the er, immediate short term measures we've taken. Er, but in the long run we're on the lookout to continue to build both organically and by acquisition where appropriate er, on, on the main sectors. And you've all heard the theme of quality which, which runs throughout our strategic picking. Sorry, Eric er, there was something put up there, beyond your at first. Yes,, James . Erm, James put a slide up about accept  included a figure of erm, eight million for exceptionals. I wonder if you could just explain the consistent parts of that figure? The eight million on exceptionals, James would you? That, that is the, the change in exceptionals compared with nineteen ninety. It isn't the total charge. And it comprises er, redundancy provisions er, costs on abortive er, acquisitions or erm, consulting projects er, lease provisions in Penguin and other odds and sods bluntly. I think we're talking at cross purposes. I think the slide that Frank was referring to was the total charge for the year. The eight million is the difference in the exceptional charge for ninety one compared with nineteen ninety. That was a various analysis.\",\n",
       " \"Er, Eric. Can I . You indicated that there's no sign of any er, improvement in your main markets er, but looking for er, optimistic er, calculations could you give us any indications of the er, the benefits of the er, non recurrence of the Gulf War in the first half? Well, the non recurrence of Gulf War in the first half is pretty well balanced by the recession that is taking place at the moment and is er, showing as we all know, little signs of lifting. I think a change in the political, direct and when say it, I don't mean a change, I mean a, erm, the outcome of the solution erm, to, to, to the present uncertainty, I think er, will be greatly helpful er, once the election is over in the U K.\\nEr, but it is, it's very, it's very early days er, as we all know. You showed us a slide with net savings for nineteen ninety two of twenty million. Can you actually just take us through those er on one of you slides you had a thing, net savings \\nEr the net savings on redundancies of twenty million pounds? Are they only redundancies or is it just a net saving? Oh, the net savings altogether. Frank will now take us through the, the net savings of twenty million on redundancies. You've done it once. Yeah. Well, the twenty million obviously just comes er, in prop well not in proportion because the salary levels differ but in proportion to the numbers er, made redundant in the individual companies. It's quite difficult to, to get at erm, the other, all the other costs because they're a myriad of tiny things. I mean the big ones erm, obviously are the erm, savings of the U S A on telecommunications and freight er, but then there's lots and lots of things, for instance, the one I mentioned at Minton, two hundred and fifty thousand and so in all of our businesses, you know those, many, many small items. Is this a combination of the impact of the redundancies plus all these other , not just redundancies? Yes. Can I pick up on your comment, you do not see any upturn in any of your major markets. Advertising revenue seems to be, there seems to be sometimes that there is some slight pick up, the advertising associations predicting a pick up there, one or two companies who have been reporting, have been talking about a little upturn in the first quarter of this year. Did, you don't see any. Does that mean that they are wrong, or you're losing market share? Er, it doesn't mean that we're wrong, there are some categories of advertising er, that are showing slight signs and others that are not. Er, Frank would you like to comment? I'd, actually I think the problem is that you get the odd week er, and even the odd month, where things look better erm, but, but overall, then it slips again and er, overall erm, the end of February, there's no sign that, that volume is increasing from the previous year. Erm, and that's in the F T and that's in W P and the odd category will move. And, I talked to other publishers erm, including a very large one which will be nameless and they have a pretty good spread and their experience was the same as ours. So erm, I don't think there's any signs of advertising here. And on the, on the, on the television front again erm, there isn't a great deal on the television front and there's quite a bit of manipulation going on but erm, there isn't a great deal, deal of upturn. B Sky B is ahead of last year but I mean that's a growing business, you would expect it to be. No, no, advertising is, is still down. It's still, it's been, in the first two months it's been going down on last year in volume terms. We have Hugh  here er, Hugh, any sign of us losing market share? No sign of our newspapers losing market share, no. I think the, I mean the, the huge drop that we had in situations vacant advertising in ninety, nineteen ninety one, when we fell from, I mean our job advertising was about twenty million pounds in nineteen ninety and was down to about eleven million in ninety one. But erm, the position at the moment is that, I mean, the situation doesn't seem to be getting any worse. Erm, and there are, there are some signs of erm, odd categories of advertising being slightly up but they are need to be counter balanced by others which are down too. It's really very hard to detect any trend. Your share price seemed to take a bit of a knock the other day when Roy  made some comments about referring media conglomerates to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Firstly, would you see any problem with that under a led government directly and secondly if Rupert  were forced to sell off either some of his stake in B Sky B or some of his newspaper interests er, what would be your attitude to er, buying? Er, I don't think that er, we would be likely to have a, a problem in selling down. We only have sixteen percent of B Sky B and we have one national newspaper, the Financial Times, which, although influential, is relatively small circulation. I don't see erm, a government of any complexion being likely to insist er, on our going down er, below twenty percent er, in television. So, I don't, I don't personally see that as a direct threat at all and I think that also our, our er, our newspapers don't have any particular political bias of any sort, I think they treat each issue on its merits. So, I don't see from Pearson's point of view that, that a government of any complexion will alter what we can and er, or can't do in relation to our current er, holdings. Er, if any shareholder in B Sky B er, was selling shares, we would obviously consider er, whether we went up from our present sixteen percent er, to twenty percent but it would depend on the circumstances at the time. Derek  . Could you comment briefly on Addison Wesley and the pattern of the, the major programmes in that business and er, what the outlook is for the current year. The pattern of trading at Addison Wesley and, and the prospects for the current year er, Frank. Well, the prospects for the er, current year are still good. Erm, I mean I really can't, I don't expect them to surge ahead as they did last year but all the signs are that, that, they're doing very well and er, it's a very well managed business erm, great cost control er, I don't know whether you noticed recently that Meryl  des described the erm, the management of erm, of A W as the er, I think it was the creme de la creme of the \\nClass act of the industry. class act of the industry. So it's a very well managed business. The pattern is very much first half er, erm, loss or small profit, second half all the profit and in fact you should watch out for the bigger, the bigger Addison Wesley gets, the more the loss in the second half will be because we're investing for that sale \\nIn the first half. in the first half. They're investing in the first half in that second half. So, the chances are it will exaggerate more than anything else. Er, and we have a very strong college front list er, which we would hope would er, would make a contribution again this year, more of a contribution. Er, David , resident in America. Would you like to make any general comments on the U S? On the U S as a whole or on \\nWell, in relation perhaps to, to Addison Wesley. Well, I think that the erm, the, as Frank has said, they, they have a strong college list for this year, the school business should be they can't repeat the maths programme success of last year although there is follow up business in other states. So, there's strong underpinnings with what they've got and they are in the right areas of the market. Erm, could I ask er, a little about er, Longman and er, and er, Penguin in nineteen ninety two and particularly in the case of Longman, is the momentum of profits improvement in the second half carrying, carrying through into nineteen ninety two? Longman and Penguin in, in ninety two. Er, what, what do we say about that? Longman have made a very good start to the year and erm, and so they've progressed from day one, making last year I expect to continue. Erm, and Penguin U S again have er, made a good start and the one area, David  can talk about this better than I, but the one area that er, where there is an upturning in business activity and mo promise  have come into the U S A. So, you know, we expect erm, Penguin and A W er, Penguin U S certainly to go on and Longman to carry on as they are, improving. David, do you want to say anything about the U S? No, I think erm, in the, certainly in the consumer area which affects both Penguin and to some extent Royal Doulton, there are definite signs now of the U S economy turning around and that is likely to continue as, as the year goes on. And certainly, trade book publishing did not do at all badly in nineteen ninety one in a recessionary environment and erm, there are, as Frank has mentioned particularly within Penguin, quite a lot of internal restructuring has gone on and one would hope that margins would improve over the next few years as a result of that. While we're on the U S, could you say on the oil services er, how much of the er, good performances do you  pumps turning round and again what are the prospects of that division for the current year? Well erm, can everybody hear the questions or is it bet helpful to repeat? It is helpful to repeat. Er,to what extent er, was the er, was the performance of, of Camco erm, er dependent on a good performance from ? Well, I'd like to qualify your question if I may put words into your mouth. I think in fact  er, had been doing quite well and the specific point that Frank was referring to was erm, the technology transfer that they did with a mar large chip manufacturer, which probably made a contribution in the second half, a net contribution of about five million dollars and that offset some of the weakness in, in other parts of Camco's business in the last quarter of the year. And that er, technology transfer covers submersible pump technology which will be the standard pump line and the Czechs will have a non exclusive erm,li er licence to sell it in the Soviet Union which is a prime market er, and in other areas behind the old iron curtain. And that's an arrangement which will be carrying on over the next few years. Could you tell us please, how much we spent on Ghost House and Runaway Train and what you expect it to bring in, in rewards this year? How much we spent on Ghost House and Runaway Train er, and how much er, profit we'll bring in this year. Er, Michael . The erm, total figure will end up, it isn't all completely spent yet, but it'll end up er, something between eight and ten million pounds. It's impossible to judge exactly how many people will come in as a result of that and er, how much expenditure will be incurred because as you know we're in a recessionary period and as you've already heard there is concern about current trading, but I would hope that it would bring in er, something like a hundred and fifty thousand extra people, certainly in a good year I'd expect more than that but really that's about as much as I'm prepared to say with some additional spending which will be incurred at Alton Towers. But obviously in a recessionary period, which we are certainly not out of yet, you have to remember that Alton Towers has a per cap of something like fourteen pounds a head at the moment, er, average of all people. And therefore in a recessionary period when pressure is on people spending er, that sort of figure is under tremendous pressure. Erm, a comment on B Sky B and  contribution. I mean, will there be any contribution by way of guar loan guarantees over the forecast, over the next two forecast years or, I mean my understanding was that there was a guarantee fee that, that erm, was still owed this year. B Sky B and its contribution erm, to Pearson. Frank. Well, I mean, we don't, we don't intend to equity account B Sky B for the present time anyway. Er, obviously the guarantee fees are a contractual obligation of B Sky B and er, so we er, we, Pearson are entitled to those and I mean, obviously as, as B Sky B becomes cash generative and erm, then cash will flow into Pearson and I th you know the schedule erm, and in that, in that way. James, would you \\nJames just said that we haven't taken any guarantee fees into this year's profit er, nor any interest on, on loan stocks. That's something that we obviously would consider next, this time next year in the light of, of the performance and prospects and clearly on advice from, from those on the board. But, but as the business continues to do, do better, as they're already doing rather well er, that becomes an issue. Two completely different questions. Can you just tell us what you've done to your entrance pricing for your various entertainment centres and also can you tell us why the Canadian profit's almost doubled in the year? I couldn't hear the second question myself. Your erm, on your allocation of geographical profits er, Canada's profits have almost doubled in the year. Two totally separate questions, the first relating to entrance pricing at our entertainment businesses and we'll deal with that first. Michael. The erm, entrance price increases generally have been in line or slightly above inflation. We normally aim and have achieved very successfully in recent years real price increases above inflation. Last year, you'll remember, we had to absorb, in fact in the Tussauds group, about three quarters of a million er, pounds on the increase in V A T and that was a blow to us at the beginning of the season, you remember it was the budget more or less this time last year. Er, this year hopefully er, with pressure, again as I said earlier but nevertheless we are hoping and having er, put in our new price increases for the season which is more or less beginning now. I hope everybody understands er, Alton Towers is launching its new things today, Chessington opened this weekend, so we haven't been trading until this weekend in effect in our parks business. London, of course, and our Amsterdam exhibition has been trading since the beginning of the year and the price increase is generally coming at the beginning of the season, which is more or less now for the parks, earlier for the exhibitions. And the separate question related to trading profits erm, in Canada. Why have they gone from eight million to fifteen million. Er, James. The er, combination of things. First of all, during the course of the year our holding in the Canadian Financial Post reduced, therefore we took in less losses from that business. Secondly, Penguin Canada returned the profits. Thirdly, both Camco and Addison Wesley had very good years in that territory.\",\n",
       " \"Further questions? Sorry, can I ask another one? Er, on your erm, West Thurrock er, receipt and profits, I think this is the last er, the last year erm, can you give us an indication of er, thought that you might have of filling the hole er, in nineteen ninety three when you cease to ? Er, the major contribution from one transaction in relation to West Thurrock er, which will be coming to an end er, James would you like to comment on that? Well, you're absolutely right, Eric, it does come to an end. Er, to what extent the rift er, filled, I don't think it can be wholly filled as a function of the recovery in er, the market for land. You know we have a considerable holding of er, land immediately adjacent to the reasonable shopping centre there and erm, if and when things become buoyant again and I went down there a couple of weeks and I was rather impressed by, by the look of the area, then clearly land prices go up and we have the capacity to, to generate more profit. But, I think it would be illusory to think that we can maintain our profits from land in ninety three at the same level as it had been for ninety one and two. That was the final question. Well, yes we have a final question. Tony  from . You say if, if all your loans to B Sky B were performing and you consolidated them erm, what your income would be? If we consolidated? If you, if all your loans to B Sky B were performing and you took credit for them what, what would the contribution be? Ah. Er, James. You mean, if we took the interest from Guarantee fees?\",\n",
       " \"Yeah. You got an answer for that? A useful few million. An exciting shot. It's like all good things to come, I don't like to count my chickens, so I'd rather not, not the little memorandums say, oh you've got another X million, if only we could take them in this year.\",\n",
       " \"Any of my colleagues have a number in their mind? . Fifteen. Thanks Charles. Er, we have another question. What criteria, I mean, will you use to determine whether or not you actually erm, take those into account in determining nineteen ninety two's figures? Whether and when they're gonna be paid. String that to whether, James. When James, not whether. Well, I regard the answer to whether as academic. So, on happy, on that happy note could we go next door and have some coffee. Erm John\\nand Jonathan sit down but when I\\nI want you to read your essay about your home.

When I was walking past the marsh one, one night, when I was on my way back from school I heard a rus rustling noise behind a bu bush, when I went up the, went up first to the bush a big dragon-like thing jumped out from behind the bush, it gave me such a fright I nearly fainted. I started to run up, straight up the hill, erm lucky the monster was running straight at me and  sticking out of the crowd and he tripped over and after  the end  \\nMy home.

Inside our home we have a lot of furniture, we have four rooms, one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom and one in the lounge  and one in the kitchen   \\nRight then. I like erm, Christopher  and Simon\\nyes I know, take your books and show\\nright, erm, Jonathan here\\nright John has written a story about his home  right it's a good descriptive story on how people live\\nuntil one day they couldn't think of any way that you could may improve it.

Secondly, the re-election of directors retiring  er, and thirdly  the appointment of the audit auditors and their remuneration. The A G M will be followed, er, directly after this meeting, er, by an extraordinary general meeting  erm  to propose, er, an increase in the authorized share capital  to seek authority to create new preference share capital  to renew the board's power to allot shares  to  seek authority to purchase our own shares  to reduce share capital by repaying existing preference shares  to make some amendments to the employee share schemes  to increase the  aggregate amount available for directors' fees and to enable the company to issue summary financial statements. I'll now call upon David  of Coopers and Lybrand to read the report of the auditors to the members. Thank you David. Erm  next, er  I shall be proposing a resolution to receive the report and accounts and to declare a dividend. Then  before putting the resolution to the vote  I shall say a few words and ask whether, ah, there are any questions. The report and accounts have been in your hands for the statutory period  er, and you've had the chance to read my statement. I therefore propose that the report of the directors and the audited accounts for the year ended thirty first December nineteen eighty nine now submitted to this meeting  be and are hereby  er, received and that the final dividend of twelve point five pence, er, net per share, recommended by the directors  be and is hereby declared payable on first June nineteen ninety, to holders of ordinary shares of the company on the register, three P M  on fourth of May nineteen ninety. We are entering the nineteen nineties as a well-defined  well-balanced company  both in the spread of our businesses and the geographical spread of our markets. We now generate sixty five percent of our sales outside the United Kingdom. We had another excellent year in nineteen eighty nine  with a twenty percent increase in earnings per share and a nineteen percent increase in dividends per share. Since eighty two  er, when we merged the two Pearson public companies  we have increased Pearson's earnings per share and dividends four-fold. We have achieved this by selling top quality products and services expertly and aggressively in the international marketplace  by acquiring businesses which complement and support our four chosen areas of operation  and by disposing of businesses which had no obvious place in those areas. I explained in my statement in the annual report about the management reorganisation which occurred at the end of nineteen eighty nine. Although Frank  has been a director of Pearson since nineteen eighty six and those of you been to this meeting in the last few years will have seen him before  I'd like to introduce, ah, Frank to you in his new capacity  Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer at Pearson. Frank, will you take a bow. Erm, many of you will also have seen Jean-Claude  at previous meetings  which he attended in the capacity as  to Michel . I'd like to welcome Jean-Claude to this his first A G M as a full member of the board. Er, now to move on to events that have happened since the, er, annual report was printed  many of you will no doubt have seen in the press that the same time as we announced our results at the end of March that we agreed to buy, er, the Alton Towers theme park  er, in Staffordshire, from John , for sixty million pounds  er, the purchase has now been completed. Erm, Alton Towers is a really marvellous addition to the  Group  er, which intends to develop the business further both by attracting more visitors  er, with new and exciting rides and also, er, by, through their unique knack of increasing visitor spending levels. Er, we also announced at the same time as the Alton, er, Towers acquisition that Longman had acquired Rank Training for eleven and a half million pounds. Er, this company has a leading position, er, in the fast expanding field of video training products for the corporate market  and that's an area which Longman has identified, er, as a new area for expansion. Longman is already one of the U K's leading providers of business education  materials and will use this base to develop and expand the Rank Training business. If the early nineteen nineties are as testing a time for U S and U K markets as many people predict  I'm nonetheless confident that Pearson is better placed than most companies to withstand this. In the first quarter of this year  we've seen more moderate growth in those geographical areas  but in nineteen eighty nine nearly forty percent of Pearson's trading ca profit  came from economies outside the U K and North America  and we expect our activities in these other areas to continue to grow at a satisfactory rate. Well, I think that concludes, er, the, er er, remarks that I'd like to, er, make. I've already put the, er, resolution to the shareholders but, erm  er, before voting on it I'd be pleased to answer any questions. And could you, could you say  your name  and \\nMy name is Mr , I am an ordinary shareholder of some years' standing. I welcome your speech because you have a quite a good habit of  optimistic outlook  future which is contrary to what a lot of other chairmen are saying. it does, it does the company very very  no chance in the following year  share prices have dropped enormously. I noted you  that the company bought Alton Towers. Now I'm not  I'm asking is whether its shareholders could write in to apply for a concessionary ticket to Alton Towers and  get a reduced price if they so wish. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr . Er  er, I've, er I just  I'm just saying that, er, that, that last year  er, when I made a few remarks  that they were misquoted by Reuters and we did leave the meeting and the share price dropped by  er, several P  and we had to send out a correcting statement so this year we've taken the precaution of issuing a press release  er, at the same time as er, er, I'm making these remarks so I hope at least they won't be misinterpreted. Erm  as to I think I heard you say  er, ask about concessionary prices to Alton  Towers, was that correct? Ya. Well  er  we, we've taken a, a, a policy view over the years because the group has a number of er very attractive er products and, and, and, and shareholders have frequently asked if was possible  erm, to have concessions in all sorts of areas and the view we've taken  is that  it involves a, a, a, a, a great deal of administration  and that our real job is to  er  increase the profits of the business  er,a as well as we can and then to pay dividends to the shareholders  erm  who will  er, er, then use that money  er, hopefully to buy a good number of our products. Yes sir. Good morning. My name is   and, er  it appears to me, sir  that you like to make life difficult for the managers to negotiate wage settlements with the employees of the company  I note that your salary has increased by more than fifty percent  in one year. That I don't think will please John Major or Mrs Thatcher  for being, er  seeing you fuelling and other directors and all the directors of our public companies  fuelling inflation with their inflationary wage rises  doesn't seem reasonable whatsoever  and I think that er  one should consider this in a different light. Thank you for  er, question. There's been quite a lot of comment in the press  erm, on high levels of, of salary  of, of remu remuneration for directors and I think it might be helpful  er, if I was  were t were, were to make some general remarks on the background  er, of how we  er, approach directors' remuneration. On the question of my own  er  er, er, position  I think I would ask, er, in a minute to have Sir Simon  to say something  because er, er, er, I don't, I  I, you know, I don't set my own remuneration. Er, and  in general we have a, er, panel of the non-executive directors who set the directors' salary  in relation to the other directors I am also on that panel  er, but obviously not in relation to my own salary. Erm  we have, er, access to the advice of professional advisers, namely  and Co  our policy is to keep base salaries at the mid-point of market competitive range  erm, and provide bonus opportunities that can lift total take home pay into the upper quartile. Erm  the bonus element of the Pearson scheme is highly leveraged  we are very keen to achieve above-average performance for our shareholders  and let me give you an example, if in nineteen ninety  erm  Pearsons as a company achieved say five percent  growth in earnings per share  erm  the directors' remuneration, and by the way that's not a forecast so I want to make that absolutely clear, it's just an illustration  if earnings per share increase by five percent and you could say, er, therefore we would expect directors' remuneration to be perhaps increased by five percent  that wouldn't be the case at all  our directors' salaries would actually halve  erm, Ill say that again, directors' total take home pay would halve because the salary element wouldn't, wouldn't alter. Erm  so  er  i i i er, I think that erm, er er er y you'll see that erm th th the the situation isn't, erm, er, perhaps quite as simple a a as you might, erm  as you might think  erm  and, er, next year if that happened  er, perhaps there'd be headlines saying Pearson directors  er, half their remuneration. Erm  and the reason we set this is that we are  erm  er  the  er, er  we believe that this above average er growth in the  in the, erm, er, earnings per share of the company is what shareh increases in shareholder value really depend on  and  er  again to give an example  erm, if you take the, the, the, the, the, the F T S E a hundred companies  erm, and you do analyses of their  er, growth rates and earnings per share you will find that the average growth rate was eleven and a half percent  and ours  er, was  er, twenty, twenty percent  so it's above average remuneration  erm, er, er, for above av for above average performance. And I don't think I can say much more than that but perhaps Simon\\nI hardly feel, sir, that erm  erm  you don't have some influence on your salaries and the other directors' salaries, I've heard a lot of directors and chairmen say that they have no influence on their own salaries. This doesn't cut any ice with me because I believe that  none of these directors would be in on the board if they weren't invited there by yourself. So  erm \\nErm  well, I, I, I beg to correct you. Er  these directors are the bosses of international, erm, companies themselves. They have no, they have no personal, erm, relationship with me  er, I'll give you the example of one of our, erm  er, er  er  erm, er  most recent directors who's, who's just joined the board, Mr Ruben , who's the head of Colgate Palmo Palmolive, and I just described to him  to you how we, erm  how  we, er er er er er selected him. We went to, er, we felt that we needed, er, a U S director because much of our business is in the U S  with wide marketing experience  we went to, erm, headhunters  er, in America  who drew up  er, a list of sixty people, culled from their own research  erm  we narrowed that down as an executive to twelve. We presented these twelve names, er, to the board of Pearsons  erm, the board selected three  er, we kept one in reserve and I was sent out to America by the board to see, er, the two, er, leading candidates. Erm, I met Mr  for the first time in the airport lounge at, erm  er, er, Kennedy Airport  erm, we discussed at great length and had a very interesting discussion  erm, er, Pearsons  erm, he accepted  er, the job  and h I, he has no obligation to me whatsoever  and he is one of the  er, members of the  er, remuneration committee, and I actually take offence at what you're saying. Simon \\nI'm very sorry you take offence, sir. no offence meant and I  I really hope that you do not take offence in that way. Erm \\nThis may be out of order but, er, personal experience is that  the, er, non-executive directors who were involved in the compensation  made a recommendation that, er  Michael  's salary be higher  erm, than he in fact a agreed with, he requested that we lower it  and in fact that was what was done. Well, I do hope that our public companies take into consideration inflation in the future. Er, thank you very much. I'm very \\nLadies \\nsorry, sir, that if you took offence at anything I said. There was no offence meant. Thank you. La ladies and gentlemen \\nLord  has asked me to say a few words about erm  er, directors' salaries and particularly about his own. Now I don't stand here in any sense of defending these salaries, in fact I think our policy is entirely right  and it is not inflationary. Ergo, we have to look, I think, at the record of this company over the last few years and as the chairman said in his introductory remarks  the growth in the company, the growth in the earnings per share, has been very remarkable. The, er, credit to that goes to the chairman and chief executive  and the executive directors  and they are responsible for the business  and it is right, in my view, that they should be rewarded for it and encouraged to take risks  to work very hard on our behalf  to ensure that that growth continues  er, er, that benefits the, er, company, it benefits the country  it benefits the  er  ergo, people who are working for it, it is not inflationary because we are looking at productivity and the productivity in the company has increased significantly. Now, as the chairman said  we base the salaries of directors on two elements  an element of base salary which looks at market levels and we  ergo, have a fair base which reflects a sort of medium to upper level of companies of this size  we then leverage, very carefully, a bonus scheme related to performance  and I believe that is the right thing to do and I believe and so do my fellow directors who sit on that committee  believe that it is one of the reasons that we've seen the great growth in this company over the last five years which you've achieved  and which actually the Chancellor of the Exchequer would very glad about because it is increasing the wealth and the benefit of this country, particularly as a lot of those earnings are coming from overseas  and will in, in time be repatriated in Britain. So I believe we're doing the right thing, I think it's for the good of the country  I think it's for the good of the company and the shareholders. I'd just like to add  er, that I didn't take offence at the question, I think it was a perfectly qu fair question, it was the, the inference of, of rigging salaries. Er  right, could we go on to perhaps a less emotive issue. Er, my name's John . Could I make a constructive suggestion  in this context of board salaries or remunerations  or compensation packages  or bonuses  I'm saying that in a slightly tongue in cheek way because I believe that the majority of shareholders don't understand the differences between these concepts, as you gentlemen evidently do. Most ordinary shareholders have never  had a total remuneration package and have never been part of a  performance-related bonus scheme. Would you be prepared, er  chairman and gentlemen  to consider Pearson giving a lead in spelling out, in the next annual report  the precise relationship between the bonus element  and  some parameter which I gather from your earlier remarks is probably earnings per share. I think this might help to  defuse the whole situation which is getting a little bit hot, I've been \\nto a lot of A G Ms recently and this topic is coming up at most and one feels that it almost may become an issue at the next general election. W would you be prepared to consider this at another, at, at a future board meeting? I think that's a very constructive suggestion and we'll certainly  er, consider it  er, in drawing up the  er, annual report and accounts next year. Yes, lady at the back. Erm  er, my name's , an ordinary shareholder for long-standing  erm, it would be very interesting, I don't know whether this is possible now or maybe following on from what the speaker has said, if we had some idea of the American system which is  er, I only know very little about it  er  I, just how that works because we have presidents and vice presidents and, er  I think it work rather differently. So  it would be rather interesting if we could have some sort of comparison. Would one of our American directors  like to  \\nI would have to confess that by American standards the er  er  the, er, directors of Pearson, the executive directors of Pearson and  er, the chairman of Pearson and I think that the directors of most English companies are significantly underpaid by U S standards  that's not to say it's right but, er, that seems to be the, er  ha  the current trend. Actually, I, I didn't mean that, er  regarding the actual amounts because I'm fully aware of the fact that the American ones are very much higher, it's merely the method by which they are  erm   \\nMy own feeling is that there is a great similarity and that there is a  a base salary normally which is  set on a competitive level with a target as in this case  perhaps at the mid-point, perhaps at the sixty percent  level or whatever it would be  and that a significant uplift in compensation can be obtained by a bonus scheme, if the performance of the company as measured in earnings per share, return on capital, return on equity or any m other measure  if those objectives are met. So I think that th the scheme that  erm  Pearson uses is  er, not at all dissimilar to what would be a fairly standard practice in the United States. and people like that, but  er, I believe that the, the way it's actually organized is different. It, again I have to, I have to say \\nthat  talk about the company of which I'm chairman  is that there is a  personnel and compensation committee  which in the absence of a chief executive  sets the chief executive's remuneration and with the presence of the chief executive, although he's not, I'm not a member of that committee  we work on the other senior executives of the company, it's quite similar to the process used here in your company. Yes sir. My name is   I have been a shareholder and other members of my family for many years  much has already been said about directors' and your particular  erm, fees in particular. But er it, it, it er it appears to have been overlooked that, erm  some of the directors who were in the bracket in nineteen eighty eight of two hundred and thirty thousand to two ninety five thousand  have been increased from three hundred and fifty five thousand this year to a top of four hundred thousand. Er, you have also erm mentioned about the bonus  er, can I take it from what you have said that this is profit-related? If not  I suggest it should be  and, er, therefore if unfortunately the profits of the company did go down in the foreseeable future  the salaries of yourself and your directors would be reduced. As regards the salaries of the U S A  we've read and seen about so many companies that pay sky-high for v various salaries and other schemes, we don't want that in this country  but we do want a degree of evenness and I would repeat as somebody has already said, that your salary has gone up fifty six percent  which is very, very high. Now there was one other thing if you would care to take it  is that you said that it would involve a great deal of organization for concessionary tickets  for Alton Towers or Tussauds  or any others. Erm  Ready Mix have a theme park  in Th Thorpe Park and there's no problem there of issuing tickets to shareholders for  erm, entertainment of their, their families. They d don't make so much fuss about it  they distribute it  and it gets on very satisfactory and people  er, are very happy to receive these tickets. I think the question of turning it down, that a lot of work is  er, forgive my bluntness  nonsense. Er  one other thing is the  the share capital is sixty five billion pounds. It's true that we had a  issue  erm  nineteen eighty five  but the reserves are now six hundred and fifty million. Whether you have given this the same consideration of the increase in, er, directors' salaries  I don't know, but I think y it's worthy of, er, a further consideration. Er  one last thing  er, do we need so many as eight non-executive directors  which also to be paid? You've got five executive directors  I should think that's adequate with one or two outside directors to  bring outside knowledge or experience  but, er  thirteen is too many I suggest. Er  well there are a number of, of points there and I'll, I'll try and cover them all. The first you asked again about, er, directors' salaries  er, or directors' er  er  remuneration  erm, and I would only say that all the directors are  er  bonuses are linked to earnings per share. Er, I hoped I'd made clear that if the profits of Pearsons  erm  er not only if they went down  but even if er, there was only a small  erm, increase in earnings per share  er  next year  that the  the directors' salaries would be very considerably reduced  and I thought I'd already made that  erm, er, directors' erm remuneration total take home pay would be considerably reduced  thought I'd already made that point. Erm  on  er, Alton Towers which you brought up again  er  the question is where do you stop? Er, it isn't just Alton Towers, it's whether you should get discounts on Penguin Books  it was whether you got, er, bottles of Chateau le Tour  erm  it, it  requests for many different things  and, er,you know, alright  er, it  we could, we could, if Alton Towers seemed to be what, er, all shareholders wanted  er, perhaps we, we could consider that  but, but, but we do have a number of a attractive products. Erm  er  your third point was about the balance sheet and I think I'd ask the finance director \\nYes  we, we will give consideration to that of course erm \\nSorry, can I\\nApologies. Erm  we will, course we will give consideration to erm  a further  issue which I think is what you were asking us to do. All that does, in effect, as you know is  i i is reduce the unit price  share price, it has no other  effect  erm  a and I think it's purely cosmetic myself and nowadays I think a share price of around seven hundred P which is, er  where the shares are currently hovering, is not  e enormously disproportionate  but of course we'll keep it under consideration. Erm  and your last point was about, erm, er  the number of directors and particularly  er, outside directors, non-executive directors. Well all I can say is that, erm  Sir Simon was being extremely modest when he said that the development of this company  er, has been due  er, entirely to the executive directors. That  that isn't actually the case  erm  the non-executive directors have been enormously helpful in, er, the field of strategy  in giving the executive advice  er  they play a very full  er, role in the develop er m development of the company  and erm  they also  er, keep the er executives, er, in order. Who would sack me? Ch chairman, I wonder if I may just add to that \\nI'm sure you know that  the Bank of England  the Bank of England have made a very strong point that on balance there should be more non-executive directors than executive directors in the company  and, er  it is felt very strongly that  to get a good mix of non-executive directors really does protect the shareholders' interests  and, er  I think we're very much following the lead, er, of the Bank of, of England, erm, in this particular respect. And I think that we are very lucky in the very high calibre of non-executive directors we've been able to attract. Name, sir. On Saturday afternoon last \\nWhat?\",\n",
       " \"Your name! Oh sorry. , same as jam! Er, it's very difficult, yes you all laughed when I asked a question last year from over there to get a capital P in Pearson  because you all laughed  it took twenty weeks to get it  in The Times, do you remember? Right. Now we've got a company secretary  he is  er, an F C I S  Chartered Institute Secretaries  that's much better than a chartered accountant, they're no damn good as secretaries, right! And the \\nL L B people  really they're not up to much, are they? Now this chap is supposed to have constructive commonsense  forensic ability, what do we mean,the police? Affability  to laugh off his twenty week delay in getting my capital P! Right. Now can we look at his pay  cos you all been busy on the directors' pay and this chartered secretary is really important  and so that he could be available on a Saturday afternoon if he was wanted. Well now, the problem  you say it's emotional  shall I say it was blasphemous, it was Rushdie. Now, erm, the situation there was  that my vicar came to see me  and, erm, what happened was that we've got three churches  well luckily, one of them  only has about twelve in it  another has eighty and another sixty  and he said  well what did he do about Rushdie? And so  well I didn't like what he was doing  but at any rate it happened on Sunday morning  er, somebody read the lesson  and it was Saint, Saint John and there were chapters  and of course it was skipping about the verses all over the place, you just got fed up with verses. Right  he then went to the pulpit  and he said  that he was gonna preach about Lazarus actually  but  he's a quiet fellow and he shouted at the top of his voice  I'm speaking about satanic bondage! Er, Mr  \\nYes, is \\ner \\nthat blasphemous? er,n what, what, er, er, I think you need to do is ask your question because  er \\nOh right \\nto have a narratable speech is not in order \\nI'm so sorry. yes, yes  right. Is  erm  do we know anything about Rushdie or anything? Another point is, up in Hull in October  er, somebody wrote a book about Mahatma Ghandi  and he got death threats  so the vice chancellor of Hull University  he's in Fenners he's a director of J H Fenners in industrial. So I suggest the secretary rings up the secretary of Fenners don't say you're listed in newspapers cos industrial people don't like that  but have a word with Fenners and they'll tell you what's gone on. So, what is your question? The question is can a small shareholder do anything for Rushdie, am I doing damage for Pearson? I'm trying \\nMm. to help Pearson \\nMm. not pick it to bits over its directors' salaries. Er, well  thank you for your offer of help  it is, er  i i i i it's er  er clearly a very difficult issue, there are  erm, there are important issues of principle  er, in, er  conflicting directions  it is not an easy one  and erm  er er er I don't  er, really know that there is anything  er  that, er  any shareholder of Pearsons is able to do about it.\",\n",

I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour  any against  thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Erm  we now come to the appointment of the auditors and the question of their remuneration. Under the provisions of the Companies Act Nineteen Eighty Five  their appointment  er, requires the annual approval of the shareholders. I therefore propose that Coopers and Lybrand  be and are hereby appointed auditors to the company, to hold office from the conclusion of this meeting until the conclusion of the next meeting  er, of the company  at which accounts are laid for the company in accordance with section two four one  Companies Act Nineteen Eighty Five  and that their remuneration for this period be fixed by the directors. I put the resolution to the meeting. Those in favour  any against? Thank you. I declare the resolution carried. Well, that concludes the business of the A G M  and, er  it's now twelve forty  and  er  we can move straight on to deal with the business of the extraordinary general meeting. Erm  you already had, er, the opportunity to read my letter of the eighteenth of April  er, circulated with the report and accounts, which fully explains the proposals being put forward and which are for firstly increasing the authorized share capital of the company  creating two new classes of preference share  er, renewing the board's authority to allot shares  renewing the board's power to modify preemption rights  authorizing the company to purchase its own  er, ordinary shares  reducing the company's share capital by repaying the existing preference shares  er, making certain amendments to the company's employee share schemes  increasing the aggregate sum available for directors' fees  and authorizing the company to issue summary financial statements. Erm  I  hope that the, er, circular  er  pretty fully explains  er, these proposals  but, er  if there are  er, questions  er, I would be very pleased to answer them. Well, if there aren't any questions  er, I would return to the resolutions, er, separately  and I would propose the first one which is an ordinary resolution  namely it's resolution one, set out in the notice of meeting  to increase the authorized share capital of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting  those in favour  any against? I declare the resolution carried, it's an ordinary resolution. Erm  secondly  I propose a special resolution, resolution two, set out in the notice of the meeting  to create and allot fifty thousand preference shares of U S dollars, a hundred  er, each  and a hundred billion  er, preference shares of one pound each  er, I put the resolution to the meeting  those in favour  any against? I declare the  er, er  special resolution  er, carried. Erm  I propose that ordinary resolution, resolution three set out in the notice of the meeting  to grant authority to the board to exercise the powers of the company to allot ordinary shares  er, this is an annual  er, event  I put the resolution to the meeting, those in favour  any against? I declare the, er, resolution carried as an ordinary resolution. Erm   next I propose as a, er, resolution four which is a special resolution  and s set out in the notice of the meeting and is  to modify  to a limited extent, the obligations relating to the allotment of shares for cash  contained in section eighty nine of the Companies Act. Er  I put the resolution to the meeting, those in favour  any against? I declare the resolution carried as a special resolution. Next resolution five which is an ordinary resolution  er, set ou set out in the notice of the meeting  which is to authorize the company to make market purchases of the ordinary shares of the company. This again is an annual. I put the resolution to the meeting  those in favour  any against  I declare the resolution, er, carried  er,as an ordinary resolution. Er  resolution six  is a special resolution set out in the notice of the meeting and is to reduce the company's share capital by   repaying the five  erm  hundred and one thousand, three and a half percent cumulative preference shares of one pound, er, each at par. I put the resolution to the meeting  those in favour  \\nS I  well I asked for questions before, Mr , but erm  what is your question? Why is there a need, sir, to repay the five hundred and one thousand pounds of the three and a half percent cumulative pref shares  it's  quite a low interest involved. What  a low interest share? Well this gives us the ability  er, for a tidying up operation but the finance director will give more details. Thank you very much. It's helpful in the context of the  dollar preference shares we want to issue  because one of the factors of this very small, and as you say cheap  er, historic issue of preference shares is that, er  no preference shares other than those can be repaid prior to that  and the dollar shares we wish to issue which are permanent shares, can be  er, can be erm  repaid at our option and we do want to keep that flexibility in the context of either if interest rates get very high or if the tax treaty between the U S and the U K changes to make them more onerous on the company  and in those circumstances we would be inhibited by the existence of this small historic issue of preference shares  and therefore  it is on balance, although you're quite right there, a cheap  er, source of capital in themselves  it is helpful to the company in the wider sense I believe  if they are repaid. I put the resolution to the meeting  those in favour  any against  declare the resolution  er, carried as a special resolution. Er, next is resolution seven which is an ordinary resolution set out in the notice of the meeting, and it is to authorize the directors to amend the company's employee share schemes in the manner set out in the circular dated eighteenth of April nineteen ninety  to members of the company. I put the resolution to the meeting  those in favour  any against  I declare the resolution carried as an ordinary resolution. Erm  resolution eight  er, set out in the notice of the meeting  to increase the aggregate annual sum available for directors' fees to two hundred and fifty thousand pounds  I put the resolution to the meeting  those in favour  any against  I declare the resolution carried as an ordinary re resolution. Erm  finally, resolution nine which is a special resolution set out in the notice of the meeting  er, and it's to alter the company's articles to enable the company to issue summary financial statements. I put the resolution to the meeting  those in favour  any against  thank you very much, I declare the resolution carried as a special reso resolution.

We're, we're going to conclude now the discussion of the various ways in which, bacteria, in particular er  lead to the production of infective disease  and really to centre round, centres round the discussion of the pathogenesis, that is the mechanism by which the disease is produced  and lunanspach. And I hope to run through today, basically, a set of examples of specific infective positions which show particular virulence factors  er manifest themselves in terms of clinical disease. We start with er er  a fine and exciting topic for Monday morning  the topic of boils and in their finalist form  they're shown here as starike. But, the sa the very same organisms responsible for that relatively moderate appearance can also produce blocked er  region of Prince Charles, the carbuncle with which in it's most er  florid form can break down and produce the series, but really effectively interconnecting . If we  sample one of these cavities in which the process is er  which produce boils er  are going on, almost inevitably we find this organism staphylococcusorius  and offspotulates have been clearly fulfilled with organism and this disease  most notably by a bunch of of medical students who are subjected to all sorts of tortures by their professor of microbiology back in the nineteen fifties. And over the years it's been possible  to identify a number of factors produced by these bacteria that seem to make sense in terms of the pathology and the conditions. Now the pathology is  by  a chief information  and i in fact, the chief information could be provoked merely by the presence of organisms. You will, you will recognise  from your immunology  that the presence is certainly foreign  antigenic materials  can lead  immediately to, to the acute alternatives. But, notable inside  er  the  material  that characterises the boils and abscesses, there is a cell death, both of bacteria and of the  both the defending cells and the structural cells. And, to a very large extent tri cell death can be related to the ability  of staph orius to produce elicit toxins, toxins which actually leave the cell death and . But the characteristic of this puss forming organism is that the legions it produces are wooled off, that is they're relatively localized. And  although the er, the causal relationship is not completely established, it is a very helpful way of remembering that one of the  principle distinguishing features of this organism which separates it from other members of the genus staphylococcus  it pr it produces this enzyme to coagulate things on  and the effects of this enzyme are illustrated here as against the control preparation, you see  a clot form due to the action of this enzyme on clotting practice which has been put into this  test tube serum. So this is almost certain a virulence factor but is also very useful in differentiating  pathogenic species of staphylococci from non-pathogenic species. And, as as you'll be hearing in later  er stages of the course  there are many non-pathogenic species  of staphylococci. It's worth also mentioning, since you saw it in the practical class, that staphylococci in general produce this enzyme catalase  all of these er lo thi this is the enzyme which breaks down hydrogen peroxide and detoxifies it. All of these factors together  lead us an to recognise as it a puss forming organism  which  is often recognised by the term hyogenic organism, ability to produce puss in er the form of reactions  it initiates. Now I want  at least, to intro introduce the possibility in the series of diagrams I'm going to show you in this lecture  that we can relate it to the four stages  of pathogenesis that we, we outline briefly  er, in the last lecture. The first stage being the establishment, the next stage being penetration, the third stage being damage, what actually produces the damage in the disease, and the fourth stage is, if the disease is going to last for any period of time  the ability of the organism to persist. I'm going to introduce this  abbreviated momentictiture here in the hope that during the course of the lecture I'll be able to add  comments about which of these factors lead to which of these results. Er, but if we run out of time and I find we haven't we we we can't fit it all in I'd like you all to attempt  to do this for yourselves after er, the lecture is over. Okay? So, establishment for staphylococcusorius is often not an important feature because  in the majority of infections we're talking about an endogenous infection, the organism was there in the first place. Penetration  in many instances is not related to a property of the organism itself, in most instances it's re related to  some form of injury in which the organism is moved from it's normal skin location to a deep tissue location. So we won't mention these factors here, although  in  in some instances  er, these  properties are important to talk about for staph orius. The damage, is fairly obvious to see is produced by  these two  and it's worth pointing out that persistence  can be related to this catalase enzyme. Staphylococci have some degree of resistance to killing by phagocytes and yo you should recall that phagocytes  er, one of the mechanisms by which phagocytes kill intercellular organisms is the production of reactive oxygen intermediates  and catalase is one of the ways that these can  detoxified  and th there's  fairly good evidence that the catalase enzyme enables  er,staph orius to persist. Okay. So, that's, that's the first example of a very common condition. Let's move on now to consider a very important  type of infection  such as meningitis. You recognise by  particularly common in children not recognised by the particular posture that they adopt and extended neck, rigid neck due to the inflammation of le , lymphees  which I will resist being a reflection of the neck, completely rigidly. It's a disease which, if it a , they're fortunate enough to re , recover from the disease, if it's been severe enough the inflammation may have  involved  er, some of the cranial nerves, and here we can see a third nerve palsy er as a result of  er, the  process. If you take a sample  er, of ce the cera cereblis  fluid  during the course of acute bacteria meningitis you will find it's drowning, drowning, not due the fact that it's an organism, but present, being due to the presence of  puss cells. This is another biogenical fluid  and, in about a third of the cases you will find  this, very faintly  with them\\nMm mm. which you can just about see here  a in conjunction with the puss cells with which it is  busily  \\nthe life and death, life and death  tackle. This organism  is the fastidious grand negative  rod you saw in the erm  practical class  innocuous influenzi. And it is a  a very important pathogen responsible for about a third of the cases of meningitis in in this country  almost exclusively in children. Now, the process we recognise  in the pa pathogenesis  of meningitis due to this organism  is as follows, first of all    and then it is able, by, mechanisms not completely described but  we could probably involve this transpschycosis er phenomenon that er, I I briefly mentioned last time. First of all, penetrates from the  into the bloodstream and then  into the cerebral spinal fluid. Now  the basis for the pathogenesis is not well enough established for us to expect you to understand  the details of how it achieves these processes, but one thing which is  remarkably clear  is that the organism  is a capsule producing organism  and that once it gets into the er  cerebral spinal fluid that predominately  is an acute inflammatory . We do recognise establishment factors, that is  adhesions  in this part of the process  and it is very clear that the capsule  is one of the factors which allows the organism to pe , persist because it helps the organism to resist phagocytosis. You'll notice that the damage in this instance is actually the result of the acute inflammatory response, not particularly some form of direct noxious effect  of the organism, so  the contribution of the host is absolutely critical. Now, the reason we  we focus on the capsule as illustrated on the right here  is  that  hymophylus   have many different capsular types, but but only one type appears to be associated with meningitis. This type B capsule refers to a particular pulse  \\nand  has  it's so important in the pathogenesis of the  capsule that antibodies to it  can be used er,ca , er can actually completely prevent the disease  and we end up with a capsule vaccine based on the type B pulse . Plus, referencing with the other two organisms which produce  meningitis in, in humans  it is very prominent that both of these, licea meninigitipitus  and staphylococcus  are also very prominent capsule mechanisms.\",\n",
       " \"Hello! That's like the  type. H I for hymopholus  influenzi. And that's, that H I is actually the  th th H, H I B is the acronym for the vaccine. There's a new vaccine introduced last October  which is being er, used for the first time in this country to prevent meningitis in children. Is that just the name of the vaccine? H, well H I B is a, an abbreviation for the strain of hymopholus that produces the infection, but the name of the vaccine the H I B vaccine, yeah. Okay? I should say that a, a lot of this information will be covered again  during this course, what I'm trying to do now is to bring together  the  the themes in a pathogenesis of infection that I introduced last week into the practical context of clinical infections. And to to, to try and illustrate to you why we focus on particular virulence factors for particular organisms. Move on now to  to look at  an area that's er  not frequently  er  doesn't impinge a great deal on life in this country but it certainly does for travellers  and for many people in the developing world. This is the topic of secretory diarrhoea  produced by infective agents. This is a dramatic disorder of the small intestine which produces a massive outflow of water electrolytes that can be fatal within a matter of hours after the onset of disease! We recognise  two agents  which are er, responsible in bacterial causes of this process,th there are many others but these are certainly the most important. choleri, the cholera vacilus  and  er, an acronym here, ETEC, I wouldn't worry about  taking down the full er, er  , it actually stands for e entrotoxigenic ecolytes, it's a strain or a group of ecolars  that are able to produce this effect. These diseases are common in areas er where an out pouring of water from the individual is squared up with a ou , out pouring of people into the water, then you can appreciate that that transmission  is very er, readily promoted under those circumstances. The effects on the, the individual are very dramatic! Dehydration, er can  produce death within a matter of fe , er a few hours and  and an understanding of the mechanism by which this dehydration   leads us into  one of the most effective forms of heat treatment er, ever produced. A prominent feature of secretory diarrhoea is that  effective and normal bowel  in,yo you ca , you can ignore this  sign  are almost indistinguishable, so despite this dramatic change in the physiology of the small bowel, borthalogically it actually looks quite normal. And you have a normal meconium. Now, the organisms that produce  this effect haven't, have  this target which is around zero for the  choleri , the villi of a small intestine  and  the  both of these organisms have  pro prominent adhesion mechanisms. Let's just show you something with that. In an affected small bowel  you will see  the grey background with these tiny little curved  rods present  the whole area of the er, the villi is covered by the organisms which are er  stuck down effectively by the processes which you ca , you can't really see them in the transmission  micrograph, but they are attached to specific receptors on the surface of the entrocite membrane. Once they've got there, the organism  really goes no further. Both  the cholera organism  and the ETEC organism  secrete toxins  referred to here as C T for cholera toxin and LT for the le Lethane toxin. It is  very striking that these toxins are actually almost exactly the same molecule! So that although these are  er  fairly different relatives in terms of bacteria   it's striking that the ETEC organism has been able to acquire in some way almost exactly the same gene that's present in  choleri. And, this toxin when released from these tightly  organisms  disorders the er  the physiological activity of the lining cells, the empha cells. The molecular  oh we've lost a slide! The molecular basis for this is very well understood and  forms one of the important themes in  er  the effects of e , exotoxin in human cells. This toxin is composed of two components er, of binding components and  active component. Binding component binds to specific receptors on the emphacyte and the active component penetrates into the cell and  inactivates the controlling mechanism on the production of . And this is the  cell that er, is possessed by several other toxins that affect, not just the gut but other parts of the body as well. I should point out that in  one of the features of adhesions is that it takes two to tango, so to speak! Where specific adhesions are involved  the  the , the structures that are, are most commonly associated with a , require a specific receptor  for the adhesion reaction to take place  and that if  the potential host doesn't have specific receptor  they're not susceptible to that particular strain of organisms. Okay. Let's move on to look at another  fairly dramatic infection  which is a case of diphtheria. That, which is er  a  infection ca characterized by this  profuse athema of th the  base of the neck, referred to as bull neck  if you look inside this child's er pharynx you see this very messy  inflammatory process at the back and the whole of the respiratory mucosa is beginning to detach in what's referred to as a pseudo-membrane. In, fatal cases this pseudo- membrane can extend right from the top of the respiratory track here down into bronchi, and you can get these enormous casts of mucrotic material  er, starting in the pharynx and working their way right down in the bronchi. It's been known for a very long time that from these cases you can isolate this organism C diphtheria  bacterium    which you saw in the practical classes and has this distinctive stayed property where er certain granules can be stayed up and also the arrangement of the cells is rather reminiscent of what called Chinese lettering. The picture, the acute picture which you've just seen is  virtually exclusively due to the production of a toxin  and that toxin produces really  a necrotic pharyngitis  inflammation of the pharynx  associated with necrosis and detachment  of what we call the pseudo-membrane. In  very severe cases  the toxin gets into the blood stream and their paralytic effects  toxin i i is to some extent a neuro-toxin, and also there are effects of the heart. So  although  for the majority of cases  that a fatal  as a result of diphtheria  the fact that , due actually to the pharyngitis and the pseudo- membrane obstructing the respiratory passage. In later stages, the minority of cases may go on to produce these results. Well this is a disease due to another exotoxin  which, in practical terms is of importance to you because it's the basis for a test for identifying the . The toxin  may or may not be present in strains of  er  C diphtheria  and this is  just an immunological test so I wo won't explain it in detail but what you can see is a  a strip of er, filter paper which has been bathed in anti-toxin and  growth of various different strains of the organism  erm  which, some of which do produce the toxin  you can see lines of precipitation here  and some of which don't produce the toxin. And that test  has to be applied to es each eyslate  because  this toxin is not part of the genome of  Cherani bacteria diphtheria, it's actually a farged mediated toxin, it's actually encoded for by a bacteria farged. So when \\nWhat's paresis then? Paresis, paralysis.\",\n",
       " \"Oh! I thought you were doing neuro-sciences course? The  as I said this, this is required for identification for the organism, but  the to the toxin has been  recognised for a very, very long time and  right from er, the early days  the possibility of inactivating the biological properties of a toxin  while retaining their immunological properties has been attractive to people seeking to prevent these diseases. And, if you treat  this toxin with something like  formaldehyde or ethanol, you end up by inactivating it's  toxic properties and  you end up with what, what we call a  toxoid, something that retains immunological properties, it's able to stimulate specific immunity to the toxin  but it doesn't have  any of the toxic effects  and we end up with this toxoid vaccine  against diphtheria. And all of you, I would expect, have received the toxoid vaccine against diphtheria. Curiously it has led effectively to the irradification of Cherani bacterium diphtheria from the circulating respiratory flora in this country  and the reasons for that are are quite obscure! Another im prominent toxoid vaccine which you should all have received and be  regularly receiving boosters for is the tetanus  vaccine, and really, a very similar situation pertains here, that the toxin is so important in the pathogenesis of disease, tetanus, that simply immunity to that one factor can lead to immunity  er  to the disease as a whole. So, I've gone through  a series of examples  of exotoxins  I want to just  er, as far as is possible summarize  the general properties of exotoxins. First thing to be said about them is that they're all proteins  covering a very wide range of molecular weights  between three and three hundred kilobocals  three thousand to three hundred thousand bocals. And they have very specific impacts because they all result  their effective result on an interaction with a specific receptor  and  er  an activity I would express on that receptor or as a result of the er  erm  the uptake of the toxins. Consequently,. As I've indicated before  you can divide them into patha and physiological effects  and  membrane damage more specifically than what I said before  membrane damage is the  i i is a particularly important thing. Your patha and physiological toxins are often sub-unital structure  and  they make the most, the momegictiture most widely used  is an A plus B sub-unit structure. The B is a receptor   and A is often, although by no means always, an enzyme  and  in the case the cholera toxin  rotusis toxin  and  several other erm pseudo-membrane toxins and several others, diphtheria toxin  they have the specific A  viral   I think they put the    group onto a target molecule and disorder itself . The membrane doesn't use toxins  like the lytic toxins that staphylococcusorius expressed er  they're often detected by their immunelytic properties, see the  in the er, in the bacterial passage. I'm sure you've experienced in many instances here, the effect of lytic toxins  in er a boil or some  some other unpleasant minor lesion! Gonna go on now  to talk about a severe  condition  which may start out  that with a minor  skin rash like this, this is called a petechial  skin rash  they later progress to rather more generalised rash  and in it's most severe form  it's mucrotic \\neffects on the skin  and  er, obviously a lethal outcome! This type of picture is almost exclusively  related to the isolation of grand negative organisms from the blood, these may be phacili or  cocci, doesn't really make any  er, any difference. It's the grand nega negative  cell wall structure  that seems to matter. And we now know  that these  ghastly effects are the results of  what we referred to in the last lecture endotoxins. You will hear  in  considerable detail in a later lecture about how  septic shock and endotoxin  work. At this stage it's worth remarking that wa there are perhaps three  prominent features of endotoxin effects  first of all, they promote physcocine release and th the the two pro , prominent phsycocines affected are I O one, Interlooping one  and TMF, tumourmacrosis factor which I  hope you heard about in the  immunology course. I O one is  the molecule most closely associated with the mi , the effects of lodose endotoxin  and that is  fever  I O one  er, when released into the blood sys bloodstream  affects the hypothalamus and  th i one of the principle reasons why  infective conditions lead to fever. In more severe situations there's  uncontrolled continent acto activation  and uncontrolled clotting factor, activation and it's really that last  feature that's particularly responsible for the er  er  ghastly skin disease you saw  i in the last sla , in the previous slide! Now the eff the endotoxin as I've  is almost exclusively associated  with the grand negative cell wall. And again in  abbreviated form  that, I just want to take you through the molecular basis for endotoxin action. Here is the  positive wall with it's  large  er  expansive petroglycan  grand negative with an inner  and an outer membrane, and the petroglycan sandwiched in between. Here we have a diagram of a grand negative organism with it's inner membrane and outer membrane  illustrated here. Very easy to reproduce endotoxic shock in in experimental animals and  er, it was found fairly early on that  the effects, er the endotoxic effects were almost exclusively associated with the outer membrane. And detailed chemical strains of the outer membrane  show that it has a slightly different structure from normal unit membranes. Expand that up, you'll end up with  a normal inner leaflet to the membrane, a phospholipids  but  the outer the , er the outer layer is almost exclusively  composed of this stuff, lycropolysacrulite  I mentioned this in an earlier lecture but we need to go into  in a little bit more detail . This lycropolysacrulite is  can then be broken up into three different sections  the internal membrane section  is referred as lipid A.\\nLipids in general are not very antigenic erm  er  it's interesting  to note that lipid A, when it's purified from the other components is  almost totally responsible for the toxic amount  of any property. The polysacurised component of composed of a four region  to which the lipids are attached, and that outer region is  er, it extends out into the environment  . Now, the importance here is that  both of these polysacrulite components are based in general the outer region is highly variable, that's to say that  very, er that most of organisms  possess a unique outer region to that polysacrulite . And by contrast, the poor region, certainly amongst the grand negative bacilli  is very similar across a wide range of different species  and this provides a very important opportunity to produce immunity to endotoxin directed against the core  and  this  possibility has recently been exploited by a production of the molecule antibody directed against the core  polysacride of the erm  er er, of  ecoli. So, this has been shown to be effective in  moderating  the toxic  events which occur in grand negative shock. Building on this approach  and something which I think you'll see  certainly during the course of your  your medical studies  antibodies directed against  tumourler proce , tumourler process factor are now being used to try and interrupt the chain of events  at a slightly later stage. So that's  that's the endotoxin story. I want now just to summarise and er  some of these  the features I'm going to point out I've  I've already stated so you may  may just want to sit back and just take this in. If we compare endo and exotoxins  endotoxins are only associated with grand negative organisms  whereas exotoxins maybe produced by either grand negative  or grand positive. Endotoxins are exclusively cell associated in their production. Exotoxins may also be cell associated, they've, they may not be a sa , they're not a structural component, but, particularly in grand negatives  exotoxins er, are released first into the peraplasmic space, the space between the two membranes, and  the the actual release  into the medium  er, may require cell . So,tha they are both cell associated and cell free. Endotoxin  from different organisms  although it may be of  of different potency  has essentially the same biological effects. So, a wide variety of different organisms  can produce endotoxic shock. But exotoxins from different organisms  produce  really very different  biological effects. Even, even though they may be er,the they may work as a result of different o of the same enzyme activity in some cases  the target for that enzyme activity  and the receptors that have put it into the specific cells that are targeted  lead to really very different biological effects. In general terms  endotoxins are a very low potency  about point  O one of a gram is lethal to one person  some exotoxins are incredibly potent, and they're being the, the subject of er  a certain amount of er  weapons research. The same goes for O one of a gram  for example,toxin and it gives you  a hundred thousand  er as as I've  indicated here, there's a, a wide range for the potency. Endotoxins are heat stable, and this is very important when we  try to produce materials that are safe  for intravenous injection. Whereas, for the most part exotoxins are  destroyed by heat into a hundred degrees centigrade. And finally  treatment with er  formaldehyde or ethanol has no effects on endotoxins  but  in a number of instances  formaldehyde or ethanol will lead to  er, the production  of toxoid. So, I think you should now have  a very clear basis for discriminating between the two sorts of  two sorts of toxin. And  we can move safely on to another  another, and the final really, final topic about the patterns  of pathogenesis. Let's move on now, briefly, to consider this disease, tuberculosis. This is a, a normal test x- ray  the commonest manifestation of tuberculosis is  the disease of des destructive regions  in the upper poles  of the lungs  and pathologically  the very nasty destructive lesions er, are appearing  in  in the area. And in a mi , in a minority of cases  you may get a sort of forminant region, this is  er small scale, it's perhaps a centimetre apart, across  a series of lung lesions containing these little necrotic  due to the er  the presence of tubercle  cila. Although this was  this organism, microbacterium tuberculosis, named tuberculosis  was discovered back in eighteen eighty  we  we really understand the pathogenesis of the disease very poorly! What we know for sure is  is really outlined here. The organism is in  i is  inspired into the alveolar spaces  and it's taken up by alveolar , the  standard  er abbreviation for macrophage  and, the organism  i in contrast to many others which we've sort of er  die fairly rapidly after being taken up by these phagocytic cells, says Goodee! That was exactly what I wanted to happen! And it grows  very rapidly, within macrophages  and  after er  a period of time is actually disseminated into the circulation. Now, this happens in nearly all  er  cases o of tuberculosis  but, interesting, the vast majority  of infections microbacterium tuberculosis are asymptomatic  and the reason for that is that after a period of growth and dissemination does not lead to clinical symptoms, cell mediated immunity, C M I, comes into  comes into play  and you end up with a balance between the macrophages, and fi  and M T B, where there's a constant turnover of  macrophages  dying, and M T B  winning out.\",\n",
       " \"Excuse me! Hello! Yep? What's the M T B? Microbacterium tuberculosis. Okay. Thank you. You have a balance between the effects of macrophages which have been activated by  cell mediator immunity  and  the lethal effects of microbacterium tuberculosis. In individuals  in whom some mediated immunity is not well developed  the growth and defemination,de defemination phase may take over altogether. If the C M I doesn't lead to this kind of balance  then  it can have this sort of effect  and  get rapidly fatal tuberculosis occurring at the time of the primary  infection. But it's believed that the majority of cases of tuberculosis, that we actually see, are so called post-primary tuberculosis where all of this process is taking place asymptomatically  and  the host is in this state of balance but something else comes along and stresses cell mediated immunity  and the control breaks down so that th the organism M T B  wins out very dramatically over the, over the macrophages and you end up with this post-primary pattern  of tuberculosis. An example of th , of the stress might be  the administration of steroids  or the occurrence of another disease, most notably, in this day and age of course, aids, would lead to  T B coming out in this way. Is this a type of miliary ? Miliary er i it  it refers, well you've heard of millet seed and it's  it refers to a seeding of many different lesions  er, around the body  it means the disseminated form of  of tuberculosis where the lesions occur all over the place. Mm. You'll hear, you'll hear these things repeated many times again, both in the pathology, and in the microbiology course. So, that's er, really a very different pattern of infections  where the virulence factors are not clearly identified. Let me just finish off now  by  illustrating what leads  to the outcome and how a a of a particular infectious condition  and the combination of the factors that we think lead to these outcomes. I think, the best analogy I can produce for you is that a  a balance  in which  various factors act on the side of the host  and various factors act on the side of the organism, and the outcome  is disease and death if the organism wins out  and outcome is resistance or recovery  if the  the host wins out. And we could  really, add in for each organism in different weights  the significance of each of the factors on each side. So, for example, if we took diphtheria  we could say that the toxin  was  by far the most important and weighty factor, and that if we knock the toxin out  then the disease can't occur. And, similarly on the  the host side, we could say that antibody was the most important feature. In  another example in tuberculosis  we could say that the ability of the organism to persist inside macrophages  was the most important feature  and that effective cell mediated immunity  was the most important feature  on the host side. So, I hope I've introduced to you the very different styles by which microbes produce disease  and indicated the balance  of factors involved. Shall we start from the beginning?\",\n",
       " \"Yes\\nRight, mm, completely fresh start? Yes please. I was born in Wapping in the year nineteen hundred and six, my father was a docker, one of my earliest recollections is of the dock strike of nineteen hundred and eleven, in which I played a part lining up at the soup kitchens to get soup for the family. My father died when I was quite young and at ten years of age I went into a poor old orphanage where I stayed four years. I came out of the orphanage to go and live with my mother and I found myself one of the family of six living in one room, the house was a four roomed house plus a scullery. Each room was occupied by a separate family, there was one cold water tap for the whole of the four families and one outside toilet. Conditions such as those were quite common to many thousands of people and I think it was those conditions which helped to formulate and develop my political thinking. When I was eighteen I came in contact with the Catholic Crusade which was a rather left wing Christian Socialist Organization and I found that their attitude to problems contained the answers for which I had been searching for a good many years  tell me when you want me to raise something. Yeah, I'd like you to tell me about erm, what the house was that you left before you came to Harlow and why you came to Harlow? Yes,if we skip all the intermediate years with, after the war I came back from the army to find we'd been bombed out and were living in requisition accommodation, after a time, the, we were moved into a new flat over some shops. My wife was working for Cossors the electronic company and they moved to Harlow and er, it, in order for her to retain her job, we had to move to Harlow as well. This proved very difficult because, between the time of the decision being taken to move Cossors to Harlow and the time that my wife, my wife's department actually went, the Development Corporation had changed their policy and would not have married women as tenants. This resulted in a great deal of correspondence between myself and the Development Corporation and at the end of it I told my wife the best thing to do was to hand her notice in as there was no chance of us ever getting a house in Harlow, fortunately her services were much more seriously in demand then we imagined and the company nominated us for one, a house which is allocated to one of their executives, the house that we're living in now and have lived in ever since nineteen sixty three. The vast difference between Stroud Green Road, Islington and Harlow. For one thing Harlow is the sort of town which I'd been agitating for both before and after the war  whenever I was speaking on behalf of the Labour Party both at street corners and at public meetings on the type of life we vis envisaged for a normal person in the land. To leave Islington, to leave Stroud Green Road, to leave a flat which was over a shop overlooking a main shopping centre, overlooking a completely noisy main through road to come to Harlow was a difference between chalk and cheese. The accommodation differed in, in one respect and that, that was that in the flat we were on one floor, we had one bedroom, we moved into a house with two toilets separate bathroom and three bedrooms, which enabled us to spread our furniture around, enabled us to have visitors to receive members of the family. I think this is one of the essentials in Harlow and something that people should not forget, that is that, although there is a great deal of criticism possibly of the standard of building that went on over the years of the Development Corporation, compared with what most people came from, there was a very great elevation both in quality and in ideas. Perhaps today the general public take too much for granted, the, as a local Councillor I have to interview many people who come to me with housing problems, to be as patient as one can is essential as a politician, but after the complainant has gone, one is very conscious of the fact that their problem is so minute it is hardly worth mentioning. But nevertheless that's human nature and perhaps it's also a reason why life should not stand still, whatever progress we make both in housing and in quality of housing and the quality of life, once people are used to that, to that they expect more and this is what progress, what forward thinking is all about. Could you tell me about the house, of which you were bombed out? Was it, were you married at the time? Yes  I think that over the course of our married life we had a number of moves for various reasons, generally to improve the accommodation, erm as standard of life increased so the desire to have a better house to live in or rather in those days a house was out of the question, we generally had rooms in a house, erm, they, the flat for instance that we were bombed out from was a basement flat, erm according to the estate agents it was a garden flat, erm and it meant that you had access to the front garden and the back garden, but as for being a garden flat it was below the level of the garden in the front and at the back it was on the level with the erm green grass at the back of the house, it was also along side of the trolley bus depot, so there it was considerably noisy, nevertheless it was a self contained flat, the first one we'd had, no the second one we'd had and we were perfectly happy there although of course it did have minor difficulties, the fact that you used the front door with people who had flats on the other remaining three floors, but nevertheless it did involve you in a certain amount of community living, you were aware of your neighbours, you had to be very conscious of them and they were very conscious of you. That I think perhaps is one of the striking differences between that and living in a house in Harlow, where you may or may not know your immediate neighbours. Perhaps you know them over the garden wall to speak to you, you might even know their children by name and you know their christian name, but beyond that I think it's true to say, even making allowance of generation gaps that you don't know your neighbours in the same way that you knew your neighbours in London. Whereabouts was the basement flat, was it in Islington  \\nNo , that was in Islington but it was in the district called Holloway\\nOh yes I know it well\\nMm\\nPenventon Gardens\\nPenventon Gardens, is the hou oh of course it's not there\\nIt's not there, mm, yeah \\nif it was bombed out yes\\nYou were in the army weren't you? Oh I was yes, I was\\nArmy\\nI was enjoying life in the army while my wife was enjoying the bombing. She was actually in the house when the bomb dropped on the other side of the road and she was flung down two flights of stairs and the piano on the other side of the room here bears the scars of the bombing. And that curtain went from the window right across the room and pinned itself into the piano, pinned the curtains into the piano. And it also managed to chip some of the woodwork, curious to think that I was offered as war damage compensation five pounds to re-case the piano, you couldn't of had it repolished for five pounds, but thinking was working class people shouldn't have pianos, I'm certain that was at the back of, of the gentleman whose job it was to evaluate war damage, he certainly raised his eyebrows every time we told him, what either a piece of furniture or crockery or cutlery which had been destroyed had cost and he was so foolish after er the house had been almost flattened as de demand bills as proof of evidence that your figures were correct \\nMm, so when you left your, when you came back you said that you went into a requisition property\\nYes, erm, we found ourselves in, rather to go back. After the bombing my wife was housed with an with another family\\nWho had been bombed\\nin the top flat, they, they were rehoused in a flat in a block of mansion flats and when I came out of the army this was the accommodation I found available, er for me and I objected strongly and after a great deal of fuss erm the Islington Borough Council's Housing Department found us rooms on the first floor in a Victoria Victorian villa in Penventon Gardens, which erm, were comfortable\\nNot Penventon Gardens\\nEr not erm\\nwas that\\nSunnyside Road\\nSunnyside Road\\nSunnyside Road\\nSunnyside Road, and erm, it were  it was good accommodation we had our own bathroom and toilet er but again accommodation was cramped, we had no spare room\\nAnd we weren't proud, there was people came\\nand er the people in the flat above us had to pass our door to get to them in the same way that we had to pass the people, tenants below doors to get to their accommodation. Erm from there we went into this purpose built flat above a grocers shop, it was meant for the manager of the grocers shop, but he had better sense and so the flat became available for letting to the Borough Council who at the insistence of the owners of the house we were in, erm, were anxious to get their property back and so we found ourselves in a brand new flat, the first tenants, although this was not very highly to be recommended, you approached your flat up er stone staircase, er from the outside so you exposed to the elements er you then walked across the roof, flat roof over the shops until you came to your flat door, erm, Islington at that time was just beginning the, to see the influx of immigrants from the colonies as they were in those days and er, they in turn created much heavier demand on what little vacant property there was, so that the district rapidly deteriorated and  for many people who were not in the fortunate position that we were found it necessary or desirable to leave because they were sharing rooms or sharing houses with people whose ways of life were different from theirs and this is something I think that housing authorities learnt to appreciate over the years that the differences between people's ways of life are one of the major causes of social distress. What year was that when you moved into erm Sunnyside Road? We moved into Sunnyside Road in nineteen forty five and we moved into erm Stroud Green Road\\nFifty three \\nsomewhere about nineteen fifty three, yes\\nin our town house\\nand we left Sunnyside Road in sixty three to come to Harlow. So you've only been in Harlow since nineteen sixty three? Twenty years yes\\nYes\\nit'll be twenty years next March\\nMhm. Could you explain to me a little bit more when you said that erm a married woman couldn't be a tenant. Yes, erm, when Harlow was designed, it was appreciated that its, the, its purpose was to house workers in the factories and the offices and also to act as an overspill from London, and in nineteen sixty when Cossors were bringing their workers by the hundreds\\nFifty eight\\nFifty eight was it? When, in nineteen fifty eight when Co Cossors were bringing, started bringing their workers here the Development Corporation were very anxious to let houses and, so that it, it didn't matter whether the worker was male or female, he or she was accepted as a tenant, by the time we came to move in Harlow in nineteen sixty three the Development Corporation reneged on its promise to house my wife. At that time erm, I was a commercial traveller and Harlow was part of my district and they reluctantly accepted the fact that because I was a commercial traveller working in Harlow that I actually did work in Harlow which was stretching a point, but I really think that the Development Corporation's officials were getting a little tired of my being able to talk their own language and to write letters in the same vein as they could write, they weren't used to this, and, at any rate, as I said earlier we got here. We were offered some awful things though, in the first place\\nErm, I've always been interested in housing and it did appear to me that however delightful Harlow may be, when the architects were designing properties, they designed a property without any consideration for the people who were to live in them. We were offered a flat, which would of mea if we'd of accepted it would of meant we would have to of sold every stick of furniture because the rooms were not large enough\\nCan you tell me the name of the block of flats or the address of it? That was er a flat in Plumtree, we were offered a flat on the first floor and when we examined the kitchen it was extremely obvious to me that our gas cooker wouldn't fit in the, the place where it was designed to fit, when I asked where do we put the washing machine I was informed that most tenants kept the washing machine on the balcony, when I said well where do we put the refrigerator, well most people keep the refrigerator either in the hall or, or rather not a hall it was a passageway, in the passageway or in the living room, now it does seem to me with hindsight that if that's planning I, to use an old fashion London phrase, I'm a Dutchman. Was the living room a com a com combined sitting and dining room? Combined everything except bedroom, there was one separate bedroom\\nOnly one bedroom? Yes  erm, it was very obvious from the word go that they didn't want us. It was for a single person really wasn't it there? Well I would of thought so, although today it must be admitted that single people, don't get offered one bedroom flats, but then in those days there wasn't the shortage of accommodation that there is today \\nNext question\\nErm, could you tell me erm something about how you felt about the change of coming to this house, you know whether you enjoyed it? Well I suppose at the, one of the best things, best examples of the difference was that my wife when she saw this house, knew that it was a house in which she could be happy, in which her tastes and, could spread themselves, erm rather than her tastes having to be curtailed by lack of space and lack of accommodation, erm, the fact that I had a garage which was essential er next to my house instead of some er quarter or twenty minutes' walk away from where I lived as happened in London also made a terrific difference to comfort, erm the fact that there was a garden instead of a few windowboxes and a couple of tubs, all these things I think made one appreciate the fact that you'd come, not only into a new town, but into a new way of life  probably the fact that we had a staircase inside the house, which was the first time that we'd had a staircase between our bedrooms and our living rooms\\nMm\\nso in all purp in, in always, the fact that you'd come into this house made one realize that there'd been a distinct change in one's circumstances. And did you feel that it affected your lifestyle? That you could do, you mention that you could now entertain\\nErm\\nyour friends\\nwell we always had entertained friends but we'd never been in a position to put them up so that erm  most of our friendly visits were from people who didn't live very far from us, it meant that families, nieces, nephews etcetera were difficult to accommodate because they had to sleep on a couch or a settee in the living room with all its diff difficulties, especially when it meant in the morning for breakfast you had to get them up and dressed before you could start thinking about breakfast, and I think that those sort of things are things that er people ought to take into consideration when thinking about new housing. One of the beefs I have about accommodation for elderly people is the fact that by, that the purpose built, very excellent, bungalows and flats for elderly citizens are restricted to one bedroom which, to which but is by government decree to keep the cost down, but it does seem to me to be very heartless because elderly people's children are unable to come and stay with them except to the great deal of discomfort and perhaps as society grows a little more considerate for the fact that the percentage of elderly people will get even greater as the years go on, then they should make allowance and provide them for the facilities to enable them to be visited by their children and grandchildren. Did you erm leave family behind when you came away from London? No we never had a family so we were entirely foot free and foot loose. But apart from children I meant sisters or brothers \\nOh yes \\nor parents or\\nyes, erm my wife came from the Midlands, from Coventry and  her family roots were in Coventry at the Midlands, in fact there she still has numerous nieces and nephews and great nephews and great nieces there to this day, my with the exception of a sister who moved, who, to Basildon, erm I have two brothers and er they still live in London, still live in East Ham, er the distance is not too great erm and, but obviously as we get older the amount of visiting we do will be constricted by the difficulties of getting from Harlow to East Ham especially when one is compelled to stop driving a motor car \\nDid you bring furniture with you when like when you moved into Harlow? Oh yes, yes, we, the  we had an extremely large rooms, I don't know went, what, what, what went wrong the architect but we had two enormous rooms which could of been quite easily divided into three, but we could of had two bedrooms instead of one and the conse \\nEr, sorry to interrupt you are you speaking about this house? No, the flat\\nThe flat, right\\nthe flat in, in London, the flat we came from and so we had accumulated a little more furniture than one would usually have in two rooms and the kitchen and we got here and were allowed to spread ourselves, if there's one criticism that one could say about this house, is that the  size of the rooms  confines you to what you put in them, they're square, that the, the division between the living room and the dining room is through a pair of glass doors, where perhaps that could of been arranged with either sliding doors or some other feature so as not to separate it yet again into two square boxes  and erm \\nAre you in favour of open plan? er, it depends on one's own tastes, I personally don't like the open planned that I've seen in very modern houses where, erm I, I don't quite know how to express it but it does seem to me odd to be on one floor level and then two feet up you're on another level and er, that's one aspect of the open plan that doesn't appeal to me and I don't quite understand why it's necessary to have everything that's going on in one room with pieces of furniture designed to act as barriers between the different functions or purposes for which you give parts of the room. So how do you  how do you see the ideal way of arranging a room? The ideal way, way of arranging a room as I see it would be that you could have your separate rooms but have sliding doors, after all there's nothing new in sliding doors, er, but doors opening and closing erm are restrictive, that's only my own personal view, my wife doesn't necessarily, necessarily share that view  ideally if I was planning a house, the main room the main living room would be much larger than the one we live in, it would certainly be a different shape, erm when we had our golden wedding erm our visitors were so numerous that they were standing shoulder to shoulder in these two rooms and the kitchen whereas if it had been a reasonably designed house maybe we could of spread them around a little more, but they're minor, minor defects that are not really serious. I think today that if someone was designing a house one would incorporate all the modern additions which have suddenly become fashionable such as double porches, doubleglazing and er patio windows, I think that these things are perhaps a development from, in the same way as this house is a development from the rooms and the flats we lived in in London so that the modern conceptions of the things I've mentioned could be incorporated as normal in the house certainly would be cheaper to incorporate them when building the house than adding them on. When was this house built? Well I don't know the exact date but I believe this house is some thirty years old, so it was built about nineteen fifty three, fifty two, fifty three\\nDoes it have central heating? Does it have central heating? No it has central heating now, but it didn't when we moved in. Did you own the house? No \\nErm, did the Council put the central heating in? Council put the central heating in when we got  advanced in years and when it became necessary in the doctor's opinion for me to have central heating because I had a heart complaint. So it's, the, the Council doesn't install central heating as a matter of course only if it's a special case? The Council has a policy now of bringing all its properties up to date, but priority because they're, bringing the houses up to date will take some eight years, priority is given to elderly citizens and people with medical needs. Do you like the orientation of the house? Do you feel that it's pointing the right way, bringing the sun in through the right windows at the right time of day? That's a little difficult to answer, if you're watching television, the sun can be a nuisance\\nYes of course \\nwhen it comes in, pours in those, the house faces west er consequently although it's very pleasant in the afternoon and evenings when you're not watching television erm, it has its drawbacks on the other hand the garden is most unfortunately orientated  alright? I think that's a minor problem but perhaps architects now pay a little more attention to and that is that, in the afternoon when you like to sit in the evening when you like to sit in the garden in the sunshine you are sitting in the shadow because the house er is between the sun and the garden \\nI can't think of any more questions for the moment\\nAlright \\nSo do you think I could ask you something about what you please tell \\nNo we're alright \\nplease tell me when you want me to go because \\nYeah \\nif I over st don't let me over stay\\nNo, no, no, no. Er I liked to ask you erm about if you, if you think that Harlow lives up to the ideal of the New Town? It could be asked what is disappointing about Harlow, and I suppose that the first thing that strikes one is the design fault so far is the road work, the road network is concerned and er, and the inadequacy of the road, for roads for modern traffic. Very obviously when this town was designed and laid out and nobody foresaw the growth of the private motor car, er today private motor car is accepted, but in a town which was built perhaps the idea that one in twenty would own a motor car and we're now faced with the probably  one in three have a motor car, we're now faced with a problem which can only detract from life in the town, also the fact that huge lorries are passing through what were envisaged as quiet residential neighbourhoods with a consequent breaking of curbs and of paving stones where the lorries are compelled to mount the pavings in order to get round parked cars and things of that nature it detracts from the life in Harlow I do, I think a considerable extent, erm, the other factor is that there's become a lack of pride in the town by the people who live in it, this is seen from the amount of rubbish, and refuse that is dropped from the minor vandalism that goes on the graffiti, er particularly in underpasses where people are walking to the town centre and that, those are the things where the town has lost its way, when we first came here you never saw bits of paper and packages from sweets and cigarettes and things, perhaps maybe because the package industry has developed over the years and that er  whereas whenever we had responsibility for taking a small child out, if it had sweets it was encouraged to put the wrappings in its pocket until it got home, now of course it's encouraged to drop it just where it wants to and er this not only applies to children, some of the worst culprits are the adults who leave the, leave the public houses with a can of beer to drink on the way home and drop it just when they've finished the last drop of beer or the fish and chip paper's just dropped. I think this is detracting, I think it's inconsiderate, it certainly shows a lack of respect for one's neighbours or indeed for the town one lives in and yet very often I'm fully aware of the fact that the people who do the dropping are the first to complain that the Council doesn't keep the town clean. What, do you think that there's any connection between what you mentioned before about when you claimed for er bomb damage erm that working class people about being, supposed to have a piano, do you think there's a connection between that sort of idea and the idea of people that lived in Harlow in Council houses shouldn't have cars? No, I don't think that had a great deal to do with it, erm it was question that when the town was designed  the, there hadn't been this sudden burst in living standards. If you compare when we first came to Harlow, which is only twenty years ago, the possession of a television set, erm was only just becoming the normal thing\\nMm\\nthe possession of the motor car was just becoming the norm, but the town had been designed fifteen years earlier \\nAnd what do you think of the idea of ways that the, that the way the house types were graded, the fact that some of them were in fact meant to be executive or managerial classes and others were meant to be for people with less income, do you think that this is again recreating this sort of class system within the planning of the town? I think that what we've got is the acceptance by the designers and the planners of the class system that they knew\\nMm\\nthey had no vision of a classless society, erm, personally while I've no desire to see uniformity, I see no earthly reason why some people because they have a lower income should be compelled to live in inferior and perhaps crowded conditions, whereas the man with five or six or seven times their income can choose a larger house in a much more delightful district and I think it is things like that that make the difference between what I as a young socialist agitator was advocating and what we find today. I find too that circumstances compel a socialist Council like Harlow to be constrained and constricted when building, there are too many laws and regulations which are based on the fact that, for instance, today's government thinks that people who rent houses are second class citizens. Can you give an example  when you say that the law is designed? Yes, erm, let us take one little factor, this question of the agitating the media and the, today, and that is the reduction in interest charges. Now when interest charges fall, the person who is buying the house benefits from the reduction in interest charges, but the person who is renting a house in local authority and then in this case nobody, nobody else in Harlow to rent it from, is faced with, not with a decreased monthly rental, but with an ever increasing one because as more and more Council houses are sold the cost of maintaining that there, the superstructure of the town, the cost of maintaining Council houses goes on increasing and so the burden is laid on the tenants and the tenant can find, will find himself that pound for pound increasing his rent while the house owner is decreasing his mortgage charges and at the end of the day the tenant is paying increased rent, increased rate and with nothing to show for it, erm, I've always been in favour of a sale, of, of property er owner occupiers, but not at the expense of the people who cannot afford to be owner occupiers, ah, to my mind, the present housing system is designed to maintain the existing class structure because even with the large discounts that one gets and nobody's ever yet convinced me that why you should get a discount because you buy a Council house, but if you buy one privately owned you can't get a discount and it, there's, this, this is so utter nonsense, but it is throwing a much heavier burden every time a house is sold on the remaining houses which are for rent, and so you that, although the idea is to make it a classless this society with more and more people owning their own properties the mo the mere fact that the majority of people in the town cannot afford to buy even the reduced priced Council house, is an example that the, the system, the class system a division by income still exists.\",\n",

       " \"Anything at all. But that's about the most I had.

Aha. I mean it didn't come for, come out for  arthritis. Arthritis , no. It came out for something else. And I've used it oh, for about thirty odd years. I never found anybody with any trouble  ever having any trouble with it. And yet when folk got it for their arthritis, okay? Yeah\\nThere's no trouble with er with the Sulfasalazine \\nAye. So there should be no problem. Yeah, that's right. Renal problems and er I was having bowel problems   ulcers in my mouth.\",\n",

       " \"er  and  you know. having a  that's what it's . That's right, that's right. Thanks . Okay. , Jon.\",\n",
       " \"Right. Bye. We need you in a semicircle and the best way to do that is to push your chairs roughly around that grey line \\nThere's a nice swivelly one \\nErm you pass those round in either direction, from now on it's, it's bandage time. Denise is going to do bandaging and I'm going to do bandaging and so are you, so you have these packs and these packs, if you'd like to take one pack each, I don't know if there's a pin in them, you might find a pin in there\\nplease look after them and bring them back each day, you'll find a bandage and a roll of bandage in there  and  so their your own properties \\nIn your text book you've got quite a lot of information in there about reinforcing, what we're going to do in the practical session and it's always a help I think when you have a lot of the, thrown at you to know that you can just put it up and there it is if you get a bit confusing or can't remember what's what, so on page one six nine it starts telling you all about nursing and bandages and general hygiene which we've already talked quite a lot about but it's very useful for you to know, you can go there and look, and if you just go through the pages from there on one seventy, one seven one, one seven two, one seven three and then on one seven four it's got the general rules for applying bandages  apply bandages when the casualty is sitting or lying down, you always sit your casualty down and you work from the front of, I say why do you work from the front of the thing? So you can keep\\nSo you can see how they're looking, see if they're going pale a bit or if they're going to fall off their chair and talk and reassure them. That's right, erm always make sure that the injured parts are well supported  bandages should be firm enough to do the job and large enough to cover the wound all of this is the sort of thing which you need to be referring back to if you're in any doubt. On page one seven five you've got how to check the circulation, after you've put the bandage on to make sure it's not too tight, it's not stopping all the blood supply, press a fingernail if there's only a finger nail and the, it should go white of course if you press it, then the blood should go back and it goes back pink again or an area of er skin, always check your circulation after you've put your bandage on. Now when you've actually opened your pack you'll find, what you got your triangular bandage here. Now I'm going to show you now how you going to put it away again, fold it, afterwards, opening it up \\nalright, everyone open their bandage up? Now when it's opened it's useful as a sling, two sorts of slings we're going to do, high sling and the low sling but also if you fold it, it's very useful as a bandage too, if you put it across your knee, then you bring the point up towards you like that  and then again, fold it the base up to the top  again . and again face up to the top and there you've got a bandage, okay? One stage before that you've got a very broad bandage which is helpful for supporting things, we'll learn about how to use that later. When you've got it to the final fold there you've got your ordinary\\nfold bandage and if you want, pack it away like that, you bring the end in the centre, there, so and again the ends in to the centre, just so that they meet like this, like this the centre, just so that they meet there, again, start like this, ends just to meet in the centre don't overlap them too much and again bend into the centre and you've got a nice little pad, if you ever need a pad for plonking on a wound quickly, there you've got a pad, or putting against an ear or anything you want it for and you open it up quickly and you've got a bandage, two of those and you've got a\\nbut it's a very handy way to keep. When you've got your  bandage in your pack, I've explained to you before, you open it up in the first aid kit it's sterile, yeah, you open it up by the\\none hand goes one way, one hand goes the other, break it open, put the cardboard away and you need to be ready to try before you pull the next bit off don't you because as soon as you've opened that it's not sterilized any more, so you open that up  and you find, unwrap it\\nunwrap it as I showed you before with the first aid kit,\\ncomes out first  and then you see how the padding because this wadding is stitched onto the back, and the front is the bit you put against the wound and you put it straight against the would without\\nor touching it and that pad should be big enough to cover the wound, so you should something, overlaps, alright, and then if you find, if you unwrap the roll a little bit further, you don't want to unroll it completely, your see that if while you're using it in practice you need to roll it up again backwards towards the back of the bandage like so, we'll roll it up again, backwards and when you get to the bandage you just fold the bandage up around the long end and wind the short end round it firmly and there it's ready for use again in practice, you wouldn't of course do that for real would you? Put away, use another one. So that's how you look after your bandages and all these things that we're going to show you you'll find in those little sections in your first aid book so if you get confused or why you've only got to look up in the book. Let's do the sling first. I thought we'd do the sling first, high sling because it's very important to get it high and not pull it, everyone, anyone gets asked to do the high sling in their exam and if you can put a good high sling on you're halfway  to passing \\nMm\\nand from that it can't be bad can it? So I'll be the casualty and at the moment we won't worry about all the various things you use a high sling for, we just want to make sure that you can actually do it, okay? Can you just come back a little further and then they'll be able to see, better if all round the side\\nOkay? Right, now then, be like this I'll pretend that I've done something that needs to be, a high sling to support me in this fashion. And I, I'm going to be working from behind Denise because you all need to see, but you would be working from the front as I've already talked about, so you need your triangular bandage, alright, and there's your long edge, and there's your point as we call it, a sort of elbow shaped, think of that as elbow shaped because it always goes towards the injured elbow. Now, that when you arrange your sling in the first place, it's crucial to the success and ease of which you finalize the bit round the elbow. You arrange it so that this long side is vertically up and down the body, right, in that direction. Don't let it come across like that, the temptation is to think that you've got to have all this bit up here, now you don't want this up here because it's very difficult to cope with once you've tied it round to get it round the elbow, you want the least amount that you can get, just cover the arm and then it makes it much easier to deal with at the end. The amount at the top that you need is just enough to tie a reef knot oh I've forgot to show you a reef knot didn't I? Tie a reef knot. We all use a reef knot in erm first aid and again it is in the book a very good illustration in the book\\nreef knot and then nobody knows how to do it, I will show you in a bit, but that's enough to do a knot, the knot comes on just above the fingers, in the hollow of the neck, okay? So that's how you arrange it like that, the first thing you then do is to tuck the spare bit under the hand, cos the hand then there anchors it for you\\nOkay? and the hand doesn't sneak out afterwards and starts popping out and then it's useless, then the rest of all this stuff you just get it out of the way under the arm, it's all gone, right, this bit comes up between the two shoulder blades, don't make the mistake of bringing it across there, a lot of people do that, that won't do, you have to come round the back and between these two shoulder blades to get maximum support, you've got to hold this elbow up and then you tie it near the hand, now I recommend that you tie it and talk to your casualty, half tie it and say is that supporting you enough? It feels okay thanks, yeah \\nCos then you can draw it up a little tighter if it's too loose, if it's like that and, most people do it too loose, is that tight enough? No it isn't. Right I'll just draw it up a little bit tighter, is that tighter for you? Better, better\\nAnd now I'll do the other half of my reef knot, right, and tuck the ends in immediately, they don't like seeing ends because they're considered dangerous in first aid so don't forget to do it, do the knot, tuck it in all in one movement and then it's done, okay, how does that feel? That's fine\\nOf course you're reassuring all the time as you do this\\nMm, mm\\nGot a bit that's fall down\\nHello we haven't finished yet, haven't finished. Now you're gonna want a pin, these are rather small pins, I recommend that peop people who have got large hands try and fit their first aid kit out with large pins, they're much easier to handle, but firstly they do not put pins in their mouths for obvious reasons, either, either have it on the table open ready or just pop it in the front of shirt while you do this bit, okay? So you're going to fold this around the elbow to give support to the arm and in this one you're gonna fold first of all forward  and then back, can you see that little neat envelope? A neat little envelope that's supporting quite firm, that's supporting the elbow, now pin it, again, now you can see how important it is not to have lots and lots of bandage up here, cos what will you do with it then? It's too much, if you ever have too much you can just fold a bit down, if you have a big bandage you can fold either of those edges down first if you've got too much and then you fold it forward and back, now your pin sticks in, but all the material and out of all the material and it goes in a straight upward direction, again it must go in that direction so that if per chance it comes undone it falls out and drops on the floor, whereas if it was sideways or downwards it would open and stick in your casualty, so that's why we have it done that way. Would you like to see that again or do you think you could manage it now? See it again\\nSee it again, right, I'll just do it this time without talking it through, and you can just watch\\nYeah\\nand I tell you what we shall do we shall change arms\\nWe'll change arms as well \\nyou'll need to practise on both arms. And there's no use getting in the exam on Thursday and say ah well I'm afraid I've not done it on that arm so erm lost\\nOkay, so there you are you see, you're, you're a first aider and you come up to the person and you hold it the way you did last time and you think ah, now that's the wrong way round of course, there's my elbow point, there's my injured elbow, so I have to be that way round, mm, so you turn it round the other way, right, your elbow shape goes to the injured elbow and your long line goes straight up and down the line of the body, you arrange it so that you only just covering the forearm there, with just enough above the hand to tie your reef knot  that would be too little and that would be too much  just enough above the hands to tie your reef knot, the first thing you do is to tuck nice, big bit of material right under the hand and anchor it into position, just keep that resting there and all the rest of this goes under the arm up between the shoulder blades there and you tie your first half of the reef knot just above the fingers in the hollow of the neck here, now that's important because round the back here if you press on that bit of muscle there, there's a big band of muscle, if you've got a knot on that it gives a great deal of discomfort very quickly so you want to get the knots round in the hollow here that doesn't hurt your casualty, there, draw it up half the knot, is that tight enough? It feels fine\\nYeah\\nthat feels fine \\nand then do your other half of knot, reef knot and tuck it in straight away, you get your pin ready, have it on, either on the table or ready like that, now if you've got too much material ever you just fold that down, there, if that's too much, which isn't too much with Denise because it's the right size sling, sometimes you have to improvise and then you fold if forward and back, firmly, take the pin and put it, put your two fingers down between the casualty so that your fingers are apart and there's a space between your fingers so you can stick the pin in and out again without any danger, if you put the fingers apart like that, if you do stick the pin in yourself and draw blood would you please throw the pin away, as a matter of automatic hygiene, it mustn't be used again once it's been stuck into somebody\\nOr in your casualty\\nor in your casualty, it must be thrown away\\nDo it up, discard it\\nAlright\\nget another one from the box \\nwould you please make sure that all through these practices that you deal with different people all the time cos in the exam and for real afterwards you'll have to bandage all different shape people and if you just get, work in pairs you don't get that sort of practice, by all means start of with somebody next door to you but each time you do one go across the room and find somebody you haven't done before. And if the gentleman having to put bandages on a lady and you want to put your hand underneath there just excuse me a moment, alright, because in the exam one row of you will certainly going to have a lady bandage okay, put slings on and to bandage so it's just as well not to get to you know used to bandaging up great big chaps and then you'll find you've got some little tiny five foot two or five foot nothing lady bandaging in exam, alright, so swap around, so get yourselves so you've got a partner and use your bandages and let's just see you do the high sling to start. All got safety pins by the way? Yeah they had them in the little packs, okay? Right\\nHow many people know how to do a reef knot for sure? No\\nRight, so I'm not wasting my time\\na reef knot then? If, if you look in your books page one seven seven, you'll see a beautifully illustrated instruction on how to do it, which you can refer to yourself this evening or later on in the course if you forget but I'm now gonna show you how to do one as well, you, if you want to know it's there for you to look up  you take the bandage and fold it into your narrow fold band  and put it round your leg, you've got something to tie a reef knot round, okay?if you know how to do a reef knot already fine, just do it, if you don't, follow instructions. Narrow fold bandage  you've done it correctly then. The\\ndoing it the same way each time and a reef knot is the opposite way each time, alright, undo it, once again, just once again to make sure you know  are you ready? Once again, now it doesn't matter which way round you start, you can start left over right or right over left, but the second time you do it opposite to the first time, so the first time I put the left one over first and the right one over that and then tuck it through, just like tying a shoe lace really, okay? And the next, pick the ends up, I put the right one down first and the left one across it and then put that one through and then that's a reef knot  no that's a granny over there anyone not sure? That, that's the one  you have to remember which one you put on which, that was the left on top of the right, now the right on top of the left  yes, come on\\nwhich one did you do first? That's the right on top of the left okay, right on top of the left, now you've crossed over again left on top of the right, put that through there  okay  yeah \\nAll okay I think\\nmm, yes all okay now, right. I bang my head, I cut my scalp, yeah, everybody, I bang my head, I cut my scalp, not massive bleeding none of the bandages we're doing this morning are to do with massive bleeding, they're all to do with what we call minor wounds, right so small cut, but it needs attention, okay, so I cut my scalp\\nCor\\nokay so I've got my pad\\nit's a bit tender\\nalright, so I'm going to ask my casualty to hold my nice clean sterile pad that I've got folded ready over the wound, there, gently, okay? Yep\\nThen I'm going to take another triangular bandage and I'm going to open it up and make just a little fold, this is going to go on her forehead and that little fold just helps with keeping it firm and stopping the bandage slip, now, just put it around the forehead like that, okay? Cross it over, round the back, and back up to the front again, do a reef knot here  and tuck your ends in straight away of course like so and then this little bit can just be tucked up where you've crossed the two ends and make it look neater with no ends hanging out, no that, all that does is keep the dressing secure, keep infection out, okay? The difficult part about this one is that people all have odd shaped heads, now and you find that if you put them on too high they squidge off like that, and you've got to think of bandaging an egg basically, if you had an egg with a little hole in one end and you've got to put a bandage round you'd have to put it very carefully round the widest bit wouldn't you for it to stay firm and that's the secret, everyone's heads different and as you put it round you've got to see where you can get it, where, sometimes it's over the ears, sometimes it's above the ears according to the peoples' shaped, different shaped heads everyone's different, anything else? Okay, have a go at it and we'll come round and correct what you're doing as you're doing it, alright, so you want to pad over the wound to keep infection out and then try to get your bandage on top of that to keep the dressing in place. Right, well we want to make sure that you can get out to lunch sort of by, that's running a bit fast that clock, we'd like to get you out to lunch by about half past twelve otherwise you'll end up being late don't you with all the other people\\nright\\nRight, okay, what now, erm roller bandages so you can put those triangular ones away for a minute can't you\\nLet's do the elbow\\nand we'll do the elbow and knee  okay elbow and knee then using the roller bandage\\nAnd again here it is two pages further on in your book, if you forget how to do it, just look up, okay? Roller bandages\\nWell I fell over, slipped over in the car park out there, all gravelly and gritty out there and I scraped my elbow and I've got a nasty graze all on the elbow and it's all full of grit and muck, help\\nCome and sit down here my dear\\nhelp\\nlet's give us a little \\nnow if we've got a tap handy probably the best thing would be to run it under the cold tap and that hopefully would take away any dirt and extra bits and pieces that are stuck around it. If there's anything embedded in it like gravel or something and it doesn't come away easily you mustn't, it comes under the categories of what you call foreign bodies, which first aider is not at liberty to poke about, you must leave foreign bodies that don't come away easily where they are and bandage them round and send them off to hospital or a doctor, but assuming it's just a little clean graze, if I haven't got a tap to put it under, then I must use little bits of gauze to wash, put in a bowl of water and just wipe, yeah, and you always wipe obviously from the centre of a wound towards the outside, otherwise if you start to wipe across the whole thing you take dirt from one side of the wound across and drop it off in the middle somewhere, so you wipe from the centre out and throw that piece away and you take another piece and wipe from the centre out and so on until you feel happy, quite happy. I mean, well if you haven't got gauze in your first aid box, but you could have something like a Mediwipe or you might be able to use, open up your bandage and you can use, you know, several pieces of this, just keep going down the bandage and then you know clean it and get rid of that bit, okay, another clean bit okay, so you can adapt with whatever you've got in your first aid box, yes, and you won't necessarily have scissors to hand so you'll have to do whatever you've got and the little Mediwipes are very useful for that, but don't use one Mediwipe for seventy five grazes, okay, one Mediwipe for one wipe and then discard, okay? Okay, so I'm going to open up my sterile dressing now \\nSo I actually put my arm out straight for you now? Do you think it'd be better if you had it bent cos it'll be easier for you after I've bandaged it \\nIt's better bent is it? Yes\\nOkay, alright \\nit would be better if you can manage \\nalright \\nto bend if it's not too uncomfortable \\nso I can bend it, I can bend it like that then? Right, you can only bend, you can only put the arm in the position that your casualty will let you of course, but it is more comfortable to have it bandaged in that position, than having it like that. So you open it up and you find which is your sterile bit and you put that over the point of the elbow and you can bring that once around and you can ask her to hold it for you, if you like \\nIt goes in there \\nright\\nyes\\nand then you take your long end and you wind above covering the edge and overlapping and then the low, then covering the edge and overlapping, there and again you keep working your way up and  down, a figure of eight until you get to the end of your bandage then tie away from the body in your reef knot, either you tuck your ends in or if that's awkward you can just put a sticking plaster over the ends to get them out of the way like that, so just tuck the ends in and I don't think your casualty's going to need a sling for a little graze like that\\nRight, and so that she can still move\\nand as the same thing applies to the knee exactly the same thing, wound there you keep the knee bent a little bit and you can do exactly the same bandage like a figure of eight, okay? So one person will do the bandage on the elbow and the other person with the good looking knees, you'll be the casualty for where you've got to put the knee bandage on, cos you won't, if you don't roll your trousers up a bit you're not going to have much bandage to do much bandaging with on the knee, okay, so decide amongst yourselves who's got the good looking knee\\nEverybody okay now?\",\n",
       " \"Yeah\\nYeah? Excuse me I've got a circulation problem\\nNow \\nAll okay then? Yeah? A couple more to show you then you can practise these when you have a bit more practice time so we can get you out to lunch on time. If you have to bandage a hand for example, okay? Somebody's slipped over and they've got all the grit in their knuckles in the part of their knuckles and you want to bandage the hand or there's a cut on the hand, even on the palm, we can do that one later when it's really, when it's really a gash, gushing blood we can do this afternoon, I repeat again none of these which you've done this morning will control severe bleeding, get it into your heads this is just to cover to keep infection out, alright, these are not to control severe bleeding just covering a minor wound or a graze, right? So she's got her knuckles grazed, you've cleansed it, put it into a drop of water,ra or else we've used the Mediwipes or the end of the bandage okay, now we just cover it, okay, so it goes over, can you just straighten out your hand for me, it goes over the wound, okay and you can take this one that she can hold it for you just up there, right, now the rest of this just winds round, the only thing you really need to do is to just make sure that you leave the thumb out, cover up the bottom right and then come up towards the wrist, cover up the top of the pad, come back down again, leave the thumb out all the time, got the idea? Right, cover up again, come up towards the wrist, if you've got any more bandage, go round perhaps one more time  okay and just make sure at the end of the day that you don't tie too tightly round the wrist, why not? Stop circulation\\nAbsolutely, so really we want to tie away from this pulse point here towards the back of the hand, good enough\\nYeah\\nright, tie it off in a reef knot, if you've got bits that are left dangling they're too long and you can't go round again because it's gonna make it too tight, you can either tuck them in or else you can fold them down, a nice clean plaster and put it right over the top, okay? Now that would do, that would do whether the, whether the knuckles were hurt or it was just a minor cut in the palm of the hand there, that would do and you can use the same type of bandage on the foot  alright, so that's if the hand was damaged, now supposing we didn't have the hand damaged, but we had instead a cut up here, okay, again clean it and if you clean it with lots of water always remember to dry off around the wound because bugs love a moist skin to grow in, dry the wound before you apply the dressing okay if you can, dry it off the best you can and then you're going to place that over the cut, remember you want the pad to be long enough, big enough, okay, now she can hold this for you again, she can hold it above where the wound is and now when you bandage this one you always bandage from the narrow part to the fat part of the limb, you always bandage from the narrow to the fat, so you take the bandage down \\nWhy? Because that way it stays on if you do it the other way it'll drop off it's as simple as that, okay, cover the pad and as you spiral up the arm all you need to do is to cover about two thirds of what you've just done before, just like a spiral, you find the bandages, the more you use those roller bandages of yours the worse they get to control because they lose their, you know, nice and stretchiness, so you just do, cover up the pad at the top, tie always on the top of the arm never underneath here.\",\n",
       " \"Check with your casualty that it's comfortable, yes? and does it feel quite firm for you? Not too tight though? No\\nAnd those bits again, either tuck them in out of the way or better still fold them over and put a big plaster over the top to get them right out the way so no ends are left dangling, remember for most people you're doing this for they'll probably be returning to their place of work, okay, so they need to be safe to return to work, everybody okay on that lot? So let's just recap on the ones you've done this morning, you've done a high sling yes\\nMm\\nyou've used a triangular bandage to cover a wound in the scalp, it's not a chopping block wound right, it's not the chopper in its wound right, it's just a minor wound in the scalp, yes, and that came round and tied at the front, tucked at the back, you used these roller bandages to cover a graze or a wound on the end of an elbow or a knee or the hand, foot and then a straight one up the arm  okay, so a lot of your bandaging is using these little roller bandages with the lint pad and don't forget when you get into the exam do it, don't do it the wrong way round, remember that you look at your bandage and you put the lint onto the wound, not the other way round right, yeah, you put the lint face down onto the wound, okay?\",\n",
       " \"Any questions of anything we've done? All alright on that, yes? We get time to practise these again before the exam? Oh yes , now if by any chanc chance you do have a question in the exam where you're asked you know instead of the wound being on top of the scalp, some clever so and so decides that you're good at improvising and you've got a wound over the top of the eyebrow, the eyebrow's split, okay, so there wouldn't be much good of me going  a minute, pull that there, trying like this round there\\nright, okay, it's not really in the best interest of the casualty is it, right, now what dressing would you apply to that do you think? A plaster\\nPlaster\\nAn eye plaster, an eye pad\\nA an eye pad won't really sop up blood will it? A roller plaster\\nOne of them, of course you will, you use a roller bandage won't you again? In this instance you can put it across the eyebrow, right, across the eyebrow, ask them to hold it and if you're doing a bandage like this the way to keep it on is to have one part of the bandage going above the ear and the next time you go round go below the ear  right, go above the ear and the next time you go round go below the ear  okay and then finally just tie it off, get the idea? Okay, so they may ask you to use something which you haven't necessarily had to do before so that they're really all that the examiner's testing is that you've got a little bit of nous, a little bit of savvy and with what you've got available you can improvise a dressing or use the dressing in a sensible manner so that your casualty's comfortable and you're doing the best you can for them, okay?\",\n",

Anyone want coffee? Anyone staying here and want a cup of coffee? Yes please\\nYeah we'll do one in a minute for you then\\nSo you have the heart of the centre of it, two pumps back to back yes, the major pump or the stronger pump on the left hand side, why? That's where the blood leads by, okay, on that side of the heart the left hand side of the heart it's being pumped and therefore the muscle is a bigger muscle, that's doing the contracting, the blood push out and it relaxes back again and that allows the blood to be sucked back down into the heart, okay, and the next time it's shh, that goes out and then it relaxes down again and the blood sucks back down into the heart, okay so that's what it does, all the muscle can do is that, muscle can only retract and then it relaxes, contract and then it relaxes, that's what the heart's doing all the time, how many beats a minute? Sixty to eighty\\nSixty to eighty you can feel it at pulse point, can't you, here, here, we'll show you so more in a minute, okay? So you know how to check whether the circulatory system is working because if it's working you'll be able to find a pulse  pounding away, yes, that's how you check it, you know the respiratory system's working because if you want to check it what do you want to look for? Rise and fall\\nRise and fall of chest  breath on your hand or your cheek, circulatory system working, pulse, okay? And that's what you're checking, the other side of the heart, the right hand side of the heart with a smaller pump, where's that pumping? Blood out\\nThe lungs\\nBack up to the lungs, okay, now in that little system there, there's just one thing that's interesting to note, when you spoke about circulatory system this morning or yesterday rather with Audrey, you spoke about the blood being always leaving the heart, yes, via the arteries, yes\\nYes\\nand always coming back to the heart\\nBy the veins \\nby the veins , there's always an exception to every rule and the exception to that rule in the case of the heart and the lung connection is the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein, you may not get asked anything about this, but just in case you do it's as well to know, in that instance the flow is reversed, in other words the pulmonary vein takes blood away from the heart and up to the lungs, and the pulmonary artery brings the oxygenated blood back down to the heart from the lungs, if you want to have a look at the diagrams for that and look at it yourself later on, there's no need for you to get concerned or confused about this at all, there's no need. You'll find the little diagram showing you where the pulmonary vein and the pulmonary artery are on page eleven, page eleven if you want to refer to it  right, if you want to look at it in a closer detail tonight that's fine and if you want to see what I'm saying now in a diagrammatic form look on page thirteen  now if you look at that you'll see some, the blue vein blood vessels it's coming out of the right hand side of the heart and if you look at the direction of the arrows, okay, they're going away from the heart, do you agree with me? They come out of the heart and branch like a wishbone, one to each lung, do you see that, now the arrow direction is away from the heart  and that's a vein and you'd expect that to be coming back to the heart wouldn't you? And that's the only time you're going to find it when you're linking the heart and the lungs, now look at those two areas where you've got blood coming back down into the heart, can you see those two wishbones there coming back down into the heart, do you see where I mean, yes? Now those are arteries, that's the pulmonary artery  but it's coming back to the heart  okay, that's the only time you're going to find the rule reversed, arteries leave the heart, veins come back to the heart, and the only time that rule is reversed is when you're linking the heart and the lungs through the pulmonary vein and the pulmonary artery, however, they are still carrying, the arteries are still carrying oxygen charged blood, yes, because it's come fresh from the lungs so it's still carrying nice red lovely oxygenated blood, yes, even though it's coming back into the heart, that is because it's come fresh from the lungs and the vein although it's going in the opposite direction the way you normally expect it, is still carrying the old rotten, you know, used up blood, because it's going back to the lungs to be recharged, do you understand it alright? That's the only time it'll be reversed \\nCan you just say that bit about the pulmonary in the vein and the pulmonary in the wee artery again please\\nThe pulmonary artery comes back into the heart, the pulmonary vein goes away from the heart \\nVein goes home \\nback up to the lungs, they are linking the heart and the lungs\\nYeah, I've written that down\\nalright and if you look at the diagram on page thirteen and you look at the little arrow diagram you'll see that it gives it quite nice and clearly there  is that alright? Just wanted to clarify that little point, so you know the organs that make up the circulatory system, you know how to check it, you know the one slight difference than what you normally expect veins and arteries to be doing  okay? Now we need to talk a little bit about what happens when the veins or the arteries or the capillaries for that matter, the veins, the arteries or the capillaries have a leak in them, they become broken, now you already know that the circulatory system is a closed system and that the blood can only do its job if it's being transported within that system, once the blood comes outside of that system then it's lost the circulation and it cannot perform its proper function any more, in other words the body's losing its blood, okay, what condition do we call it when the circulatory system stops working properly? Shock\\nShock, do you understand the difference between the loss of pressure and loss of volume, volume would be when liquid was leaking out, coming out of the blood vessels, okay, pressure would be when the heart itself, the pump itself had failed or was not working properly, failed completely or was not working properly, do you understand the difference? Obviously eventually if people keep on leaking blood their pressure will fall  but you could have a situation where there's not a single drop of blood yet lost to the system and yet the person's in shock because the blood's not being circulated properly off the heart, not a drop of blood lost to the system, but insufficient pressure, so shock can be caused by either of those two things, failure of the circulatory system because the pressure of the volume drops dangerously low, okay, you did a lot of work on what the person looks like, yes  you as the casu you as the first aider will see this person in front of you, what will they be like?\",\n",

P C Raymond Hall was shot last November in North London when he tried to arrest Kelly and an accomplice who were in a lorry which was found to be packed with more than three tonnes of explosives. The intuition of two unarmed policemen thwarted the I R A's attempt to plant the biggest ever bomb in the capital. On patrol in North London in the early hours of the morning, they became suspicious about a seven tonne lorry. Part of the number plate was obscured and it had been badly resprayed. It was hardly surprising the two occupants made such a quick getaway when stopped. Three and a half tonnes of home made explosives were inside, needing only seconds to prime. The device was three times the size of the Baltic Exchange bomb and would have devastated buildings within three hundred yards. Giving chase down a side road, one of the policemen challenged two men. One of them pulled out a revolver aiming it inches away from P C Ray Hall's nose. He ducked instinctively and the bullet grazed his head. He felt a second shot hit him in the back and knock him off his feet. He survived to tell an Old Bailey court of his miraculous escape. P C Hall, a former Royal Engineer, who served in the Falklands war before joining the police, said he was convinced he was going to die. Police believe Patrick Kelly was the driver of the lorry in North London rather than the gunman. He had an unlikely background for a terrorist. With convictions in England for gross indecency and importuning. Although he was found guilty in Dublin of kidnapping, he was not a known I R A man. But he and the suspect who escaped, were intent on repeating the mayhem of the City of London explosion eight months earlier. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Leonard told Kelly, the public needed protection from him. His bomb would have caused enormous damage and more importantly, could have killed anyone in the area. The judge said P C Hall's bravery in preventing the attack deserved the highest commendation. Er I joined the police five years ago with the intention of helping and serving the public and I think er last year I done it. And today the public have er returned their gesture in honour of me in the returning of the guilty verdict. What I done on that night was no more than any other police officer does or would do in the same situation. As he spoke, Patrick Kelly was driven away to begin his twenty five year sentence. Neil Bennet, B B C News, at the Old Bailey. A twenty one year old student has been cleared at the Old Bailey of raping another student after a drunken Christmas party. Austin Donnellan went on trial at his own insistence because he said he was unhappy with the way the disciplinary committee at London University's King's College was dealing with the case. Cleared of rape, Austin Donnellan stepped out of the Old Bailey and stepped into an angry scum of photographers and reporters fighting to get close to him. His case, involving an allegation that he raped another student after going out with her, has attracted wide media attention. Almost inaudible in the crush, he thanked everyone who'd helped him in the case. I'm especially grateful to my friends who supported me by giving evidence. Mr Donnellan who's twenty one and the woman were students at King's College in London. The court heard how last Christmas they both went to a dance, the woman got very drunk and they ended up back at her room. The court was told she'd alleged she was unconscious when he had sex with her. But he told the court it was quite the opposite. She was not a dead piece of meat, he said, but very energetic in bed. She encouraged sex. Donnellan said that if at any time she'd wanted him to stop, he would have done. The court heard the police became involved in the case at Mr Donnellan's insistence. The woman student and King's College wanted the matter dealt with by the University's disciplinary committee. But Mr Donnellan claimed they wanted him to admit a lesser charge to get him out of the college quietly. He said he refused to accept this because he was not guilty of anything. The college were going to try the issue before a pr private almost secret little disciplinary committee containing academics and students. And he didn't want that. He wanted it tried out in the open and for his name to be cleared. Decisively and that's happened now. Mr Donnellan's tutor said the case was important because it dealt with such a sensitive issue. The key point to me was as soon as he said n as she said, No, he stopped. In my book that's not rape. And it seems not in the jury's book either and I'm very glad of it. Moved by the verdict, Mr Donnellan's mother said she was proud he'd taken the case to the police in order to clear himself. The family are now celebrating at a secret location. Triona Holden, B B C News, the Old Bailey. Women's groups have responded angrily to the jury's decision to clear Austin Donnellan of rape. And the case has again raised the question of what constitutes consent to sex. Scenes like this leading to brief encounters between couples who may scarcely know each other, can some say, cause confusion about sexual etiquette. Is it reasonable for a woman to invite a man to her bedroom, even to undress and get into bed, and still reserve the right to refuse penetrative sex? It shouldn't be, Okay, we're in bed together, we're gonna have sex whether you want to or not. If someone changes their mind, they have that prerogative. Er and if someone isn someone might be getting into bed and and not intending to have sex then that's fine as well. However others of an older generation say women should know the risks they take once they take their clothes off. The male sex drive being what it is, the chances of his being able to stop are less perhaps than she realizes. There is a point for many men which they regard as the point of no return. And as I say, if they are perfect men, maybe they can take a deep breath and stop just like that. But some men can't. Students at London University were almost unanimous today in saying a couple going to bed together didn't necessarily mean the woman consents to sex. If the woman has asked him to stop, if she has changed her mind and doesn't want to go through with with the action o of intercourse or whatever, then the man should stop. Everybody's very confused by it. Most sex is probably nearer to rape, particularly in one's early years. And we might like to give credit for And I think it's really hard to learn to read the signs. Both parties, the man and the woman should always be in control of the situation and if for some reason they want things to stop, should have the authority and the power to do that. But some were less sure. I think if a girl got into bed with you er no clothes, I think the intention to have sex is very clear. I'm against rape but definitely if a woman er goes to a man's bed then it's quite er er sensible that if a man expects to have sex with that woman. Simple as that. However, social historians say couples having non-penetrative sex goes back a long way. A practice called bundling was quite common in the past. With an unmarried couple in a bed with a bolster down the middle. They'd just be in their underwear and er it's er there's certain evidence that they engaged in what we would call heavy petting nowadays. Some women say the old idea that a man is uncontrollable past a certain point is absurd. Consent from a woman needs to be gained at every stage during sex, even once a couple are in bed. But others say that this definition of rape will undermine the progress made so far in getting the courts to take rape seriously. It was only two years ago that rape by husbands became illegal. Polly Toynbee. The Prime Minister has again made it clear he has no intention of scrapping plans to put V A T on fuel and power. During Prime Minister's questions. the Labour leader John Smith urged the government to abandon what he called these foolish proposals. But Mr Major said extension of V A T was a vital part of policies to reduce public borrowing, earlier the Prime Minister presided over a cabinet discussion of the options for next month's budget. The cabinet's discussion was hampered by deep uncertainty about the strength of the recovery. Views differed on how much any increase in taxes could threaten the move out of recession. The most cheerful remarks seemed to have been made about the health of Michael Heseltine, who was making his first appearance at the cabinet since his heart attack. The Prime Minister led the welcome, there were cries of, hear hear and a ritual banging of the cabinet table. The chancellor kept his cards very close to his chest. He intends to wait until the last moment before making the vital decision on taxes. Mr Major told the commons that the recovery does seem to have taken root. And he made clear that despite the government's small majority, they would be prepared to take difficult decisions about how to reduce the enormous government deficit. The reality is that we need to cope with the fiscal deficit and we have the courage to do so. The labour leader opened up an Autumn offensive against the extension of V A T.\\nDoes the Prime Minister have the remotest appreciation of the overwhelming hostility throughout this nation to imposing V A T on domestic fuel. In addition to its obvious unfairness, is there not now evidence that the governments tax increases impel consumer confidence and any hope of a recovery. In these circumstances will the Prime Minister now abandon these foolish proposals. Well I think the er right honourable gentleman knows for both I and my right honourable friend the chancellor have made the position quite clear, that the extra value added tax is a vital part of our policies to get public borrowing down but that we will be offering help to people who are vulnerable. If the tax Madam speaker, is as obnoxious as the right honourable gentleman claims, then why did the Labour conference vote and I quote, For a general shift in taxation towards energy resource use? What is that other than VAT? The unpopularity of the V A T increase was a key factor in the Liberal Democrats victory in the Christchurch by-election. The government's majority is now down to seventeen. Getting a tough budget through the commons won't be easy. John Sergeant, B B C News, Westminster. The chancellor's team of independent economic advisors, the so- called seven wise men, have urged him not to do anything in his budget next month to damage the recovery. They've called for the gradual introduction of tax increases balanced by a reduction in interest rates. The chancellor's plans are always the subject of intense speculation as budget day approaches. At the conference of town planners today, he expressed the treasury's customary disdain for most of it. Strong rumours  that I'm about to tax everything that moves and doesn't move. And this has er been an experience of every chancellor before. Er most of the accounts of what I'm discussing er are pretty well near fiction. Er a and er they will certainly remain secret until I produce my budget. But the rumours reflect merely what everyone knows, events are conspiring to make this budget a particularly difficult one. The chancellor's major budget headache is that the government is fifty billion pounds in the red. To reduce that borrowing figure, he could cut spending. But the overall expenditure total for next year has already been agreed and it's unlikely that much more could be pared from it. That leaves Mr Clarke with the option of raising taxes. But higher taxes mean that consumers and businesses have less money to spend. And that could damage the prospects for recovery. In their thrice yearly report, the treasury's panel of independent advisors express concern about the economies fragility. They're against large tax increases next month. Instead they want to see a more gradual approach backed by a cut in interest rates. We do think that there is a need to increase tax receipts further over the medium term from nineteen ninety five onwards by about one percentage point of G D P, about seven billion pounds. But we do not think the chancellor should raise taxes much next year because the recovery is too weak to accept that. Figures out today suggested those fears about recovery are well founded. Consumer spending appears to be slowing. The panel believe lower interest rates are needed to boost flagging demand. But they think the chancellor will have no choice but to increase taxes in the longer term as the economic climate improves. The message to the chancellor is a clear one, don't tax now, tax later. But he knows that later means closer to the next election. And while it may be economically desirable to raise taxes then, it might prove politically impossible. Gerry Baker, B B C News, as the treasury. About a hundred Greek Cypriot demonstrators booed and jeered the Queen today as she was handed the keys of Nicosia. The divided capital of Cyprus. The demonstrators want Britain to apologize for the executions of nine men who fought for the island's independence in the fifties. Here's our Middle Eastern correspondent Michael Macmillan. In Nicosia's old city, a couple of hundred right wing Eoka supporters chanted, The Queen is a traitor, we don't want you here. Inside the walls at Famagusta Gate, the shouting could still be heard as the Queen was presented with the key to the city by the Mayor of Nicosia. Those opposed to the Queen's visit had demanded that she be refused the honour both here and in Limassol. It was an uncomfortable affair, the Mayor used it as an occasion to condemn what he called the Turkish occupation of the North of the island and Douglas Hurd looked on clearly anxious that the whole thing be wound up as soon as possible. The chaos continued as they reversed the Queen's Rolls Royce for a quick departure.\",\n",
       " \"Her press secretary looked worried. As did her driver. And Mr Hurd who's angered the Greek Cypriots by his plans to meet the Turkish Cypriot leader, declined to comment. He was booed as well. The Queen emerged to more protests but finally forced a smile before she was driven away. Elsewhere in Nicosia there were several arrests and in one incident police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd. It was a day in which the Queen was anxious to leave the past behind and to the end she made a point of meeting Argentinian soldiers who form part of the U N contingent here. It has been a difficult day for the Queen and tonight she's been snubbed following the decision by the municipality of Limassol not to present her with the keys to the town. The palace is playing it all down but clearly this visit is not going according to plan. Michael Macmillan, B B C News, Nicosia, Cyprus. The time is six sixteen and still to come, big supermarket chains line up to try to stop American style shopping in Britain. The supermarkets say warehouse club shopping should be subject to the same planning laws as they are. And Benazir Bhutto is back as Pakistan's Prime Minister for the second time. A doctor who gave cannabis to her sick daughter has been cleared of criminal charges at Liverpool Crown Court. Dr Anne  denied supplying cannabis. She said she gave it to her daughter because she believed it was the only drug which could help alleviate her condition. She said she'd been following a higher moral law. The trial lasted a week. Dr  always insisting that she wasn't campaigning for the legalization of cannabis. For ten years, Anne  who ran a G P practice from her home at Wallasey, tried to obstruct her daughter taking cannabis because she thought it would do her harm. The court heard that Lucy who is thirty three has suffered a serious and intractable illness for thirteen years. Eventually her mother became convinced cannabis could help after reading evidence from doctors in the United States. The  s' family priest says the conflict between medicine and law put a tremendous strain on the doctor. As a doctor she would be i in the dilemma of of trying to give her daughter something which er is not allowed, and yet as a as a doctor she could prescribe other things for other people and here she is as a mother with her own child in her own house, unable to to do anything very much for her. It took the jury less than an hour to clear Dr . What she did she did clearly for the benefit of her daughter who was unwell, as any normal natural mother would in the circumstances. What what are you going to do now? I want to go and have a gin and tonic. A double gin. Dr  's defence had been legally unusual, that of necessity. She believed that supplying cannabis to her daughter was morally right in the medical circumstances. John Thorne, B B C News, Liverpool. Two men who ran Britain's biggest ecstasy smuggling gang have each been jailed for twenty four years at Maidstone Crown Court. The men, Ronald Maine and Ronald Johnson, headed an international operation, smuggling drugs worth and estimated fifty eight million pounds. Two accomplices were also jailed for their part in the operation. The supermarket chains, Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway have applied to the high court to try to stop the opening in this country of an American style warehouse club. Costco is due to open a club at Thurrock in Essex next month and is able to cut prices by keeping overheads low. It's classified as a wholesaler but the supermarkets say Costco should be subject to the same planning rules as retailers. This is the development that's upsetting Britain's supermarket giants. A huge warehouse that's nearing completion at Thurrock in Essex, and which offers the kind of discounts already enjoyed by millions of Americans. Like this Boston store, warehouse clubs are open to members only and though they're pitched at businesses, individuals can join too if they can show they've a steady income and pay their thirty dollar subscription. For that they get access to anything from food to car tyres. Mostly well known brands at up to fifty percent less than they'd pay elsewhere. I need to have three of four hundred dollars because before you even get through the store, you just buy. I believe that the large supermarkets have had it too good for too long. They've had tremendous power in the market place with no competition. American supermarkets have hit back by cutting many of their prices and printing more money off coupons. They save this woman over twenty pounds a trip. Like our own superstores, they stock a much wider range of goods than the warehouses, but experts say supermarkets in Britain should be worried if the clubs do take off here. Unless they dramatically change the way they do business, they're going to have problems, they won't go away certainly. I mean people are always going to want to want the convenience of er driving to a nearby established supermarket, but their profit margins will decline. But the big three supermarket chains deny their high court action is to kill off Costco. They say they simply want clubs to be subject to the same planning restrictions they face. They're promoting themselves to a very significant extent on the basis that they're selling at cheaper prices to the public. That means in my book that they're er doing retailing. Er if they're retailers then they should er comply with retail regulations as does any other retailer in the United Kingdom. Costco has already put in a second application to answer some of the criticisms.\",\n",

Benazir Bhutto has been sworn in as Prime Minister of Pakistan for the second time after a decisive victory in the country's parliament over her greatest rival, the Muslim League leader, Nawa Shariff. But her Pakistan people's party must wait until tomorrow to find out if it has the power that comes with control of the key state of Punjab. After days of coalition building, Benazir Bhutto could only wait to see if it had paid off. Nawa Shariff lost the election and he's lost the battle for the independence and members of minority parties who hold the balance of power. The count was a hundred and twenty one for Benazir Bhutto, seventy two for Nawa Shariff. And from the Prime Minister's chair, a word for the loser. Pakistani voters watched the drama unfold. . a short drive from the capital, is one of the Punjab cities where Nawa Shariff is strongest. His control of the Punjab Assembly neutralized Benazir Bhutto's last administration. The former military dictator General Zir-El-Haaq is still revered here. His son sits in the National Assembly for Nawa Shariff's party. We have all come out with er with the worst er scenario ever er in the er democratic history of Pakistan. And any government which is going to be formed in the centre I don't think it is going to last for too long. Benazir Bhutto says that after the summer of turmoil in Pakistan, this could be the last chance for parliamentary democracy. Everyone knows that if this time round, there is political instability, it may be a long time before Pakistan gets yet another chance at election. But for now the army is prepared to watch and wait. As Benazir Bhutto was sworn in the news came in that her choice for speaker had been elected in Punjab. The first indication that tomorrow she could take the state. Benazir Bhutto looks to be strong but it's a coalition of convenience not conviction, in a country where politics follows the rules of war, opposition means nothing, winning is everything. Tonight Benazir Bhutto is winning. David Loin, B B C News, Islamabad. The Welsh Secretary, John Redwood, told the House of Commons today that the Welsh Development Agency had tightened up its procedures in the wake of a highly critical report. In July the Commons public accounts committee attacked the W D A for its management practices and for making unauthorized redundancy payments worth more than a million pounds. The Agency's chief executive has since resigned, another director left today and two other directors have been disciplined. Our industry correspondent Stephen Evans reports. Why have forty five Japanese companies chose Wales as their European launch pad? The Agency has painted the brightest picture of Wales around the world. Spending a hundred and seventy one million pounds a year to draw countless foreign firms. But the image was tarnished by the public accounts committee report. Neil Smith, guilty of fraud, became marketing director and interviewed models in a hotel. Redundancy pay of one point four million pounds was said to be excessive. The Agency's chief executive resigned yesterday. One other official has gone, two demoted or reprimanded. Procedures are to be tightened. The independent panel that I appointed in July as you are aware, reported yesterday. Its recommendations are severe. However they are comprehensive. And it has given the board opportunity to take the necessary action. In Parliament this afternoon the debate was over where responsibility lies. It is clear from the report that my predecessors were not to blame and that the primary responsibility lay at exept executive level in the W D A and I suggest honourable members opposite  read the report . Is it any wonder given such casual leadership from the Welsh Office, that standards in the Agency itself fell to such unacceptable levels. This man's done a fabulous job. The Welsh Development Agency, fabulous job. But the Prime Minister of the time's favourite W D A head Dr Gwynne Jones has now gone. As Wales seeks growth, the dilemma for the Agency is how to get a commercial go-getting mentality on public money with public control. The government wants devolved decision making. But then tight audits.\",\n",
       " \"Labour fears privatization. Stephen Evans, B B C News. A bill to grant posthumous pardons to all three hundred and seven British soldiers who were executed in the first world war, has gained a formal first reading in the house of commons. The MP who introduced the bill said many of the men who were shot for cowardice were in fact suffering from shell shock. A village churchyard across the muddy fields from the Somme bears testimony to the British soldiers found to have failed their country. Condemned as cowards, deserters, they were shot by their own side in a war which wiped out much of a generation. In the first terrible hours of battle, twenty thousand died as they advanced into the German's heavy artillery and machine guns. One suicidal attack followed another every soldier wavered between courage and fear. In a regiment which had two men shot for cowardice, Reg Glen, now a hundred, says those executed didn't deserve dishonour or death. It was shell shock. There was a er no doubt it was a disease. And it could attack anybody. And er more likely to be people of a nervous disposition. Those men who finally couldn't face going over the top from these trenches on the Somme, met with summary justice. They had little chance to defend themselves at their court marshal, they weren't properly represented and there was very little right of appeal. The firing squads met at dawn. Just behind these front lines. Corporal Harry Farr was shot for cowardice in October nineteen sixteen. At the Somme memorial to those with no known grave, his granddaughter wants a posthumous pardon, to finally purge the shame her family had sought to hide for three generations. My mother didn't know until she was in her mid forties. And she only learnt from somebody else that her father had been executed. It was a dreadful stigma. MP Andrew McKinley says records at the Imperial war museum clearly show the brutality of battlefield justice. His bill now goes forward for a second reading but stands a slim chance of becoming law. Executed May nineteen sixteen. Dear oh dear. The families of those shot at dawn, still hope that Ministers who say they won't rewrite history, may yet change their minds and give every victim of the great war, the same respect. Mike Donkin, B B C News, The Somme.

You know, I mean they've still got a couple of books each and I've bought three \\nSwing \\nthe swing and I've bought them a couple of wooden puzzles where you pick the bits up  so, I thought well then I'll call it a day there, and that'll be that \\nWell this is this is it Gilly cos I mean\\nOh you can keep going though  totally over the top  I thought well Joseph's was twelve ninety nine and Ben's was fourteen nineteen ninety nine and that's just tough that I've got you know, I can't get Charlotte's any cheaper than that, but, I mean they're not gonna know how much I've, they're not gonna say well you've got five pound more than what I have cos they're not of that age so, that's how I've left it, that's what I'm gonna do, I'll get her the circus and then they can swap them over and Joseph will be happy that he got something on wheels\\nYeah\\nI said to Robert \\nHe has got something on wheels from us\\nyeah, I said to Rob you can't keep buying them learning toys, they've gotta\\nYeah \\nplay as well haven't they? well that helps them as much really don't it?

Mm, mm, I mean, its probably got to the st \\nSometimes I look \\nits probably got to the stage where you want glasses all the time now, just you know erm \\nYeah \\nI mean that doesn't help as well, I know  Sainsbury's or Tesco's and you have to keep taking them off and putting them on\\nYes. that doesn't help cos your eyes are not having time to adjust erm without the glasses before you put them back on again .

Ropers, they don't know, well they know I'm coming in some time today, but they don't know when\\nYeah\\nso it's\\nCrazy absolutely crazy\\nYeah\\nwell I\\nIf this is where I\\nyou know what I've been trying to get hold of a couple of one of these  you know the phones, the phones that Donald's got\\nOh not the, I thought you meant\\nyeah\\nYeah\\nwhat for yourself? Yeah\\nI don't like it\\nDon't you? I don't, no\\nCertainly faster than the\\nI've got\\nI dunno erm, no I don't like them at all it's in fact I'm not even impressed with it I mean you look at the people with G six hundred and you look at the fifty six\\nand they're not a\\nFifty six hundred? No  oh you think well that's not an executive phone that's just er a phone with a couple of buttons on it\\nYeah\\nwell you know what the six hundreds are don't ya? No\\nThat's the white one with the, with the green L E D display it's got the calculator on it \\nno, that's the fifty six hundred, the same model as O S D T\\nYeah\\nthe erm, the six hundred has got a separate power supply  little black eighteen volt car\\nlooks like a mark two executive station, instead of being L C D it's L E D display, green L E D\\nRider's got one, you know as you walk in\\nOh yeah, the\\non the right\\nOh that thing\\nYeah, did you like them? They're one of the best we've ever done, I tell you what\\nYou know there's quite a few about, I've seen them, you know\\nMm\\nmust of taken about ten years to make\\nEh? its external goes in the back  far superb\\nYeah well, I put the paperwork in there and I\\nwell I always keep it in the box so I don't get mixed up then, I don't start calling the mark three key board\\nI wonder why it doesn't work\\nBruising quite well innit? Yes   your neighbours could do with a lesson in parking\\nOh  this one or that one? Well I think it's Gary  I mean he's left a gap there's room for just about a car either side of him\\nYeah, oh I know  I've said time and time again to them if you park up a bit, you know  that house\\nhis driveway that he put up and er he just about misses where the tree was, but he's chopped all the tree down so he can have his grass, I dunno, well even if it meant just supporting the piece of something above his car so he don't get any sap on it or ought\\nYeah well that's a point yeah there's something\\nI didn't thought of that \\nIt gets me how people drive a car sometimes with a\\nto look through\\noh yeah\\nWell, well see how it goes, but erm  I don't, the thing is you see they can teach you so much about laying different bonds and making patterns and doing portholes and things like that, that'll be handy to know, but obviously you're not gonna learn that until much later on\\nMm, what about arches with a keystone? Yeah they'll probably teach you that, yeah more than likely, yeah, you'd of touch the chimney flue, part of it, but the trouble is the qualifications have fall beyond of what I want to do anyway and considering it's gonna cost a couple of grand to get it\\nYeah\\nit's not worth it because I'm not gonna sort of get myself into a position where I'm only likely, where in other words get a job as a bricklayer\\nYeah\\nso it's really not worth getting qualifications on reflection so  I want to do a bit of work you see, build myself a reputation that sort of thing\\nYeah\\nand then do the odd wall, that's fine\\nyeah, I'm tempted to go around now looking at brickwork now\\nMm\\ngetting ideas\\nMm\\nand probably incorporate one or two, can't do that on the garage though cos it won't, it's gonna be out of character\\nMm, yeah, but er \\nthe, Russ' erm, done, well he's already got a wall, just make it a bit bigger, an existing wall just taking it around the back so gonna do that in the summer I'll erm, well in the spring, yeah gives er a bit, a bit of a practice\\nMm  what's Russell like any good? Yeah, he's quicker than I am, but he don't seem to be as accurate\\nYeah\\nyou know, by the time I've got about three bricks down, he's two\\nhe's not as accurate as I am, no, but what I do I, I point mine up as well \\nYeah\\ncos that way it gives me a bit more incentive, it gives me an idea of how it's looking\\nYeah\\nwhereas Russ just throws it together and don't bother pointing it, and to me that is incentive, I mean you don't do it when you build it I know you don't, when you're earning, it's a bit of er, a mark, a guide to how you do it. And er, certainly take advantage of the half price\\nYeah \\nthing , for twenty four quid for a hundred and eight weeks, you've got, you've got to take that, think it's coming on and learning, got the thing in there, start to progress it might get you, it's gonna get to the point where he says right, you know you've got them just about to sort of labour it's, you know, accurately with a fair amount of speed now we'll start sort of now being a bit adventurous, gonna get a lot more interesting. You sees like cutting, you know you see these walls that are like that and they sort of go down like that and join a pillar and do the same again, just, instead of doing that you lay the soldiers across the top and you, you've got to sort of cut the bricks in between ain't ya? Mm\\nCutting bricks is another fault of Russ, it's all commonsense actually if you think about it, I mean actually we've drove round at night looking at people's walls and things like that and some were absolutely appalling, they've obviously paid money to have that done,so you, you, you can see it don't have to be absolutely perfect\\nMm\\nalthough I'm, that'll only do for me\\nYeah, these floors are impossible to\\nyeah, he's had his drive took across his back you know that there\\nmm\\nThey do it individual\\ndon't they? Mm\\nyeah, there's one good there but, erm what they do, is they do it in concrete you know, but they can make it look like bricks\\nYeah \\nthey colour the concrete\\nOh dear\\nand they, they put the concrete down, then they get this thing to put on it and it, it sort of moulds it\\nYeah\\nit just textures it like\\nMm\\nlooks like bricks, another one they can make it look like welsh slate and things like that\\nChrist\\nYeah  yeah it's quite er  What are those\\naudio monitors? Monitor audio yeah\\nMonitor audi \\nYeah it's sort of an L in shape of a O we've got\\nOh yeah\\noh\\ndid ya? Yeah, what I like about, what I liked about them was that they were dead flat like, you know if you, imagine it a sweet the weight for a sweet were from say ten ounces to twenty kilos\\nYeah\\nyou have some speakers if you, if you do a run like that you'll hit a pitch were it resonate with the speaker\\nYeah\\nI mean most speakers have got resonate point, some, most of them are quite low\\nYeah\\nbut these, there are nothing, you know, there is no intonation at all \\nYeah\\nit was just everything that you heard was\\nAs it should be\\nYeah like crisp you know\\nYeah\\nYeah, I mean I don't know how powerful they were that, I mean he weren't, he weren't belting on those but there was, he was playing loud enough to appreciate with its own you know \\nYeah \\noh it went really well, how much does it cost? He was on about something about\\napparently monitors for some reason the most monitor cost, monitor class speakers\\nYeah\\nbut they're infinite in there er\\nYeah I've heard that\\nYeah\\nYeah\\nthat's what he was saying as long as you don't  what was he saying? Some it you have to do\\nI think one rule that you have to follow and as long as you follow that particular rule then they can handle infinite amount of power, don't make sense to me\\nNo \\ncos there are some\\ndirect drive aren't they, you know a lot of them passed a couple don't they there's a\\nMm\\nan output stage\\nMm\\nand a really big\\nI think it goes through that way, but, I think these are direct drive, but it's actually a straight piece in\\nyou know\\nIs it? Yeah, straight into the back of the speaker so you can actually make the speaker do what you want like\\nYeah\\nto within reason like\\nYeah, so the amp has to be match, match it then? Or do you have to, have som \\nYou might, yeah , the trouble is it's gotta match down to be exact or\\nMm, is his amp like that? Yeah, his amp's got, yeah his amp was built for this particular type of er, I can't remember what bloody amp he's got now  there were no, no particularly flash like, you know, er, er, they were saying something to do with clipping, I think it's to do with clipping they saying the power up, the power point's alright as long as you don't  clip, because what happens is if the wave forms doing that\\nYeah\\nyou gain er an R M S\\nwith power\\nYeah\\nbut if you, if you actually clipping\\nYeah\\nthe speaker's actually being pushed by the amp and staying out\\nMm\\nyou're practically burning the coil out so it's just a dri , a straight forward plattening \\nMm\\nit can't handle any more so you got a, a\\nplaying into the coil and it's not doing anything so it's just, just\\nin you know\\nYeah\\nI think that's the point what he's making  and that's what actually you know does the lamp damage that  mm \\nDo you speak good for what they are? Yeah they are \\nTo say erm\\nthat's what bothers me about it you ain't \\nYou just ain't got the power though\\nWell the thing is to buy summat\\nlike it you know, you, you can spend a lot of bloody money just to try and improve \\nThat's right \\nthem, you know\\nthat's right, well the thing is these are, I was looking at the power today I, er not read it properly in the past, there only four rounds, these have got to be A, if you want both A and B on\\nYeah\\nyou've got to have A tons\\nYeah\\nif you have, cos what, what happens is if you put A and B it erm  it parallels them off, so if you've got two sets of four amps it's in two rows \\nOh yeah \\nso it's no good cos it's four to A zones, you can run four providing you only have that channel \\nCan't say that\\nI suppose you could, but it's got A and B outputs you see\\nYeah\\nbut it says here nominal input twenty five watts R M S  here it says maximum what forty watts\\nyeah, but that's a hundred  I mean you can tell, I've tried it, it is, I, I ain't even had it half way and it's, you can tell it's overdriving them\\nYeah\\nis that a four to eight, O drive as well, does it say four to eight games? It does, it's hundred watts, yeah it says you can use anything between four and eight Os\\nYeah\\nbut if you want them both, if you want both A and B on you've got to have a \\nYeah \\nbut er it's measure hundred, hundred watts R M S into eight Os\\nSo it's \\nDoes he want fruit juice? No he won't\\nyeah\\nWhat do you think to the board game on the back? Oh, I thought it quite witty actually, yeah\\nMiracle Squares  I think there's a lot of thought gone into it you know, it can't be easy to re er to, to just dream up a game  erm, I like the one about you go to the last supper and the waiter spills soup on your trousers, the waiter, ha   tell you else about the Marx brothers an'all, the waiter is er the king of Snowdonia and it's Groucho Marx, the, they've got this massive hall, and er  these big steps leading down into it you know and as, as they're coming in there's somebody at the top and Ann says who's, who's walking in and they walk down the stairs you know and Mr and Mrs and the king has you know  and he says oh the king Snowdonia is about to arrive, he should be here any minute now, he should be here dead on this time you know, he gets these big fanfare trumpets up da, da, da, da, the king of Snowdonia, and there's nothing and all of a sudden it flashes to Groucho Marx and then he's in bed with\\nand, and they do it about four or five times, you know, the king of Snowdonia, welcome to see and all the bugles going you know all of a sudden he appears in the middle of the picture he says oh I've come through the back door\\nYeah  don't know how many films they made do you? No, they used to have a very good thing didn't they at weekends for\\nDid they? Yeah a few years ago\\nThey usually have them at erm Christmas time don't they, usually have a couple of Marx Brothers' films on\\nYeah \\nSay you can buy them films if you want\\nYeah I, I, looking what it says in erm, rather than take the load\\nYeah\\ncos they're not, they're not, get round to it otherwise  erm, I'm hoping they\\ndo you know how long it lasts? A couple of hours\\nDoes it? Mm  Dave Allen's on that as well the only bit, I think I've set it for the Beast Master ain't I? Yeah\\nYeah well when  right at the beginning of the tape is Dave Allen, but that's adult\\nYeah\\nso, don't let the kids watch that. Yeah \\nDo you like him? Sometimes yeah\\nMm \\nOnly now and again though\\nMm \\nOh dear\\nWhat's the time then? Still got the timesheets to do yet \\nI've got a load of paperwork to do tomorrow\\nHave ya? what actually paper or the\\nBills er, customer bills\\nOh\\nsort out which bits are\\nyou know\\nMm, I've only got one charge me this week, you don't seem to get many now\\nOh\\nI just have one connect, connect to\\nprogramme, programme one, ha only\\nget all these programmes for some reason, somebody allowed for it when they put the system in, mind you still have to check it I suppose but checked through it, tested it, took me about five minutes, still a minimum charge of an hour\\ntry and include the customers into\\nas much as possible\\nMm\\nI'm giving er a reduced rate for a while, so if anything goes wrong we foot the bill\\nOh yeah\\nsay like we're moving some equipment from one place to another\\nYeah \\nwe do all the disconnect cable and\\nyeah\\ncheck it out for them and they want a quote, say it takes two blokes an hour each\\nYeah\\nquote them a couple of hours, we drop the normal rate, you know by say thirty percent to start\\nYeah\\nand wrap it up into a package and say you know if anything goes wrong and it takes four hours then you\\nthe same, yeah, cos if, didn't the Co-Op move or something?\",\n",
       " \"Oh yeah they did er \\nAnd they fell flat on their face didn't they? Yeah, they did a move like\\nYeah\\nit cost them a bomb that did \\nWell we went to a solicitor's office, what was it Friday morning? Thursday morning? Friday morning? And erm  they'd moved the kit, got the electricians to do it and it took, it took three fuses when they did it, I mean the extensions fused on that particular system, the data pairs fused\\nMm\\nand er they had to call us in, well Dick went out and er I think it was actually two separate visits so they must of, cos they're refurbishing the place you see so they must of moved into one office and thought oh you know this don't work, move into another office the day after, well this don't work either and he, he actually did two separate visits, whether they'll actually bill them for it I don't know , but I mean it's a minimum of an hour in both cases so\\nMm\\nyou know two calls, two hours\\nMm  I dunno what we get asked to do you know, I mean in some cases we can handle everything like pulling out bloody cables after other receive in that kind of thing\\nYeah\\nOh I had one bloody customer see if I can quote him to a complete relocate, it was only a bloody er systems, probably no taller than that speaker\\nYeah\\nbut it's like a P C a bit \\nYeah \\nlike a flat P C but a power system one \\nOh them sitting on the desk? Yeah\\nMm\\nbe like, be a bit lonely you know something like that, that kind of line\\nMm\\nthat width\\nwanted it relocated with all the cabling and that, you know er to the terminals\\nYeah\\nin the same building? No to another site\\nMm\\nthis is why it's\\nyou know\\nYeah\\nI says if we do it for you it'll cost you a fortune, he said\\nyeah\\ncos a lot of it's bloody play by ear you know the contract's \\nYeah \\nput together\\nYeah\\nif, they can't, they've got this system when they can key it in you know and comes up with a price, but it's that bloody strip\\nYeah\\nyou're better off just putting a bloody\\nmm\\nmm\\nNow is the time for the engineering man that is it  yeah\\nSo you, it, he got you to move it in the end? Yeah I didn't do it in myself like, but we did, we did end, end up with\\nyeah. I went to some er, what was it, estate agents erm Alan Orwood on King Street, I says to them er, what was it, want an extra extension put in who do you go to? I says well where did you get the system from? Communications, I said well you can either go to them or you can got to, we'll do it for ya, so it's really up to you, he says well who's the cheapest? I says well I don't know to be honest, I says I don't deal with them, but we were talking about Mercury these cross-routing got one of these systems here\\nMm\\nand then I said have you got, are these cross-routing it? He says no, he says we've thought about it, I says well you really ought to have it I says if you're dial dialling a lot of erm, cos they dial a lot of these insurance companies and er mortgage lenders, the head offices, they're always out in Ottingham, I said the Mercury pin number only cost you seven pound fifty a year, I says you think you can save that in a week  so er  ha  so erm he was on about it, he says who's the cheapest for that? I says well we, we put erm a mailshot out for four hundred and ninety nine pound, cos the software and all the re-programming involved, I says Ford Communications followed it up, you know, they put a mailshot out for two hundred and ninety nine pound all in, oh he says I think I'd rather prefer G P T to them\\nMm\\nwhich is erm now I'm dealing all the same company, maintenance and everything\\nMm\\nso er we've got to hang on to it\\nMm  surprising how, especially the, the bigger companies as well they tend to want to do things\\nYeah, it's only a small estate agent\\nYeah  it's, it's surprising how many companies want to like leave that side of things to un \\nYeah\\none company may handle the lot from\\nthat's it, yeah, yeah\\nThere's a lot of money to be made in that if you want little bits of, put things here and there that you can different  \\nmm  yeah I \\neven if he puts the cable in, did replace put the cable in then? No we subcontract it\\nOh yeah\\nwe've got two subcontractors that we get in touch with, they just do it and then bill owes and then we uplift it\\nYeah  but effectively the customers are only dealing with plastic of\\nMm\\nYeah for their own in installation like\\nYeah that's right yeah \\nYeah \\nprobably as we don't add any real value when we did little jobs like the cabling you know \\nYeah \\nthey come to us and all we've done is uplifting and gone bloody subcontracting\\nYeah\\nwhereas other bigger sites we do all the planning and everything you know\\nMm\\nso we actually add some value to it\\nWell we do that, we do that, we, we know \\nYeah \\nexactly what we've got, erm\\nYeah\\nhow many clients we've got, you know for updating, what the capacities are and plus er we don't know erm what sort of cable we've got in so they might have only a ten P a cable when they already have nine pairs in use\\nYeah\\nand they want two extra extensions you see in a certain area, we obviously don't know that\\nMm\\nonly the contractors do and even they only know when they go on site so, but we, we sort of say you do this, you do that and then we contract to who can do it, there's some of them by er\\nusually\\nmm \\nI think for er even for upgrades we er the contracts do it sometimes which to me's wrong cos they aren't engineers\\nMm \\nBut what er  what  what needles me a bit, but you can't blame them cos I, if I was er  a small communications firm I'd do the same myself, but, you see we won't sell now small systems through a sell\\nwe do it through a dealership, like if you want a Cortin if you want a Sierra you've got to go to Cowlers or something you can't go to Ford\\nMm\\nfor it, they won't sell it ya, it's the same as us, we won't sell direct\\nMm\\nso these businesses they buy from you know  erm communications company, a local company or Nottingham Telephones or something like that\\nMm\\nand, erm  what they tend to do once it's gone in they'll say if there's anything you need, if you get any problems on the system or there's anything you want he says get in touch with us, he says and if necessary we'll get in touch with \\nand we'll sort it out ourselves and what they do, if a customer says oh there's a phone that's broke, or it's not working or something like that, they'll say oh okay we'll get in touch with the maintenance for you, you see, cos he's making nowt out of it, if you say we dropped the phone and broke it, well we'll send a and then they send an engin one of their blokes out with a replacement phone and charge him for a new one, once they say wants some re-programming doing, oh yeah were sending an engineer round and they get, the dealer then gets the money for it so all we get is the flack end of it  you know so we, a service contract it's priced because, low because you know you're gonna make a bit on moves and changes\\nMm\\nand that sort of thing, you know re-programming and upgrade, but we don't get that now because the er, the dealers are filtering all that sort of work off\\nMm \\nwhich it can't be right cos, I suppose in a way it's none of our business but it is I mean if it  gets to it, it puts our company in financial difficulties it means it's jobs on the line int it that sort of thing\\nMm\\nthat's why we've got to start cutting back  there's no money for wage rises and that sort of thing so \\nwhat they are doing  you see, an authorized dealer, well even a non-authorized dealer get hold of a piece of kit and then somebody say want this system, right okay, and they just have a big load of forms for maintenance agreements and all they do the dealer'll go along and put this kit in, B T'll come along and say yeah that conforms to regulations, sign here, the customer er sign here, the dealer send the maintenance agreement to us, we signed it, send it back, we've never even seen it, then we turn up and find that the main control unit's high up in the attic or in a damp cellar, in a cupboard where you can't see it, there's no light and stuff like that and we're taking jobs on like that and it you know, it's just impossible to work on them\\nMm\\nyou see, but B T are not interested in that, all they're interested in is that the wiring's, you know that the boards are\\nMm\\nthe series that they should be, but we do pre-maintenance inspections now\\nMm \\nand, cos I said to the dealers for a long time you know don't put them under stairs, don't put them in store rooms, they get locked, locked up with vacuum cleaners and you can't get to the gear when you go to them, don't put them high up on the wall we can't reach them and they just laugh, but er, I think the last laugh's on us now cos er if I see one high up on the wall, I say well that, I say we're not accepting that, you have to move it\\nMm \\nwhat you doing you daft cat?\",\n",

Perhaps our Marg she's just that way\\noh it don't bloody matter to me \\nA apart from that \\nshe can stay away she can come, come round\\napart from that \\nshe can take her choice \\nthat would upset me mum and dad, I don't want, they're too old to be upset \\nWhat? you know\\nperhaps she's mellowed now, I mean the last time she went on with it, about it, was probably over a year ago, but she's still going on about it definitely a year ago not just \\nWhat to mum and dad or to you? er she's on, I think she said something earlier, well she told me she said something to mum and dad earlier on\\nBut she hadn't?

Well I do it probably was actually but it was the switch that had gone, maybe lightning had hopped across the switch, yeah, but erm, that's all it was it was the switch, but er, I mean the thing is it went wrong and they had to pay for it, okay it's only a tenner to have it done, but it, if a C D player, I mean if the carriage goes, you know, sixty, seventy quid, you know I'm buying these electrical things, it's, because it's a burg lock, I can buy them, get them a warranty with it an'all, then it's took the burden off them.

Change the C P U? Bloody hell, mm, well I'd escalate it because it's a known problem, they might come, turn back and say change the C P U. Well you know what you can do \\nThey're not they're not gonna do anything about it\\nThey're gonna ask if you've changed it\\nYeah they will yeah, well you can have a word with them first, you've got to have a word with them before you escalate any way\\nYeah\\nbut I, I think that's the erm \\nbut I mean \\nthat's the answer \\nI, shouldn't I, that decoder's got to  er \\nIt's got to be told something before it does it yeah \\nYeah , you'll, you'll hear that actually come in, if you disconnect one of those legs, if you disconnect that blue wire  on there and then cease the intercom and put it back down again you know the relay clicking  you'll hear it come in and go back out again, there you go \\nSo the twenty four volts is here permanent\\nOh yeah  yeah  yeah  I say reset the system, do a system reset and then see how it goes, it's all, it, it er it's the main problem them, and there's no cure for it. We've spent months of shelving and then in the end he just says oh sod it, just took it out for an eight one six then. There is one other cure \\nWhat's that take the bell off? What can you, I don't know if you ever, ever came across any of these er the mark two that want an extension and I think it would project a\\nproducing stuff\\nMm\\nand it was er\\nOh acoustics\\nYeah, that would cure the bastard, cos it would only ring when this rang\\nIt would also ring if you pull a page out. What was it an amplifier with a speak on it? It's a little acoustic er coupler type\\nWhat does it do sense a sound and then ring \\nYeah \\nring a bell or does it actually pour out of a speaker what comes out of a speaker? No it rings a bell\\nDoes it? Yeah\\nSo if I call a paging call out and a paging call comes out it's gonna ring the bloody bell\\nNot necessarily \\nI don't particularly want to get involved in anything like that\\nYeah\\nbut I tell you what you know the mark two, have you ever displayed a coder and it rings, rings the bell when the intercom rings, rings the bell if the trunk's designed to ring and all that, you know when you get the, you put a call on hold and it comes back and it goes brr, brr, brr, the bell starts going ding, ding, ding, a right noise and apparently that's standard in the system  I think that was a bit of an oversight to be honest with you \\nSo the, it's not worth changing the data and the\\nNot data to the\\nno I mean change the data\\nto the phone \\nNo I tell you it's wasting my time it's a known problem\\nSay is there something on the data\\nwell whenever I've had this \\nClear this rubbish up\\nWell you know the one at erm  the environmental\\nMm\\nthe erm  the displayed decoded it's actually mounted next to the kit and all we'll do is take twenty four volts out, volts out, they'll take the, take the data off the kit itself and then just bring twenty four volts out \\nYeah\\nyou know, maybe cos the signal's stronger now I don't know, but that's the way to do it there, well you've got to bring twenty four volts out anyway\\nOh yeah I'll get \\nyou can take it here or you can take it there, it's just that the, the displayed decoder is safer\\nMm, but what I can't weigh up is there's nothing wrong together in the first place\\nfound the twenty four volts\\nWhere is that? Across there through that gap \\nThe very, the very strays are where the wire goes, if you look at the drawing there a bit er, it actually comes in and out you know, one, one of them is actually the same, it actually just comes in and loops in and goes out again and you may \\nfind that you're actually on the same potential there, could be low potential and difference between the two  that's all you need\\nSomething there  there  there it's them two, it looks like it could be them, with them round together\\nYeah, that's right\\nSo weird\\nOh very weird, yeah, I \\npreferred I mean  there must be some more, how many more lines are there, look, hang on then\\nWell\\nthere you are\\nend of the bloody wires are causing that then is there? Why? They say \\nSay, say that is the bell\\nYeah  mm \\nand they're your data\\nmm\\nthey're not paralleled off\\nOh\\nthey're not paralleled off\\nIt's a weird way of doing things, it's extremely, it's, it's weird, if you look at the drawing\\nI don't even need to look at the drawing for this\\nit's only six\\nwell to have to see take the bloody thing off\\nOh shut up moaning we've got, aha I'm going down to er Wellingborough in the next\\nWellingborough? Why what you gonna say? Your going to Wellingborough that's a bloody turn up for the books isn't it? I upset George the other day\\nWhy? He says well I, we were on about sort of and he says bring it up at the next meeting, I says\\nI says what meeting's that? He says, the next regional meeting it's being held in Neesden he says you can go to that one can't ya? I says no I can't, he says it's not very far, I said it's not the distance that bothers me it's the fact that you want us to sit there till eleven o'clock at night and not get paid for it, he says yeah but if you want to say something, I says I'd say something if I thought we'd be backed on it, but we're not, oh I'm not going anywhere to be if I'm not being paid\\nI'm not getting involved \\nI didn't know Dick  was er  Bob, moving, er Dick  's\\nis it? Yeah, cos he covers Derby, he lives in Calverton, he comes through Nottingham to get to Derby, I live in Nottingham and I just do Nottingham, I'm nearer to Derby than what he is, near as door bell, I think it's the way they've laid it out though\\nWell they're trying to send \\nit is \\nthey're trying to send me on\\non that what? well why don't you go? That's not on my patch like\\nIt's my patch, suit me here\\nWell I did make\\ndo what\\ncompany here\\nnever heard of it\\nyeah well it did didn't it when the weather's like that \\nThere we are\\nif you're gonna do that, I'll tell ya if you switch it off and switch it back on again if, if it's the problem I think it is it'll cure it, if it's  which I don't think it is, it's the other one that's incurable\\nIncurable\\nIt's incurable  the reason I say it's incurable the system's too \\nEh? The reason I say it's, it's, the system's too old to go back to the Japs and say get this sorted out, rewrite the software because they're just gonna say not likely we haven't made it for ten years, or whatever  seven or eight years or whatever it is, it's out of date, they're not gonna start working on the system that's that old  all they'll want to do is to sell you a new one\\nYeah\\nthat's what we'll do\\nare they overhead them cables? They're not are the oh they are, the end there\\nbloody hell \\nno I don't think it's in there, it's just description stuff, sizes and what have you  maybe on the right section there, it's the one where you might wire the L J Us up as well, that's\\nsection, ah I think it is, that's it the one with the M B F to\\nwhat's that? Station socket\\nRight\\nbox \\nextension belt  there it is next page  there you go  hear that mate, it just goes in there look, and that, oh hang on a minute no it don't that goes to the bell, through the bell, back out again  and then  er\\nCome out through the bell, back through the bell on to there and back to there\\nThat's right through this big\\nthat's right, so you'll probably only just seeing\\nYeah\\ncircuitry there and then there's your, your data\\nwhich you, you do parallel off\\nYeah\\nlike a yellow and that just says ring, ring, ring that brings the lane and it just does that, that's that belt, all it's doing is taking it through them relay contacts\\nYeah  mm I see\\nwhich is why you don't see a voltage at the same leg really\\nYeah  fucking weird though innit why it should suddenly start pulling like that\\nThat's the way they are, have, have you any extension, extensions put in? Tell you what it could be, ah hang on a minute, I ordered an extension for a bloody for a phone for that office, it could be the phone that's doing it in that office there  I know, I know  it could be corrupting, you know on the mark one the big one, the old generation mark one\\nIt's been going on for months\\nHas it? Two or three months\\nOh two or three months\\nYeah, but it's got worse and worse\\nOh right, yeah\\nand he said it's got worse since he got the new switchboard operator, which makes you think\\nShe's probably putting calls, she ain't cos we've tried it over there, you pressed intercom, put it down, it, it does that\\nShouldn't do that should it? No, I tell ya, there's about four in the company started doing it altogether, oh this is about the fourth one I think  why that's what third\\ntold me I was talking to Brian  day before yesterday, second line, he says there's loads of them doing it and it can't be cured \\nWell all we can do then is reset innit? Yeah, let's do a system reset and\\nyou sure you put everything back together that end first\\nVery careful, we'll do that when we get over there, ha \\nLet me get me glasses\\nit looks more like the Selby's one than the erm, than the environmental\\nOh, I mean\\ncos the main environmental was er, it did it on its own, with a completely empty switchboard, no calls on five o'clock at night, everybody had gone home and the bloody thing would just sit ringing, ringing, ringing, ringing and erm \\nI know this is only when the switchboard's busy\\nYeah, well you know this, this Selby's one that was the same, when the switchboard was busy it would er, if you, if you sees line three and played it down, well if anybody sees line three and played it down it used to do that or if you sees the intercom that did it, says it's more like the Selby's one than the new one \\nWell I \\nand that was incurable\\nwell that was only there\\nIf you see line three on \\nYou got the key? You've got it\\nI ain't got the key  I ain't got the key you had it\\nYou put it in your pocket\\nI didn't  you've got it\\nRight then, what you got there for? better tell them first\\nYou tell them  can we just switch the phones off for a couple of minutes, no, no calls on are they? Cheers, okay Dave  give it a good thirty second\\nbet you've got a screwdriver over there ain't ya? Got to put this one back together while we're waiting \\nOh\\nWhat you got after this then, d'ya know? Dunno\\nmm\\nThat one of Selby's you know it was fine until they put an extension in just er a key station as soon as they did that this one started acting up, so he said it's only since we did that, he said it happened the day after we put that in, I said okay, disconnected it, still did it, disconnected it at the, end here, still did it, erased it from the program so it didn't even know it existed, still did it\\nyeah, I, er\\nwait for the light to come back up \\nhave you connected it? Yeah, even connected it on the end here, the, the station and set this display decoder up and it even did it there so it was nothing to do with the live lamp wire, the way they routed it we thought that perhaps rerouted it to the cable or something like that\\nYeah\\nnothing  went round and unplugged every phone out, wedged every one out cos we thought it might of been a station that's going down, cos er I'm saying about the mark one, the old\\ntwo sixty, if you've got a bad phone it used to drag the paging down for all others, where if you've got paint in the socket\\nYeah\\nor a bit of mould in one of the sockets it used to click all the phones when anybody made a call and er, all, all sorts of things that, I would of thought ah there's a faulty phone somewhere and it's degenerating and er we went round and waste every single one out, every single one, went to this extension pressed line three, play it down and the phone rang, I thought right it's not a phone, I changed the cabinet, I changed all the cards and the cards in one big one, I had one three\\nso it weren't interacting between the two, everything had changed and it still did it, were a new kit, got a cabinet of setting line, changed it and it still did it. Well it st I mean it's something stupid innit? Because the simple reason\\nI even went in at seven in the morning when they've got no compressors going in case it was the compressors dragging the whatsit down\\nbecause to me it's, it's something like that  everything, it's gotta be the C P U innit? It's gotta be something telling that bell to ring\\nThat's right \\nand you would think if you change every bloody thing out\\nThat's right \\nwhenever it was telling it to ring \\nThat's right \\nto stop\\nYeah, well I got a kit there and I wir I wired, just put it on the floor and it\\nlight on the wall, had it all connected bang, bang, pull them erm, er wired them all up and still did it, that mine? Or yours? Yours\\nIs it? Yours \\nYours \\nCall one please ring Brian  before ten thirty, it's ten twenty nine now so, oh bloody car phone \\nIt's like Selby must be decoder number right round here\\nNo find it next to the unit, next to the\\nThat's what I like you co , you depend on someone helping me out and\\nDon't\\nout on you\\nWell I, I wonder  if it does occur again, happen again\\nYeah\\ndo decode it  it's hell of a run you know innit? I did that at Selby's, I had the decoder, the new cabinet, everything, I had the decoder there hanging on the floor like that, I wired it up and I pressed extension sixteen and away it went, it said four there and the display decoder was there about ten extensions \\nAnd it was about ten, sixteen that was doing it\\nI think it was sixteen yeah, fifteen or sixteen, I'm sure it was sixteen\\nAye you said, like you say it could be se \\nbut third lines\\nthat is something that'd happened all of a sudden, of about four throughout the cou , well three at the time throughout the country have suddenly gone like it within about a month or so of each other , and they've never had any trouble before, but I was talking to Brian  and he said that's a load of cobblers, he says it's been doing it for a long time and there's loads of them doing it. Unless we\\nand see what's been used\\nYeah  well if, if I get called backed to\\nit, or I'll change that display decoder first, I mean that's been reset now, forget that, er\\nAye\\nyeah, well if you can get out o, f of that though\\nYou can\\nCan you, what on eight three one? Oh dear \\nI mean  I figured it's gotta be something date, dated I feel\\nOh aye, yes\\ncause it to do it\\nWell I thought that, but er\\nyou know, that was my\\nto do it, but then again that was in it all the time, you know, it just don't make sense\\nfunny how they're both garages weren't it? Mm  in fact, eh I tell you what\\nOver head\\nall, yeah they're not, round the corner, all three garages is this is Selby's and there's erm, Selby's is Volkswagen repairer and er, oh no, yeah Lee invite\\nit was in their garage where the lorry was. Of all the systems we've got three garages it's happened to, radio station\\nI think that wants putting back together there\\nEh? If you want to ring Brian \\nCancel that will clear it up\\nPut this one back together\\nI thought you'd on we'll do a reset and see how it goes, and just leave it if it, if it clears it erm that's fine \\nAnd if not I think the next thing actually is to move the decoder  or change the decoder\\nChange it, wow, bloody step\\nThat's three times you try to fall that, if you have an industrial injury\\nThree steps to heaven that's what it is, kill myself next time\\nSomebody said did you see the accident, no \\nI ask did I have my eyes shut when I kicked him, er\\nFree line now\\nYeah I just clear it  er I don't like the idea of doing that actually\\nWhy?

I can't remember now, I know I've had a go to have a look at them to see how, to see exactly how, cos what I thought, what I thought I was gonna do was, I didn't like the furniture of the, of the speakers and when I was keeping that system I was gonna remount the speakers in the box a bit more you know decorative\\nbut erm, you know, I remember as coming across one or two obstacles and I couldn't get in to it  I thought if I'd tried a bit harder, I didn't want to start you know  so\\nI've been thinking about convert these speakers this time\\nMm\\nbecause you only sort of need to buy one set of speakers\\nMm\\nmove the cabinets and if they're no good just cut them up and throw them away\\nYeah\\nyou know, but, one of them it shows you inside the side view of the cabinet\\nYeah\\nright, and you've got your speaker there, and you've got your\\ncoming down like that, but in the corner you've got a piece of concrete\\nConcrete? and ceramic tiles set on it\\nYou're joking\\nEh?

Yeah\\nreally\\nbut it's the right size\\nThis is it you see, I mean a, a company like  or  have gone to a lot of trouble to get that length right, er and to tune the box and all this that and the other and get the right, I don't know maybe  er just think oh you know you just build this, put this massive speaker in and call it a sub based woofer\\nMm\\nyou know, you don't know what the qualities gonna be like, it's alright getting one for fifty quid\\nYeah\\nif it's decent, but if you've got a decent system and you've got a crap\\nyou're really wasting your time having one\\nYeah I know\\nYeah cos I've seen a sub based\\nthey're over three hundred pounds and there must be a difference\\nis it?

It gives you the fastest route\\nShortest by road \\nShortest route \\nYeah\\nand an intermediate route\\nYeah\\nor in some cases you get two intermediate routes\\nMm\\nand it tells you how far away it is, how long it should take you to get there \\nto get there, yeah, you can put the time of day in as well can't ya? You can tell it what time you wanna set out\\nYeah\\nyou can also tell it what you \\nI think it also works out the, the traffic load\\nYeah\\nyou can also, you can also \\nAmazing \\nwork out if you want to avoid a place, you can put, say, say you're going from\\nMm or you can go by \\nsay from here here to Corby or something like that\\nMm\\nwhere you go, you go through Leicester more or less wouldn't you? Yeah\\nAnd you can just put down Nottingham to Corby avoiding Leicester\\nYeah\\nand it says break and you can put out all your stops going in\\nMm\\nyou know you stop for twenty minutes, put twenty minutes, and you, you just press return and it throws a map up, a map of part of England\\nMm\\nwhere you are\\nThat's it\\ngoes\\nlike that and puts all the numbers in\\nMm\\nand then you can zoom in on it closer\\nYeah that's it you can move the arrow around can't ya, the arrow moves\\nYes\\nand you can move the arrow and the cursor, that's it an arrow and a mouse you just hit it and it expands that bit\\nYeah you can zoom into it, you can zoom out from it, then you can put more detail in it, put more little places in around it and you can \\nThat's it, yeah \\nwhere, where you are and that\\nI think Gordon's got one, we use one at work though, yeah it's, yeah yes it's very good \\nand then you just print it out and what you do \\ninstead of, instead of in the map with a, with a drawing like that\\nMm\\nyou, you get to the text one as well? Yeah\\nWhere it tells you you're at \\nYeah that's it\\nNottingham and\\nThat's it\\nyou have to walk so and so for three miles\\nYeah that's it\\nYeah\\nOften my\\nthat's it, yeah, yeah, you can give it to the driver then can't you? Yeah\\nMm\\nI was just wondering how on earth your supposed to get to the M one heading towards er Bramford I mean\\nno Cockbrave, everywhere you go from here is towards Cockbrave\\nIs it? Yeah \\nI like, I like that, I like the idea of it telling you how far it is\\nYeah\\nLovely\\nYeah\\nyou know it's\\nif you put twenty minute break in then does it tell you which is the best cafe to stop at and how much egg and chips cost you? and what you can do is if you've got a\\nyeah\\nyou can go and say er Nottingham, Grantham, Grantham to Lincoln, Lincoln to Newark and it'll tell you the, the route between each town\\nYeah\\nlike that you see, if you get to Lincoln you've done that one\\nYeah\\ngo down here, down here, down here\\nyou see it\\nMm, very good, yeah, I was spellbound when I first saw that, saw that about, I think the first time about three years ago\\nhow, how long did it take Mick to sort it out? Sorry? How long did it take Mick to sort a route out? Erm, it all depends, it looks erm\\nOn that one it sort of leaves a disk, it's got like a bar underneath\\nMm\\nand as it's checking the list for the roads in the town \\nThat is I think that is\\nit, it cuts down like that, then it goes off then it starts again, then it goes off and then goes\\nthat's it yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm vaguely recalling it now because it was six months ago since I saw Mick's but er, yeah that sounds about right\\nMm\\nI can remember something about that\\neight hundred and forty eight miles\\nReally? fourteen hours and something\\nGood lord\\nthat's without a break\\nYeah, well he's, when he first says to me he says right he says er, this was when I first got an inkling that he was gonna check the mileage you know like for the future, and it says erm, where do you wanna go to? I says er  when was it, he says where do you wanna go from? I says Scotland, he says where? To Nottingham, where do you wanna go by? I says Dublin  he says I can't it's gotta be in Geordie then he says erm he says well where do you wanna go through? I says well Blackpool then, did all the routes you know, tell you all the routes that you can take for you know, and that took what fifteen seconds, twenty seconds or something to work that out, maybe there's not a lot to er alternatives\\nUsually has a C C\\nthat's it er yeah but the thing is learners can't use motorways, er they want something to, wish to avoid motorways\\nI think there might be yeah \\nYeah \\nI ain't had a proper look I just put it on and said, work a few routes out you know where it\\nYeah\\nwhere you're going, I mean I did Nottingham to Peterborough, how long did it take Nottingham to Peterborough? Hour fifteen under\\nAn hour and eleven\\nYeah\\none hour and eleven minutes it said on there\\nthat's from door to door\\nYeah will do, yeah\\nIt'll take me fifty minutes\\nDid it? Yeah, but I mean I think this is sticking to us\\nI tell you another option, tell you another option you've got in it, you can put down your G T I as well you can go in a G T I\\nWhat's that? I don't know the difference that makes but it's got an option, something like erm\\nWell it's for time int it, obviously \\nnormal normal car\\nYeah\\nyou know van, lorries and stuff like that \\nbut, but the thing is if, if the traffic's gonna be heavy, if it thinks we're gonna get stuck in traffic, if you've got a G T I you're that type of driver you've got that type of power, you can sort of pass and save a bit of time\\nYeah\\nso maybe it's, yeah, it's a good idea though  yeah \\nYeah have you seen those things like, like these\\nit's like an L C D screen between\\nthe one with the, with the, with the map spins on the side of the road? The one\\nIt's a screen about this big right and you put it on your dashboard and plug it in to your cigarette lighter and er it's like a control centre and if there's been a crash\\nMm\\non the roads and if there's road works or summat, the section on, it's got all the major roads\\nMm\\nand this section on your L C D flashes and you can like and you can zoom in and it'll say blah, blah, blah, road works at such and such avoid, or something like that\\nMm\\nI know they did\\nyou had it, you had it on your dashboard like that, you know like a map\\nYeah\\nand what happen was you had like a, a receiver in your car and all the information was transmitted from, transmitted from like on lamp post\\nYeah\\nand if you was, it says like he, you\\ngoing to Oxford, if you went to Oxford and you come to such and such a way and you're going out towards Ipswich and the big roundabout there was\\nMm\\nyou know solid or there's been an accident it tells you there's an accident at, at this point\\nMm\\nand this is your alternative route and gives you an alternative way to go round to get passed it\\nYeah\\nI'd seen an accident the other day in town I'd seen two and did you notice\\nthey knocked the bridge down\\nWhat bridge?\",\n",

Mm\\nAnd there was a single decker bus then, right, stopped in the middle of the road and there was an Escort and he'd gone under the back right up to his windscreen like that the back \\nReally? the back of the bus was right at his windscreen like that \\nAye, cos they're quite high aren't they at the back, them Fords ain't they? Yeah, and it was right up to his windscreen\\nGood god\\njust look, the windscreen weren't broke\\nYeah\\nbut the back of the bus was level with it like that\\nYeah, you know these short dump trucks, the little stubby things, I saw one of them once erm, at the junction of Avenue Street and erm, well outside Lynn's there\\nMm\\nand there was this dump truck sort of about two foot out, he'd obviously changed his mind and sort of had er stopped, had a Reliant Regal, you know a Reliant Regal it was right up to the windscreen and there was a pile of glass in, you know everywhere it was\\nTell you what \\nand that was that was done right underneath this lorry\\non the, on the way to work one morning when I was, I was at\\nI went, I used to go into town, past that grey garden  up, up Forest Road\\nYeah\\nand then turn left and you're down towards Icing Green, do you know where I mean?

Eh yeah Rick's er, Rick's car broke down you know and, and van broke down and somebody he, he, he lived in Clifton and worked at Radcliff on Trend and somebody says to him oh you can borrow our car it was a Reliant Regal, eh he said oh god, you know, I'll have to park it round the corner, and he got out, didn't go into work, you know go to work every day where erm\\nyeah, no problem, and he says when you're driving along he says people flashing me, he says you see a head a pair of headlights flashing you think, it's not, it's another Reliant Regal some other bloke with a cap on you know\\nyou know, one enthusiast club\\nWe had a bit of fun er not last Saturday the Saturday before didn't we? We went bowling, he, come across he says\\nOh I, yeah, yeah haven't a car\\nhe says oh can we go in your car tonight he says mine's er, the alternator's gone\\nYeah\\nand you have to push it to start it like, I says yes alright then, I knew the timing was out on mine so I thought I'd do that this afternoon\\nMm\\nbefore we go, so I'm out there just set the timing\\nthen all of a sudden it went, but you know like\\nkids give it a shove, pushed it on the street\\nso turned it round and come back, this bloke pulls up in this er  well three, three litre\\nsuper job was it? Yeah\\nYeah\\nJ reg weren't it, jumped out, wanna push? Yeah alright then, got down about ten yards it started again\\nYeah\\ngot it home and what it is, is the timing on the car probably cos it's so old\\nYeah\\nis a lot further up er what it says in the book, no way near them\\nYeah you can't set it by the book\\nso I just, you know\\nTill it sounded right\\nMm that's it\\nThat's it, I do till it peaks without pinking\\nYeah\\nthat's it, it's done\\nYeah\\nso it er, it were running alright then, and er I took it for a spin I went round the block, up Robin Hood Way \\nWhich one's that? Yeah, yeah\\nYeah, up to Wickes\\nMm, mm\\nstraight up the erm by the custom bridge, right up to the next island round there, round the island and back down again\\nyeah\\nYeah\\nI give it some you know \\nYeah \\nback over the flyover, back down here, comes up stop, turns it straight back on again\\noh no\\nYeah\\nthought right, spanner  took it out the starter motor\\nWhat's that? Well it wasn't it was the solenoid\\nYeah, is it for a gauge? A ring\\nIs the solenoid on the starter? Yeah, yeah, what it, what it was on them ones\\nwhen you turn your key it suddenly clicks and it clicks the thingy forward\\nYeah\\nand then when it does that when the solenoid comes back\\nMm\\nit comes back through the starter motor and so I thought oh right strip it all down see what's up, see if it's bent inside\\nYeah\\nstrips it all down, gets the book out, do this, no, that don't work, put the book away\\nAha \\nripped it to pieces \\nYeah just use your commonsense\\ntook it all to pieces, cleaned it up all inside it's great, I thought right I'll take it outside and I'll try it now\\nMm\\njust outside\\nheld your foot on it so it didn't fly all over the place, yeah\\nyeah\\nwhere's all this gone\\nYeah\\nI thought I'll get one  down the scrap yard\\nWell the\\nyeah so you can get the solenoid off\\nEh? don't you? No, the one, the one I worked on it was inter \\nyou had to get a, take, replace the lot\\nThe cella solenoid on the top like that\\nYeah\\nand all, all it's got is now\\nKeith? No ta\\nyeah\\nthis\\nDon't put it on the floor\\nthis solenoid is under\\nIt look like ribbon and there's more to come\\nYeah\\nWhat do you mean I made it like a brick? A bit slow on that one weren't ya? there's this solenoid on the top\\nYeah\\nand it's got like a, a metal thing that comes from it and it's on a pivot\\nMm\\nlike, so you've got a solenoid that holding the top on the pivot and the bit at the bottom just like a\\nlike that\\nYeah like selector like a J selector? Yeah\\nYeah\\nand when it clicks back it just goes like that, it pushes and pulls\\nYeah\\nand all you do is you take that pin out and pull it out \\nOh, eh\\noh, eh, does it? yeah go on\\nSo I went round the scrap yard\\nto er, what's it called? yeah\\nKen's\\nAh\\nNo, not\\nanyway went in, have you got one? Well there's one there, there's one there and there's one round the back, so I looked in that one\\nit's a different engine\\nYeah\\ncos in, when you\\nand it shows you the, the engine\\nI went round the back and they'd got\\nyours a two litre? I thought it was a sixteen hundred, yeah\\nyeah\\nlooked in it they're the same, I thought\\ntried to pull it out, it won't come out, there's a bracket on it, on the back\\nWas it? Yeah, and it was getting a bit dark and I couldn't see\\nOh\\nand I couldn't see underneath like er\\nis it done? I said no not yet, he says we're going in a minute, quarter to\\ndip stick\\nYeah\\npulled it out the way, fiddle me car\\nyeah\\nand then I go some, put it in\\nIt's alright\\ncleaned it all first\\nYeah my nephew's selling an X R Two you know, grant it in the paper's three thousand\\nwhatever it is, deflate, and er  guy come round, no problems, no problems with it, well I mean the head gasket's gone and there's a hole near the wing and bald tyre on it but mechanically it's, this guy comes round to look at it, I mean he's been driving it from Plymouth, he's in the navy, up and down here, bloke comes round, yeah no problem, come on round mate, come and have a look at it, look round it, says yeah I like this can I just take it for a drive? Yeah, goes click, click, click, the starter motor, wouldn't believe it would ya? Eh? Would of finished up\\nand now the van's got the red light heat coming on, on the battery, took it into the garage and checked it, it's charging the battery alright, its alternator's okay, but we don't know what it is  but when you turn it on, when you turn the key on in the morning\\nYeah\\nyou know where the indicator's on it's a dead flash int it? Yeah\\nIt sounds like that, but in the dashboard\\non the back of the er alternator\\nIs it? Yeah\\nYour instrument voltage regulator\\nThat's what I think it is\\nYeah\\nit's not cutting out for the for the thingy \\nThat's right is your\\nno\\nOh\\nWhat, what else is happening, you know you know your brake warning lights? Yeah\\nWhen your brakes are going\\nYeah\\nerm that then don't come on either, but when it clicks like that they flash together and they both light up, and then when you start it up they go up and then they come back on again\\nYou got an\\nproblem? I don't think so  he, he says it's charging alright so\\nsounds like you've got a\\nto me\\nThis is it, if it's a\\nyeah\\nIf the, if the battery was, like if you want it\\nthe battery, when you turn it on that\\nthat's true, yeah\\nYeah, so you can leave it and\\nbut this, this er starter motor is the one I bought from the\\nis better than the one that's in it\\nYeah\\nit's got four good\\ninstead of two\\nHas it? Yeah\\nyeah, well is it? you've got more chance of it firing\\nYeah, cos if one set go you still got\\nright  I went to G T Cars\\nYeah, will they do it? to ask about the\\nyeah\\nTo buy one\\nI bet they'll sell you one wouldn't they? Yeah they would, yeah\\nDid they? Yeah and\\nstarter motor before\\nYeah\\nI says er how much are they? how much? Well I'd say to price it, I know they're not quite so expensive on carpet but I'd say  I'd say about seventeen pounds, but I bet it was about twenty seven or thirty one\\nIt was about fifty seven\\nYou're joking, just for a solenoid? I said alright, how much is it for the starter motor with the solenoid built onto it like? Oh probably about sixty two\\nEighty quid\\nYeah, that's it\\nTwenty quid for a starting motor\\nYeah\\nI'll have one of them\\nwell he says we've had so many of them\\nI thought I'm not surprised\\nI've got er, I've got a database\\nYeah\\non a database because it'll soon be\\nwhat I've done is I've put like erm  the year, the year and the make of the month, right\\nthe month anyway, so I've put something like one, ten, eighty seven  right as the month and after that I've put down what magazine it is\\nYeah\\nevery\\nyeah\\nand then I've put project what it's called and then I've put what kind of project it is what type \\nOh right \\nand then I've put like audio\\nYeah\\nand photographic\\nYeah\\nso that in the end when I sell it again I can put the type in alphabetical ascending order\\nMm\\nso it'll be like erm amplifier, bass amplifier\\nYeah\\nyou know\\nOh yeah\\nthings like that\\nYeah\\nIt, it's all that and then you can just look through the amplifier\\nand it takes about eighty records at a time because it's using forty five letters with the\\nright\\ncos some of them are dead wrong\\nYeah\\nerm so many for the dates and for so many for the\\nand so on like that and er, I thought okay\\nI don't like the bow on it \\nload it, sort it out and print it, right? Mm\\nIt starts off happily printing away, gets to page full\\nYeah\\nstarts to wind fan fold paper and wind it and wind it and wind it\\nBet they're all printed\\nit's coming right through\\nI thought what the bloody hell's all this\\nYeah\\nswitched it off, fanned it all back, right and I thought start again, I must be doing something wrong, so I\\nthe switches in the back\\nYeah\\nso er  I thought I'd try it on one piece  one piece of paper\\nYeah\\none with perforation on\\nYeah\\ntry it on that, put the paper in\\ndid pass the paper and er the paper light comes on\\nRight, yeah, and he's carried on printing while the\\npaper like\\nReally? Yeah, gets\\npage, winds that piece of paper out, withdraw the package like that\\nYeah\\nand then it winds another piece of paper in and starts printing again\\nyeah, aha\\nYou're supposed to be using that, so it's printing the sheet and throwing it out and\\nprinting on that one and then throwing that out and making another one\\nYeah\\nthat's why the, that's why they're running backwards and then forwards again\\nMm\\nto make sure it ain't falling in, you know\\nWhat printer is it? Epsom\\nThey're good\\nvery good, yeah, I say you could borrow my printer again, but that's, that packed up you know\\nDid it? that printer of mine, yeah about\\nabout, no, no it's only about a fortnight ago, I was on site doing a job and I come out and  as far as you know what you call courtesy dial in a card, so that you don't cut anybody off, you can dial it and everybody says oh what's going off, you know, you can courtesy dial it, when we've finished it shuts that channel down\\nMm\\nyeah\\noh can't get it, and that's what we do and it comes up three channels you can use and somebody else cleared out two channels are used and if them channel\\neverybody on that call, instead of sixteen channels on a card and there's five people using it, it comes up five channels in use and blocks out number eleven so that nobody else can use it\\nAh right\\nyou see? as they as they share the line it switches them off\\nBlocks them off as well yeah, and it comes up one channel in use  when they cleared out card down, it clears the card so you can take it out  I don't, they come down three channels in use, two channels in use, one channel in use.\",\n",

       " \"Mm. And we're going to hear this . Yes just start any time  \\nWill I will I just go ahead and Aye. And is my voice is that will that be \\nAha. Yeah that's I'll just have a look on that  check the label. that's fine. Looking back to nineteen thirty five brings back memories to us older generation of the splendid summers when the herring fishing was booming in Stronsay. No lovelier sight was ever seen than the herring drifters coming in with their catch of herring on a calm sea in the mornings. The the horse-drawn lorries going to the different curing stations where the gutter girls stood at the far end dressed in their oilskin aprons ready to start the day's work. No grumblers there believe me and to walk past them would be to hear them singing while you work. Their gutting knives flashing in time to the music. When I was about ten years old, a trip to the village from the South end was a bigger thrill than a trip to a big city would be to a present day child, later working in the village as a teenager, the dances every Saturday and Monday night was enjoyment never to be forgot. Two of the Fiddler family from Rose cottage provided music with piano and violin. No amplifiers in those days, but the old cinema rang from end to end with everyone in festive mood. There were three ice cream shops and a chip shop doing brisk trade all the time. Most of us oldies remember Mr , going his rounds with his ice cream barrel, proclaiming his wares to be the best in the world and no Summer was complete without him. On Sunday night, a visit to Sister  's rest hut to join in the hymn singing was the highlight of the week. With a small harmonium providing the lead it really was magnificent harmony. Sister  will always be remembered for her words, You must be cruel to be kind. This was when she had held a poisoned finger in a bowl of very hot water but she always got good results. At the close of the fishing season, the fishing folks always sang as the boat left the Stronsay pier and to hear the song, We're no away to bide a while, always brings back memories. Stronsay fish mart in the fishing time was really a busy place with the salesmen busy selling the herring to the curing stations. This is only looking back close on fifty years. To look to look back further to the sailing boats, no doubt would be to recall an even busier village. Mhm. It would have been,\\nYes. The cinema was at the back of the present hotel. it was built first to show pictures, then turned into a dance hall. Musicians in nineteen thirty five was Mrs , North Cliff, the piano, and her brother Karl  on violin. M C was late Danny ,. The small water boats ran between Papay and Stronsay ferrying people across. I have seen them leaving Stronsay after a dance and you would still have heard them singing when they reached Papay. Duneva was a Church of Scotland rest hut and there was a English church beside Glenfield. That church blew down in the nineteen thirty two hurricane.\",\n",
       " 'That right?',\n",
       " \"Mhm. That's right. There was also a gut factory where the herring guts was made into fish meal. That was in the field as you turn at the Ayre of the Myres. The cement founds are still in Hunton Field. usually through the Summer, we got a visit from the Kirkwall City Pipe Band and they marched up and down the village playing, usually followed by a crowd of Bairns. Twice I can remember the Kirkwall Brass Brand pray playing in the cinema and twice I remember a circus visiting. But that was further back in nineteen twenty seven and twenty eight.\",\n",
       " \"I did. Mhm. No wild animals, just ponies, monkeys and dogs, but it was great thrill seeing a girl in green tights and a frilly skirt, standing on a pony's back while it galloped round the ring. I tried that later myself but fell off. Yeah  green tights. That was something that stuck in my mind mm . That stuck in your mind  \\nI can remember at least six of the Stronsay women gutting the herring at that time and they stood on Moars beach. There were three in a crew, two to gut and one to pack the herring in the barrels. The drifters came in to both piers and on a Saturday night, the village was a busy place. The coal boats lay out where the old barge is now and the drifters went alongside them to get coal. The coal boats were manned by locals and the late J ,, used to work there every Summer. Needless to say there was plenty tricks played on each other and once when the summer was finished, Jimmy couldn't get his trunk to move. Some joker had it nailed to the floor. Usually Hunton and Whitehall supplied the four wheel lorries but lots of farmers from up the highlands supplied carts. Mhm. Big stock boats came from Russia and Germany for the salted Herring and it was a busy time when they were loading. It was dangerous on the roads for bairns as usually the horses with running with the carts. Stronsay hotel was a lovely house with nine bedrooms, a big public bar and a smaller lounge bar. There was a large hole hall at the back with a bar. All this was required on a Saturday night. I have seen the dyke before the village entirely filled up with men sitting there discussing the week's fishing. on a Saturdays afternoon, they all set out and walked up past Sandybank and along to the Mill Road and the back to the village along the sand. They were all dressed in Black knitted jerseys and dark trousers. Mhm. The jerseys were usually done in intricate patterns. The hotel was burnt to the ground in August nineteen thirty nine. And what the other bit of information you got  any odd snippets of information you've got written down there. When\\nMhm just just \\nWhen you were speaking of the the hulks Nana, there were five hulks there. Mhm. There was David , erm  from Stramness, Jimmy  from Stramness, Duncan , a cement barge and there a fifth one but I'm not right sure of that. For me my husband John Miller, was on that hulk the whole time. And they had three cargoes of coal in the Summertime, every week. They had three cargoes of coal. Between two and three hundred tonnes every time. Mm. And they start on a Monday and they had it finished by Tuesday and then they start on Wednesday and Thursday and and then they went on Friday and Saturday. And that was the finish. It was most of them was local men but a lot of the Westray men and  used to come too and help out. And the Stramness men on  's boat. Was there a lot of people who came to  to work here in the fishing town. Yes they came for the other islands. the West coast and that but there were folk  \\nOh yes they came from Holm and the Kirkwall and\\nAnd then the came from Westray \\nAnd they came from Westray and Sanday and Edie and all that places to help out. work on the coal boats and just different things like that. They were on  on the boats too. And there's the the the last cooper cooper  see they'd got  coopers. There were six there was eighteen crews on Moars with three in each crew. And the the last copper died two weeks ago. Eric . And he was the last cooper. That Stronsay that was left on that worked on Moars. Eric . And he gave me that information that there were eighteen crews. Just in the one curing station? On that this curing station here . Mhm. So that gives you an idea there was seventeen stations in Stronsay  five in Papay. well you see \\nand that was . And then there was all the coopers. How many is that. curing stations. is that the names of the different curing stations. That's the names of them \\nWell Camels was the lower no the bot the one of the bottom of the station was Bert  and he married a Stronsay woman.\",\n",
       " \"A \\nWas he a Stronsay man? No. He was from er East coast and he married er Isa  from . . He married her and they had the one down at the lifeboat slip. And then there was Camels one there. You see that house down there? Yes  \\nWell that was that was my house. oh. That white house. That's the only fishing hut that's standing  in it's original position. And that was Camel's fishing hut. Camel's house. And it's Glen it was we renamed it to Glenmanor. And it's the only house now well I left it I left it five year ago but it still belongs to my son. . And there was that was Camel's and then there was  's right behind it. 's was right behind Camel's. And then at this side there was erm  's and then there was Bruce's. That's it. 's up here. And then  's in this corner here was  's. 's. And then\\nAnd that was  's\\nAye, 's and  's is where the new house . And then they went up to the village and it the first one would been  's, 's and  and  's. and  's and  's, Dan  's and  's . Up there. 's was down here and  's was down here. And then\\nThey were below here you see. And then Papa . And then Papa . Er  's was the first one and then it was er   's, and  's, and then  's and then  's and then  's. That was the five in Papa . And there was  in Papa  too.\",\n",
       " \"Yes I know. Yes. Well \\nNo no it was a Westray man that was in it. It was  that was in it when first  then Jimmy Jim  of Whitehall had it. Well it was that shop . Yes. That shop was taken to Kirkwall and it's now Boondatoon in Old Scapa Road. Mhm. When the first  well Aye  one night we were speaking about this. How many would there have been, there were between five or six thousand people in Stronsay in the height of the fishing year. Yes that would be right. You see there was  eighteen  three times eighteen is fifty four. Fifty  sixty  three times eighteen. Fifteen four women on  's. Maybe there were not that quantity in every one but there would have been twelve or fourteen crews on every station. Then there was all the coopers. There'd have been ten, maybe ten coopers. Then \\nAnd  the coppers were they Stronsay folk that worked up at \\nSome of them and they made them Leslie  and Eric  and James, Jimmy  and Andrew  and Jim  and Georgie  and Jim  and them, they worked in the Wintertime you see and made the barrels. And Johnny . Made the barrels in the Wintertime, to have them ready for the Summer. Yes. Tell me about the coopers. told me names of the curing stations can you mind any of the cooperages that were in the village? Well the cooper the cooperage they would have been one at ,co 's cooperage and then there were one at  's. And that's where the men worked and they just made the barrels in there. So there was just the two \\nMhm. That I can \\nMhm. remember here well that was certainly true for the Wintertime. Yes. But they must have taken an awful lot of barrels away. Oh yes, the stock boats came just like great stacks see them coming along round . Great huge height of all the barrels built up on them. Stock boats came on the first day, they start coming away in May. Yes. And June. And then the Stevedores, there were a lot of Stevedores here belonging to Stronsay. There was Sammy  and Davie  and and er from Comely Bank, Willie  and Jim  they were all Stevedores and Andrew  and They were stevedores you see a lot of . They worked at that just unloading on the boats. And then when the herring went away they had to load them again. Yeah. And er you were speaking about the gut factory. In the Wintertime they had a boat they called the Redloch and she went to Stramness and took sillocks from Stramness and took to the gut factory here in the Wintertime. And my my husband  John  and Peter  and J their father John . Well he was old John . And Peter  and Sandy  and they went back and forth all the Winter with that boat. And took took the sillocks and \\nto the factory  to keep the factory going for the factory you see was up in Hunton's field and there were a lot of Stronsay men in it. Working in it. And that was something that went on all year  \\nIt went on the whole year Yes with the sillocks and things. You could fairly smell it for far enough. Yes. And then the  the hotel\\nNana was mentioning the hotel it's burnt down. Well there was in the summertime well there was a cook and a wait a waitress and a maid. And then there was a a young girl that would wash dishes and do bits of jobs. Yes. That's Nana did you see. She was just twelve when  \\nYes  twelve and thirteen. Twelve and thirteen and I was cook for four years there. And then we had shooters that came, and we'd millionaires among them. Really? Yes. And did they shoot  \\nCame in came to shoot the ducks on the island. They had their valets with them and they were here they would  been maybe I saw them at the time. And my father used to take them out in the boat. Mhm. And around  you know, and they would shoot out of the boat and Jock  used to take them out \\nYes. and Johnny  in their boat. And er  Then there was travellers coming every week. For the they were  to begin with in Stronsay. Yes. And there were travellers coming you see every week for that for that . And then that big h hall at the back of the hotel was a showroom for the travellers to show off their all their stuff. What happened in the Wintertime to the shops then when there wasn't so many folk here? Did they\\nWell they just struggle on in the Wintertime \\nStruggled on. there they are, the shops, that was the shops . Oh there was  's shop and they were a baker and grocer. Whereabouts was that? Well that's Hillside now. have have that house now. it's it's a private house now. And there was W P  that was right alongside them. he was a grocer shop.

And in the summer of course as I said before there was  three ice cream shops and a chip shop and then up the island there was ,, and  that was all\\nup the island. Mhm. So there was a lot of \\nFirst one I mind was the first was the  's Bakery. Peter .\",\n",
       " \"Yes well that was\\nAye. . baker's there when in nineteen thirty five. Aye changed us all like. Mm  January there was what they call the Jo what we always call the Joanna Thor Thorden gale. That was January nineteen thirty seven. The wind blew from the South East for about two weeks and the Joanna Thorden, a Norwegian boat, was lost off Stronsay. That was the worst sea I ever saw. As the high water mark was half up to to what we call the outer bogs at Houseby. And the driftwood was lying away up the field. Also barrels of apples and tobacco and many other useful items that had been part of the boat's cargo were strewn all along the beach. The dyke at Gripness was laid flat by the sea but the smaller boats had been pulled up afore that .\",\n",
       " \"Aye. Hadn't they before the . That was just  I c Were the men lost off it? Well there were a boat lost yes and there were women in it mind and that and bairns. Yes.\",\n",

      "Well, I'll tell you an interesting story about how I got my dog,\n",
      "and then I suppose our five minutes will be up.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I work for a university,\n",
      "and I went to, uh, Omaha, Nebraska to recruit students,\n",
      "and I had some time off in the afternoon,\n",
      "so I went to a, a pet shop,\n",
      "and I saw these little Springer Spaniels\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "and so I decided, well, you know, this would really be a nice dog to have,\n",
      "so, when I got back home to Carney, Nebraska, I told my wife about it,\n",
      "and I said, You know, this is just a,\n",
      "I, I, I can just hear the dog crying for me now\n",
      "I know what you mean.\n",
      "And Christmas is coming up, hint, hint,\n",
      "and so, I had to go back the next week, as well as a bunch of other people from the university,\n",
      "and one of the people, uh, that we went with, uh, they were friends of ours,\n",
      "and so, we got to Omaha,\n",
      "and I decided I'd take my friend over and show him the dog,\n",
      "and so I got over there,\n",
      "and she said, Oh, that's too bad, the dog has already been sold.\n",
      "And I didn't realize it,\n",
      "but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier, bought the dog,\n",
      "and she was in the back room,\n",
      "and so that night we had a reception for some of the, uh, potential high school students or college students,\n",
      "and, and, uh, he had the dog the whole time in his room,\n",
      "and, and I had no idea.\n",
      "And so we headed back to Carney that night,\n",
      "and the dog rode in the car\n",
      "and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat\n",
      "and they left the dog in the car,\n",
      "and I guess while we were inside eating, Thumper just tore the heck out of the inside of the car,\n",
      "and, uh, finally we made it back to, uh, to Carney\n",
      "and,\n",
      "I guess we're recorded.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "What,\n",
      "do you have any hobbies that you like to do?\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "Cycling, computers, uh, backpacking, just about everything.\n",
      "Oh\n",
      "Oh, I generically have, you know, millions of hobbies.\n",
      "All right,\n",
      "that's an interesting assortment.\n",
      "My husband is into cycling.\n",
      "In fact, he's out there right now before it gets dark trying to get in his miles for the, the time.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I'm not quite that bad.\n",
      "I'm just a weekend cyclist.\n",
      "Uh, do you have any, do you do any handicraft type things, I think was the question.\n",
      "Handicraft type things.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "whittling or\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "just whittle away my life.\n",
      "Uh, no,\n",
      "no,\n",
      "I\n",
      "Nothing like that.\n",
      "Uh, uh,\n",
      "I, I do some things.\n",
      "I've gotten into,\n",
      "uh, oh, I, I like to decorate things\n",
      "and I do sweatshirts and T-shirts\n",
      "and I've gotten to where I start, have started selling them at craft shows and things.\n",
      "Oh, that's pretty good.\n",
      "Uh, and I have, have done fairly well at them.\n",
      "I've had\n",
      "a, a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed,\n",
      "but most of them have worked out pretty good\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they,\n",
      "my only craft work is kind of like computers and, you know, go off to the little computer club meetings,\n",
      "and, it's kind of nice because I've made money at it, too.\n",
      "Considering I, I work for it a living,\n",
      "but I, you know, I, I've got a couple of articles published.\n",
      "Oh!\n",
      "It's kind of, kind of neat.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "what, what does a computer club do.\n",
      "I didn't know there were such things.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "just all over the place.\n",
      "They just get around and, and talk techy or, or else, uh, uh, you know,\n",
      "like half the members are really expert\n",
      "and the other half are like really not.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, we kind of help out the people who are really not\n",
      "You don't, uh, you're not into hacking or whatever\n",
      "Oh, I, I think I'm, I think I'm a hacker,\n",
      "but I'm not, not kind, not the, uh, the, you know, dial around randomly trying to break into computers type hackers,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "no,\n",
      "that's one of those sports I don't go for.\n",
      "Well, that's kind of interesting hobby.\n",
      "What else, did you,\n",
      "you said you did cycling?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "What was the other thing?\n",
      "Backpacking.\n",
      "Backpacking.\n",
      "We,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I belong to a, a Boy Scout troop.\n",
      "It beats paying United Way.\n",
      "I just, you know donate a whole bunch of my time to the Boy Scouts and have fun.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, that's, we have done that.\n",
      "Uh, our two older boys were in Boy Scouts\n",
      "and my daughter was in Girl Scouts until just about a year ago\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so we've uh, done a fair amount of that in our spare time, also\n",
      "But, it,\n",
      "I,\n",
      "that's a great thing to do, you know, really.\n",
      "Have you been backpacking anyplace exciting?\n",
      "Uh, well, just last weekend went to Davy Crockett forest which is kind of out in east Texas.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And we go to, uh, places out in,\n",
      "uh, uh, let's see\n",
      "what's that, what's that state north of us,\n",
      "that state\n",
      "Oh, that one.\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that one.\n",
      "That one.\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "And,\n",
      "To the,\n",
      "uh, oh, by Fort Sill there?\n",
      "Uh, no,\n",
      "to another a, uh, old Indian fort that's out there.\n",
      "Trying to think of the name of it.\n",
      "Durn.\n",
      "Well, yeah,\n",
      "no,\n",
      "sorry,\n",
      "no memory.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Have you gone, like to Fillmont with the Boy Scouts?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I missed out this last year.\n",
      "I wasn't able to get the time off, but maybe next year.\n",
      "It's a good possibility.\n",
      "I've always thought that would be a real fun thing to do.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "When I was a kid, uh, we'd do the equivalent thing in the High Sierras.\n",
      "That was loads of fun.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Does, does your whole family like to do it,\n",
      "like you, you know, for a vacation you'd go backpacking?\n",
      "Uh, no,\n",
      "not quite because I'm not a whole family.\n",
      "I'm just me\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "You just, oh,\n",
      "and, and you volunteer for the Boy Scouts, huh?\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "I rent my kids\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "Well, sometimes, uh,\n",
      "It's better than, you know, owning on them and making payments on them, and, you know, things like that.\n",
      "Sometimes I think that might not be a bad idea\n",
      "Have,\n",
      "uh, you said you did it in the High Sierras.\n",
      "Uh, do you ever, you know, just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack?\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Uh, not recently because, you know, like the Boy Scouts makes it so that I go like once a month, you know. Someplace.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, uh, there's, uh, some, some stuff that I want to do with like Sierra Club and go down to Grand Canyon or something like that.\n",
      "So, you know, they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and off you go.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Which seems kind of reasonable because that means you don't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you, which seems a, a, just a tad more relaxing\n",
      "Well, I,\n",
      "probably,\n",
      "probably.\n",
      "That's,\n",
      "uh, well, my, my other things that I like to do in my spare time, I'm, I like swimming.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Which is in now.\n",
      "I've done that\n",
      "and I, I also,\n",
      "when I like something, I usually try to figure out how to make money off of it.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "is it Mike?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Do you repair your own car?\n",
      "I try to, whenever I can.\n",
      "I've always been a, a I guess a product of a handyman father.\n",
      "Well, I tell you what, that's, count your blessings because uh, it really is good when someone can do some things to a car themselves.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "There's,\n",
      "although I'll tell you, you know, over the years the cars get more complicated.\n",
      "Well, that's why I don't do as much as I'd like.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Because they are, I mean they've got, they've gotten complicated haven't they?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "One of my first cars was a fifty-six Buick. Which, after awhile I could, you know, take it apart in my sleep if I needed to.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It, it got to be pretty straightforward to understand\n",
      "and, now since then, you know, the closer a car is to a fifty-six Buick, the, the more I know about it.\n",
      "And then start getting into these Nissans and the like\n",
      "and I just can't keep up.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, I agree.\n",
      "About all I ever,\n",
      "I never was too mechanically inclined,\n",
      "but I used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Course, they don't use, uh, points anymore.\n",
      "That's right\n",
      "But, Uh, they do still use plugs.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, uh, now brakes, I've always done a lot of, you know, changing brakes.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I used to do, I could always do the alternator, you know, and starter.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I don't anymore,\n",
      "but I have on a lot, a lot of times.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I understand.\n",
      "My last car repair actually had to do with brakes\n",
      "and it's one I did not do myself.\n",
      "I took the car, my,\n",
      "I have a seventy-nine El Dorado, took it to be inspected\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and the parking brake failed.\n",
      "So I got under there and messed with the, the that, uh, that adjustment to make, to tighten it up\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and that didn't do the trick\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and then I got there and tried to,\n",
      "It probably slipped loose, didn't it?\n",
      "Well, actually that wasn't even eventually the problem.\n",
      "I, I did a lot of things that I, I did everything that I could think to do.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, eventually I brought it up to a, a place called Just Brakes\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it turns out that there's a,\n",
      "the parking brake in the rear,\n",
      "there's a, there's disc brakes\n",
      "and the parking brake is a piston deal.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "And because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years, the piston froze up.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "So they ended up having to pound it out.\n",
      "And one of them, they, were able to get running, uh, kind of oiling it and playing with it\n",
      "and the other one they just, it was just frozen solid,\n",
      "so I ended up having to buy one\n",
      "and all total, it was just under two hundred dollars, believe it or not, to get all that done\n",
      "well, it really wasn't quite, as bad as you thought, was it, was it?\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "actually, I, I think it was a lot of money,\n",
      "but I, I don't, like I\n",
      "Well, it was a lot of money,\n",
      "but,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but, I,\n",
      "it got to the point where I didn't know what was going on\n",
      "so,\n",
      "You had to have the help, didn't you?\n",
      "That's right,\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, do you still do much work on them, then?\n",
      "I do.\n",
      "actually that was just a, at, at the beginning of September\n",
      "and, whenever I can, I do try.\n",
      "I\n",
      "actually, I'd say this.\n",
      "I, I've gotten to the point where I don't change the oil anymore. Only because,\n",
      "Disposal is a problem.\n",
      "Well, that is one problem,\n",
      "but also these, uh, these fast oil change places, you just can't beat them.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "For sixteen bucks they'll not only will they change the oil in ten minutes, and do a you know, as good a job as I can do, but they'll, uh, lube, too\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "that, that,\n",
      "I've, I've quit doing that myself.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil, you know.\n",
      "Yep,\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "And, uh, but, it,\n",
      "but, no,\n",
      "I guess,\n",
      "that,\n",
      "and the main reason that it's, it's quick.\n",
      "Well, have you seen a new movie lately?\n",
      "Well, uh, I am a student\n",
      "and I have, uh, been actually watching more movies on video, than being able to go out to see, uh, movies at the store, or at the theater.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, I I want to see the FISHER KING and, and, uh, catch ROBIN HOOD.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I, uh, I haven't seen either one of those.\n",
      "Uh, what, what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though?\n",
      "Uh, let's see.\n",
      "Uh, I'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on.\n",
      "Uh, WHITE PALACE which I thought was over rated, over hyped, um, recently.\n",
      "Well, you're catching me at, it, uh, uh, at mind's end here.\n",
      "What have you seen recently?\n",
      "Well, maybe you, uh, you have seen DANCES WITH WOLVES.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "What did you think of that one?\n",
      "Enjoyed that quite a bit.\n",
      "Um, I thought the, uh, the the cinematography was excellent.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, the story was,\n",
      "uh, though it tended to be a little one sided uh, it was good.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, it was, it was believable.\n",
      "I, uh, I just moved down, in fact, from South Dakota in, in June,\n",
      "and that's when the movie was filmed,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, we, when, when the movie came out, we went,\n",
      "uh, my dad lives in the state capital, which is Pierre\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it was filmed right outside of Pierre.\n",
      "In fact, the buffalo, the scene, the big buffalo herd scene, that was, that was a live scene.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Uh, there's a guy that has got a, a buffalo farm,\n",
      "and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo and, and, uh, we, my dad has got a little plane, we flew over it all looked at the buffalo,\n",
      "it was really neat.\n",
      "But, uh, so we are watching the, the movie in the movie theater in Pierre\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, just every time I would start to get into the movie, and it was getting good someone in the crowd would yell, hey, there's John Red Eagle, you know\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "or, you know, they'd start recognizing people.\n",
      "They knew, they knew the extras or the,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, I kind of, I think I enjoyed it more when I, when I watched it on video cassette than I did, uh, in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they'd say that.\n",
      "I'd go now, now which one could that be you know,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I'd, I'd start trying to focus in on people instead of, of picking up the overall,\n",
      "Scope.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, but I, I thought it was a good film.\n",
      "But you are right,\n",
      "I think, I think it was very one sided.\n",
      "It, it was,\n",
      "but it's a side that hasn't been told. Uh, as far as, you know, telling it from, you know, the Indians as the good guys and the, the white men as the bad guys.\n",
      "I, I really thought about, uh, all the, the westerns that we have seen for years and years,\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "and it's just, shoot the Indians,\n",
      "and they are always the savages.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "In fact, I was watching WILD WILD WEST last night\n",
      "and, it was a similar, uh, situation with the Iroquois Indians attacking a, an army fort.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, but it was an interesting movie.\n",
      "Uh, have you seen PRETTY WOMAN?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Now I thought that was a good show.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That was, that was a good movie.\n",
      "Um, it was just kind of a get away movie.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Kind of,\n",
      "It didn't, uh, it didn't have any real social bearing\n",
      "or, uh, and it wasn't really a comedy,\n",
      "but it was an enjoyable movie.\n",
      "It was, it was kind of like the STAR WARS series, you know, just something a little different,  yet believable.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "You're bringing it,\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "I had a, I sure did have a mind lock about the movies I've seen.\n",
      "But, yeah,\n",
      "I've seen PRETTY WOMAN and DANCES WITH WOLVES,\n",
      "and, uh,\n",
      "Uh, now are you, are you going to see, or do you, are you much of a STAR TREK fan,\n",
      "are you going to see this next one that's coming out?\n",
      "Oh, definitely.\n",
      "Have you seen the rest?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I think I've missed one.\n",
      "I'm not sure,\n",
      "but I think I've missed one.\n",
      "I actually went to the STAR TREK twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago,\n",
      "and they showed all five in a row.\n",
      "Was that here in Dallas?\n",
      "Oh, they had it everywhere,\n",
      "uh, every major city had one theater that did it\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Because we had one here in Dallas.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "and they did it in Houston,\n",
      "they did it, well, they did it everywhere.\n",
      "And it was, it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed,\n",
      "and the thing that I didn't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row, uh, time wise they happen one after another and just no, no time between them,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but you can watch the characters develop,\n",
      "I said Arlington, Texas because the other day, I was talking with somebody\n",
      "and he was in Arlington, Virginia\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's the only one I've got now for this area.\n",
      "Oh, gosh, oh, gosh.\n",
      "Well, anyway, we've got a easy subject.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "we do.\n",
      "You go ahead first, if you'd like.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "let me think here.\n",
      "Favorite,\n",
      "I haven't been watching much T V lately\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "you know you get so busy.\n",
      "I used to.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I have, uh, I have one favorite soap opera.\n",
      "I still watch\n",
      "and I tape because I'm not home\n",
      "Oh,\n",
      "And, uh, let's see,\n",
      "that's GENERAL HOSPITAL,\n",
      "and then, uh, at night, uh, I don't, uh, when I sit down, I don't usually sit down till almost nine o'clock when my kids get in bed\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "and, and, uh, then I watch,\n",
      "uh, what do I watch at nine o'clock.\n",
      "Let's see,\n",
      "oh, well, Tuesday nights I guess, we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And, uh,\n",
      "Are they little?\n",
      "I have a seven year old and a ten year old.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they're pretty young.\n",
      "And, uh, so we usually catch, uh, FULL HOUSE,\n",
      "and, uh, what's the one comes on after that.\n",
      "It's a new one, uh,\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "my kids are older\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so I don't, I don't know some of those shows now, like I used to\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Uh, other than that, uh, oh, gosh. I watch KNOTS LANDING on Thursday nights, for pure entertainment, nothing else.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well I, I like the comedies.\n",
      "They're just light, too.\n",
      "I have to watch MURPHY BROWN\n",
      "I really like,\n",
      "Oh, now that is a good one.\n",
      "I make a point of that.\n",
      "That is.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "if I'm home on Mondays, then I, I definitely watch her.\n",
      "I love that\n",
      "and I really like COACH.\n",
      "I think it's, when it's good, it's just a scream.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "well, he's a good actor.\n",
      "He really is good.\n",
      "Well, he's probably playing himself.\n",
      "Half the time you see these people on an interview show, they're, they act just like they do in their parts\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "He,\n",
      "I saw him on JOHNNY CARSON once\n",
      "and he acted about the same\n",
      "Oh, God.\n",
      "Well, he could very well be\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and, uh,\n",
      "So, do you watch much T V,\n",
      "or,\n",
      "Well, I watch more now because, well I, I had been going to school for years and have really been too busy\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but this semester I'm only taking one course\n",
      "and so I see MURPHY BROWN and COACH and THE WONDER YEARS.\n",
      "I just make a point of seeing those.\n",
      "Now, I never see that.\n",
      "Well, I've got a friend that says that is just wonderful show.\n",
      "Oh, it's fabulous.\n",
      "Really, you should never miss that.\n",
      "It, they are just gems of shows. I mean, they really, fabulous in every way\n",
      "Oh, nice.\n",
      "What, now what night is that on now?\n",
      "Oh, that's Wednesday at, uh, seven thirty.\n",
      "Wednesday at seven thirty,\n",
      "oh, okay.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "Wednesdays I, I go to church choir,\n",
      "so That's my one night out and about,\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Sure,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "well, maybe, maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I should get him to do that.  Because I know,\n",
      "Just so you get the idea.\n",
      "It wouldn't take,  Wouldn't take much to get hooked on those\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "So, so, I watch those.\n",
      "Are there any new ones this year that came out that you like\n",
      "or,\n",
      "Well, you know, I haven't, oh,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "we started watching NORTHERN EXPOSURE.\n",
      "Well, it's not really new,\n",
      "but it's still kind of new.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "How's that?\n",
      "I haven't seen that.\n",
      "I like it a lot.\n",
      "It's real different.\n",
      "In fact, they never thought it would be a hit.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "I mean, they'll have some things in there that almost, almost, you know, like supernatural, or something,\n",
      "you know, I mean, somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does\n",
      "or, I mean, it sounds weird,\n",
      "but, it's very, uh, unique show and very well done.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Excellent actors.\n",
      "I'll have to watch for that.\n",
      "I, I guess we just,\n",
      "it came on after something we used to watch\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "and I guess we just kept sitting there\n",
      "and then now we make a point of watching\n",
      "I can't take all these shows on because next semester I'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television.\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "Well then, it will be mostly reruns, I guess\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "And by the end of February, the way they do it nowadays.\n",
      "Gosh. Well, we used to watch a lot of DESIGNING WOMEN,\n",
      "But, uh,\n",
      "but, uh I haven't seen that much lately. Since they got rid of, uh, Delta Burke and, uh brought on the new ones.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I've seen that.\n",
      "Was she the, was she the best one? Was she the best one on that old show?\n",
      "Oh, she was just funny.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "She was really funny.\n",
      "And her character was good.\n",
      "I don't know that it was her in particular but just the character.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "So, uh,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they had a big fight on that show, didn't they?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "They were all accusing each other of everything in the world\n",
      "Oh, that was awful\n",
      "and who knows still, what really happened, you know.\n",
      "Well, I know,\n",
      "gosh, you never will, probably.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Well, I think the latest soap opera for people is the Kennedy trial for those who have cable.\n",
      "Oh, I know.\n",
      "I don't have cable.\n",
      "Now I told ,\n",
      "no,\n",
      "we don't have that station either,\n",
      "so, uh, I haven't been able to catch any of that,\n",
      "but just what little we caught on the news.\n",
      "It's just as wild as any soap opera, from what I hear on the news.\n",
      "Oh, I know it.\n",
      "And I think he's guilty as the devil.\n",
      "Well, I don't see how he couldn't be, you know.\n",
      "I know,\n",
      "what's in it for her.\n",
      "There's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that. Because you know they tear you to shreds, especially those rich high powered lawyers.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "Oh, and they said this lawyer is unbelievable.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "But, they said she held up so well yesterday.\n",
      "I know,\n",
      "everybody was saying that\n",
      "and then, in the paper said it\n",
      "so, It should be interesting.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh, God.\n",
      "Well, the NATIONAL ENQUIRER says\n",
      "I was reading that in the supermarket line.\n",
      "I never have the nerve to buy the thing.\n",
      "Uh,\n",
      "Oh, shoot,\n",
      "well, do you watch any, uh any sports or anything like that\n",
      "Says he,\n",
      "or,\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I don't care anything about that.\n",
      "Because I don't either.\n",
      "I can't, I can't watch it on T V,\n",
      "so\n",
      "I like the ice skating,\n",
      "you know, occasionally, some ice skating will come on, on a Sunday or during the Olympics\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I always watch that.\n",
      "I think it's so beautiful.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I like to catch the gymnastics sometimes, too.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "that's good.\n",
      "Well, I suppose we both have credit cards.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "they seem to be a part of life\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "how do you use them?\n",
      "Well, I do use them.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, I have a few favorites that I use more than others\n",
      "and, uh, I try to keep my balances fairly reasonable.\n",
      "I, I could probably pay them off any month if I wanted to.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when, when you start using more than a few\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, they all can build up.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, I think they're handy.\n",
      "I just get, uh,\n",
      "I don't carry a lot of cash with me\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, I hate writing checks when you go shopping.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, do you use credit cards?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I use a few.\n",
      "I, uh, I watched my grandmother go into debt on them\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and so I've,\n",
      "and then I guess my  mother,\n",
      "Grandmother\n",
      "huh?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "so my mother learned from that\n",
      "and I guess she taught me to be very, very careful with them.\n",
      "So basically, uh, I just keep them,\n",
      "I use them so that I build up a credit rating, you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, otherwise, uh, I generally,\n",
      "and my husband, it turns out,\n",
      "I've just been married seven months,\n",
      "but he has the same habit\n",
      "and we just keep a few you know, few of the major ones, and then use them once in a while for something,\n",
      "That's good.\n",
      "but we always pay it off right that month so that we don't pay any service charge.\n",
      "Oh that's, That's wonderful.\n",
      "So that way we keep out of debt\n",
      "and we keep on top of what we're spending.\n",
      "Well, the interest rates in credit cards is so high now  compared to what your savings is bringing.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's really, I guess ridiculous to let them keep building.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "that's what I feel.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "But I know some people can get, get, you know, carried away with them and let them get out of hand.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's really easy, just to forget, you know, that you, you charged that or charged that.\n",
      "I try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where I know that the bill's going to come,\n",
      "but sometimes I forget\n",
      "and so, you know, a bill will come in\n",
      "and I'll think, oh, no I didn't know it was going to be that high.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "But so far, I've been able to, we've been able to pay it off every time\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Well, that's good.\n",
      "I'm looking, right now I'm kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate.\n",
      "It seems that some of them have gotten higher\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, I saw on T V, they had a program on, uh, credit cards\n",
      "and they're supposed to,\n",
      "I don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some, some other state had a Visa card that was the lowest one in the country.\n",
      "And I didn't write it down at the time\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and then I went and looked and, to see what my visa was\n",
      "and I think it's eighteen percent or something\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "so, think I want to find something that has a lower rate.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Have you ever used Discover card?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I haven't.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I'm not even sure what their interest rate is since I pay it off\n",
      "but you know,\n",
      "Is that the one from Sears?\n",
      "Uh, I think Sears originally put it out,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "but it's, uh, it's pretty well taken all over the U S now.\n",
      "I mean, uh, I've haven't found many places that don't take Discover.\n",
      "And there's no annual service fee, which is good.\n",
      "Okay .\n",
      "You know, and then, uh, they also give you, they say cash back, uh, like at the end of the year.\n",
      "For the amount that I charge, I get two dollars back or something\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back.\n",
      "Oh, they give you money back for using your credit card.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "basically.\n",
      "Oh\n",
      "That's it.\n",
      "I didn't know that.\n",
      "And I think the service charge is pretty low, too,\n",
      "but, I'm not sure.\n",
      "Um. Well, you know, Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I worked at Sears for over ten years\n",
      "and, uh, it was only a Sears card that they would take until I guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card, another credit card that was accepted,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so, you know, now they'll take the Discover,\n",
      "but I still don't know if Sears will take Visa or Mastercard.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, uh  I never did apply for a Discover card.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I just figure with the Visa and American Express, I probably have an,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I can do enough damage with those two.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I think it's best to keep the number down that you have.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "I've got some that I, you know, I haven't even used at all, uh, past few years\n",
      "I probably wouldn't be able to use them.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, uh, I, I do like my Dillard's,\n",
      "I have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I do use Dillard's probably as, more than any of the other department stores.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, Do you have anything else to say?\n",
      "Well,\n",
      "No,\n",
      "not too much more about credit cards\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "I don't think I do either\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "well,\n",
      "Well, it was good talking to you.\n",
      "Good talking to you Beth.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Good luck.\n",
      "Have a good evening.\n",
      "You, too.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "Well, got any problems on Mockingbird with crime\n",
      "or is that a crime free zone there?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I don't think there is any such thing, as a crime free zone any longer.\n",
      "I'm afraid you're right.\n",
      "Uh, one evening I decided to retire early and heard sirens and noises and thought, oh, well, something's happens on Mockingbird and then heard yells and screams\n",
      "and the next thing I know there are policemen all around my house.\n",
      "Oh, my.\n",
      "And they had stopped a, uh, a stolen car and caught one of the men in the hedge\n",
      "Oh, boy.\n",
      "and then the other one was on the roof in the back.\n",
      "By your house?\n",
      "on my house\n",
      "Oh, my goodness.\n",
      "Aye, aye, aye Oh, my.\n",
      "So I'm very much aware of, uh, crime in the cities and the, and the concern about it.\n",
      "That's, that's got to be a frightening way to spend an evening.\n",
      "It was.\n",
      "I, uh, I kept hearing noises\n",
      "and so I, I knew that I was not going to sleep until I got up and went out and checked the garage,\n",
      "so I got a my gun and walked to the, you know, through the house into the garage.\n",
      "There was no one there,\n",
      "but I wanted to be sure.\n",
      "Oh, boy.\n",
      "Is Plano beginning to experience the, the kinds of things that are more common in the metropolitan, you know, in the urban area?\n",
      "Unfortunately yes.\n",
      "That's too bad.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I think, uh, you know, as any city grows up, uh, you get the hoods and the riffraff and everybody else in there,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I think,\n",
      "uh, you know, fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on Spring Creek,\n",
      "but, uh, we've been, we've lived here sixteen years\n",
      "and now you, you know, you can tell the change, for sure.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, I was thinking, if you've been there that long, you've seen Plano grow from what was really a, a small town to a city.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Well, with all the, uh, Central Expressway, uh, with all the stores and the, uh, restaurants and the uh, convenience stores and all that kind of stuff, it's just prime pickings for people driving by.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You know and,\n",
      "Well, I was appalled to read the other day about the, uh, uh, shooting on the tollway.\n",
      "That's, that couldn't be too far from you, neither.\n",
      "Uh, well, it's farther west of me.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I live over near White Rock Lake.\n",
      "Oh, yes,\n",
      "okay.\n",
      "But, uh,\n",
      "uh, it was really frightening to, think that, uh, it's not even safe to drive onto the tollway, or for those people in the tollbooth.\n",
      "Uh, I never thought about someone robbing those,\n",
      "but, apparently, they do.\n",
      "I don't know, uh, how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody\n",
      "but,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it just doesn't seem possible, does it.\n",
      "It's kind of, kind of stupid, isn't it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But I guess when people do those things, they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time.\n",
      "It's, looks like easy pickings\n",
      "No.\n",
      "and away you go, right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and I think the drugs play a tremendous part in, uh, the theft and the, the violence that we see.\n",
      "I think you're right, uh, although I think that may be an excuse for people, too.\n",
      "It, it is convenient, isn't it?\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I didn't know what I was doing.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "That kind.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "just like the old alcohol idea\n",
      "and I think people, uh, I think when you have haves and have nots, you're always going to find people that are too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, yes,\n",
      "and I work in South Dallas for the Dallas School System.\n",
      "Oh, boy.\n",
      "And, uh, uh,\n",
      "Where do you work?\n",
      "Uh, do you know where Oakland and Hatcher are?\n",
      "Uh, yes,\n",
      "I think I do.\n",
      "That, uh, is that Amelia Earhart, School there?\n",
      "Uh, no\n",
      "this is over near Lincoln High School. Uh, just, not far off South Central Expressway.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That's a pretty rough area there, isn't it?\n",
      "It is a pretty rough area.\n",
      "We're over by Fair Park.\n",
      "Oh, my goodness.\n",
      "And, uh, you know, you watch the people.\n",
      "There are marvelous B M W and Mercedes and Cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "And the kids see that\n",
      "and, uh, they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day where, uh, you know, running for, uh, drug dealers if,\n",
      "Definitely that area, that, that's big time.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Big time there, sure is.\n",
      "It surely is.\n",
      "I don't think I'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself .\n",
      "Well, I'm careful.\n",
      "that's the worst neighborhood in the whole area.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's, uh, a little scary sometimes\n",
      "and, uh, I manage the,\n",
      "Well, credit cards\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'll tell you what, I, I can't say a whole lot about credit cards because I, uh, tore mine up.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "I, I know I know some other people that have done that.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh, I got in some problems with, uh, financial problems because of credit cards\n",
      "so I, uh, basically just got rid of all of them.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "I, I have a, a couple.\n",
      "I have a, uh, gas card that I, that I use just for gas and you know, uh, one that I use just for emergencies\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "but,\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I I have, we have some, some friends that did the, exactly the same thing.\n",
      "They, uh, you know, they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed\n",
      "and finally they realized that they were, they were abusing them and weren't going to get out of the hole\n",
      "and they just cut them all up except for, for one they kept for emergencies\n",
      "and they're still paying away to get out of debt.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I know it.\n",
      "But, no,\n",
      "I did just the opposite.\n",
      "I, I guess I, I sort of followed in my, uh, parents' footsteps.\n",
      "I have quite a few of them.\n",
      "I use them continually,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but I, uh, I basically never charge anything I don't have the money in the bank to pay for.\n",
      "And, uh, and I always pay them off totally every month.\n",
      "Oh, is that right?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's a, that's a good policy.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and it, you know, I mean, they, they're just a convenience for me.\n",
      "I don't have to get cash out of the bank,\n",
      "and I don't have to to be writing checks\n",
      "and and, uh,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh, sometimes I wish I had them,\n",
      "but in most cases, I'm glad I don't  because I, you know, unfortunately I, I, I don't have the control you have\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I wish I did,\n",
      "but but I don't.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, and it, you know, it,\n",
      "I just don't want to get into that situation again,\n",
      "so we'll,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I mean, it, it's easy,\n",
      "I mean, you don't have anything transferring, just a little signature,\n",
      "so what, you know\n",
      "Oh, that's it.\n",
      "See, and that's,\n",
      "even with my gas card you know, I find that I'll go in to get some gas\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I'll end up buying, you know, candy and drinks and you know, sweets and whatever,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and then at the end of the month I, you know, I get a bill\n",
      "and I'm thinking what did I get, that costs so much.\n",
      "Surprising.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And,\n",
      "Well, you know, but the,\n",
      "I mean, there are sort some inherent limits there,\n",
      "you're not going to, you're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that, that's true,\n",
      "but I can, I can certainly understand where\n",
      "Now I,\n",
      "You know,\n",
      "the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really, you know, uh, not so much discipline,\n",
      "I mean, well, I mean, you have sort of a discipline in general about finances,\n",
      "but, but I hate their, their rates so badly, I mean their interest rates so badly  that I,\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Isn't it,\n",
      "that's unbelievable.\n",
      "How,\n",
      "let me ask you this.\n",
      "How, how old are you?\n",
      "I'm, uh, thirty-three.\n",
      "Thirty-three?\n",
      "Thirty-two,\n",
      "excuse me.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You'll be thirty-three this year?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You want to be thirty-two as long as you can, huh.\n",
      "It's coming.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, I know what you mean about the interest rates. It's, uh, it's unbelievable.\n",
      "You know, I just, that just irritates me so much that, that I refuse to pay them interest\n",
      "and, and my wife recently, uh, decided she had to go to Brazil and was going to take off\n",
      "and, she's from there and and, uh, didn't really have the money,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, you know, she could pay it off,\n",
      "and so I, sort of reluctantly let her put it on credit cards,\n",
      "but she's paying it,\n",
      "and, uh, I just won't do it.\n",
      "I mean, she's paying, I don't know, I don't know what per month, you know, forty, fifty dollars per month in interest\n",
      "Oh, jeez.\n",
      "and I just, you know, I just refuse to give it to them.\n",
      "If I need to borrow that kind of money, I'll go to the bank\n",
      "and, uh,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and then, you bet.\n",
      "You know.\n",
      "That's,\n",
      "uh, yeah,\n",
      "I, in fact, I've, I've even, uh, heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less, uh rates and have paid off their, you know higher interest rate, uh cards and just sent them back, you know.\n",
      "Income.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And I, I guess there's some, there's, uh, uh, some negotiating there, too,\n",
      "because I heard, uh,\n",
      "on one of the local talk shows here, they had somebody on and, and said, what you can do is, uh, call, you know,\n",
      "if you've got a pretty good rating, uh, credit rating you can call your you know, your, your card, wherever you got your card from and tell them, hey, either drop my rates or drop my, you know, uh annual fees or I'll just go to somewhere else.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "High,\n",
      "I might,\n",
      "You know, and if you've got, if you've got a pretty good uh, uh, history with them they're more than willing to do that.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Um, I might try that because I, I have one card that I've had for about, uh, I don't know, nine or ten years.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "in fact, that's, that's what this guy,\n",
      "you know, he wrote a book on it\n",
      "and he says that's, you know, he's tried it with several of his cards\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and he's just told them, you know, I, I can get this card from this bank at this rate\n",
      "and yours is at, you know, eighteen or nineteen percent.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "It does not make sense for me to do that\n",
      "and if you won't drop my rates, I'll just go ahead and send you back your card\n",
      "and I'll go somewhere else and get it.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "for me the big thing, you know, is the, uh, uh, is the annual fee\n",
      "and I just refuse,\n",
      "I won't get any card now,\n",
      "I've, I've got a good rating\n",
      "and I've got, you know,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I'm not going, I'm not going to pay an annual fee.\n",
      "The only one I actually pay on is this one that I, that, the very first,\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "Hi,\n",
      "my name is Dolphene.\n",
      "I live in Texas.\n",
      "Hi,\n",
      "my name is Pat Johnson\n",
      "and I live in Texas too.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "I work for T I,\n",
      "do, do you also?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I live in Dallas.\n",
      "I work for the Dallas school system.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "uh, you ready to begin?\n",
      "We might as well.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I understand we are doing care of the elderly, right?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "And how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home?\n",
      "Well, I don't think that uh, any of my relatives would really like to go there.\n",
      "I, I believe, if I, am in a position, uh, like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that I will be able to just bring her into my home and my father also, and uh, or have someone go into their home, you know and uh, and look after them.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That way.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I would find it very difficult, uh, to, uh, place my father or my step-mother uh, in a place like that. Particularly, since I know how they feel about it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "it's basically, it's more how they feel about it.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "And it is like they feel, they are, uh, the way my mother would put it like somebody had thrown them away You know?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for, you know, if you are faced with placing someone. In a place like that, uh, you know, aside from the cleanliness and the medical care that is offered and such\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference.\n",
      "And I have a a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home and has no family who, you know, could care for her.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, I know that the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about, uh, her situation.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And another thing to think about, uh, on the positive side of the nursing homes here,\n",
      "I use to work in one of the offices in a nursing home\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I got to see a lot of the things that they did\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "they, uh, they had a lot of crafts\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "and they had a lot of games\n",
      "and, uh, they, get together and just do, they they do all sorts of things\n",
      "and then there\n",
      "some, some of the, uh, the people that are in there are real, you know, very nice and friendly to everybody\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, then there are others that are,\n",
      "uh, it is just a job\n",
      "and they just you know want to go in and do what they have to do and get out go home.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, the, the attitude of the staff as you said is really very very important.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I think it would matter too, uh, kinds of, uh, disabilities that the nursing home accepts. Because there are some, uh, who poor things, you know, don't have, uh, any real grasp on reality any longer.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And they may be ambulatory,\n",
      "but they tend to behave like children, small children\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and that would be very difficult I think for an adult who wasn't in that situation to to have to deal with on a daily basis.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "Well, it is like, the one that I worked in, uh, you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day,\n",
      "they would just roll themselves around all over the place\n",
      "and and they would enjoy enjoy themselves with activities\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "and then you would see see some of the others that are were like distant from the other group\n",
      "and they they just didn't like participate together with the others because they had some some, uh, I guess, uh, slight mental disabilities and things like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "What, what do you call Alzheimer disease and stuff like that\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "Alzheimer,\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "and they don't, don't, uh, they weren't really together with the rest of them, when they got together for such activities.\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "and that can,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So Frank, what, uh, type of, uh, budget do you or your family have?\n",
      "Well, uh I don't know that we really have a budget.\n",
      "I have a set amount that I, that I save.\n",
      "Actually, well actually there is a, a way,\n",
      "budget our money apparently.\n",
      "The,\n",
      "uh, my wife, uh, has so much, uh, gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks\n",
      "and, uh, we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff, gas, and things like that\n",
      "and besides that I, uh, you know, I have a set amount that I save every month.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "That's, uh, sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I am single,\n",
      "so. I guess, I don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but I basically,\n",
      "Really don't need to.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "I don't need to.\n",
      "I am the only that I have to keep track of\n",
      "so it makes it a little bit easier.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Uh, and also I, you know, I try to save a certain amount each month as well\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, I try to, try to have an idea of what my expenses are\n",
      "and I am pretty consistent from month to month\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, whenever, uh, I need to, uh, whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Well, I found that, uh, you know, things, as I have gotten older,\n",
      "I am in my fifties now,\n",
      "but before we use to have, to have to have a very strict budget,\n",
      "I had four kids\n",
      "and, uh, you know we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for, for this and for that.\n",
      "Kind of anticipate how much things were going to be.\n",
      "Uh, I guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting I do now is that I set aside, uh, I kind of fence off areas of my check book.\n",
      "For instance, there are certain things that I know come up, uh, every so often.\n",
      "Every six months I have to pay car insurance.\n",
      "Uh, every six months I have to pay my taxes.\n",
      "So I take a set amount.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I've got a money market account that I do a lot of uh, uh, saving in\n",
      "and I also have got a checking account besides that,\n",
      "but, what I do on my money market account, my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month. I will just take two hundred and twenty out\n",
      "and I put it in parenthesis.\n",
      "I take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it.\n",
      "Then when the tax bill comes in I've got that much set aside.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And I guess that's a way of budgeting.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's,\n",
      "I guess I kind of do a similar thing. More, uh, medium or longer range.\n",
      "I just have a maybe a targeted amount that I will save for.\n",
      "Like I am,\n",
      "probably within a year I would like to buy a new car.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, I kind of have a, an amount in my mind\n",
      "and I am making every effort to, to put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget. Not only for buying them, but for keeping them on the road too.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh, you know, we've got two cars.\n",
      "My wife has a car\n",
      "and I like to drive pick up truck.\n",
      "So, we are on a schedule where I try every, uh, three or four years to, to buy a new one.\n",
      "And you know I am constantly making car payments,\n",
      "but I figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway, is making car payments.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, uh, you know, I get one paid for\n",
      "and, uh, actually I am saving up for another one besides\n",
      "so it's you know, it's kind of a never ending thing,\n",
      "Huh. Right.\n",
      "but you try to, you try to schedule those things so that, uh, you only, you're not paying for two of at the same time I guess is what I am saying.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Have you thought about, uh, leasing?\n",
      "Well, uh, I have thought about it,\n",
      "but leasing wouldn't,\n",
      "you know, I don't use it for my business.\n",
      "I see.\n",
      "My wife uses hers just for pleasure\n",
      "and I use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "so.\n",
      "But if you are rolling it over every three years, it might be advantageous to do that.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I guess.\n",
      "Uh,\n",
      "You know, typically, you, if you purchase your own car you tend to make, uh, the best returns after you pay it off.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Of course, the longer you keep it beyond that point, the more profitable it is to own it yourself.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "you're right.\n",
      "Uh, I have, uh, been know to keep trucks or cars for oh, ten or twelve years,\n",
      "but I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill\n",
      "and you got to put put stuff in them you know.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "mine's, uh, seven years old\n",
      "and I think last year was, that was a rough year for it.\n",
      "I had a number of expenses\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, uh, I am hoping that most of them were just kind of,\n",
      "uh, you know the,\n",
      "as you get to a certain number of miles, you have to get everything replaced, brakes, shocks and all that.\n",
      "So, I just went through that whole set last year.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again\n",
      "Those things can really upset your budget when they, when they come in.\n",
      "Uh, you know, it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the, for the unexpected shall we say. So that it doesn't, uh, kill you all in one month.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "What line of work are you in?\n",
      "Your turn.\n",
      "Oh, I, I start.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, uh, we keep a budget to an extent.\n",
      "Uh, and really, we were really forced into keeping a budget because I'm, I'm paid once a month which sort of, sort of forces some, uh, uh, restrictions\n",
      "and you need to make sure all your bills are paid.\n",
      "Uh, about yourself?\n",
      "Well, I have to say I really don't have a budget.\n",
      "Both my wife and I, uh, grew up in, uh, families of rather modest means\n",
      "and, uh, our family income, at this point, is comfortable. Upper middle class I guess you might say.\n",
      "And, uh, we're both so, uh, frugal that, uh, we really don't need a budget, you know.\n",
      "We just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which I guess is a comfortable thing.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well I guess that really is sort of, uh, keeping a budget,\n",
      "you know. You stay within your, uh  within your means.\n",
      "Well we stay within our means\n",
      "but we  don't do it, uh, by conscious effort.\n",
      "It just sort of happens automatically.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Although we just moved to California\n",
      "and, uh, the cost of living here in California is, uh, I would say rather pathological\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Uh, housing prices are, you know, like from four to ten times more expensive than, uh, uh, they were where I came from in, uh, Dallas.\n",
      "Oh, you moved from Dallas to San Francisco.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, uh uh, that presents a, a real shock\n",
      "That is a hugh difference.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California\n",
      "but,\n",
      "But you have good sour dough\n",
      "and it's a beautiful place to live\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's God's country.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, and one way you know that is that only God can afford it\n",
      "Uh, so budget is not a problem for us.\n",
      "Uh, at least it hasn't been.\n",
      "It may, may be at this point.\n",
      "But, uh, up until this point it really hasn't been\n",
      "When I, uh, was in, uh, undergraduate school a long, long time ago, I, uh, noted that the monthly salary, starting average monthly salary salary for engineers that, you know, in my discipline, was like oh, six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that.\n",
      "And, uh, I noted at that point that I was, you know, if that's what my salary was that I drew then I would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever.\n",
      "So I stopped worrying about money.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And it,\n",
      "never have worried about money since then.\n",
      "Well, that, that's a system too.\n",
      "Sometimes, uh, it's a bit of a, a problem, you know, because I guess I don't really manage my money the way I should.\n",
      "But, uh, I suppose I've lost money on not taking good advantage of, of, uh, investments\n",
      "but,\n",
      "Well then again, you know, you said you, you are able to take trips.\n",
      "And you do, obviously, have enough to live on\n",
      "so I guess you're indirectly budgeting. Uh, just bye-bye the fact that you said you're both very frugal, uh, in spending the money.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, I mean that's, that's a form of budgeting I would think\n",
      "It's, it's kind of a strange topic to, to try to, for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money.\n",
      "Well, I guess we're both lucky in that regard then.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "How big is your family?\n",
      "Uh, well we're, we have one on the way.\n",
      "I see.\n",
      "Uh, my wife,\n",
      "and then, we're, we're having one on the way in, uh, in, uh, September.\n",
      "So how,\n",
      "you, once you get ten children though, you may have,\n",
      "No\n",
      "I think it's just going to be one.\n",
      "Oh, all right\n",
      "How about yourself?\n",
      "I have two kids.\n",
      "Uh, one  nine and one thirteen\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "and they are beginning to be a budget problem but, uh, have not been really up until this, up to this point.\n",
      "Do they budget at all?\n",
      "I mean do you have them on an allowance?\n",
      "I give them a, I give them an allowance\n",
      "and they, uh,\n",
      "I basically give my son ten dollars a week\n",
      "and I put half of it in the bank\n",
      "and I give, give him the other half in cold cash.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, uh, he has a teller card so he can, uh, do what he do what he wishes with the money that I put in the bank.\n",
      "But, at least, it isn't, you know, burning a hole in his pocket.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "If he wants to use it, he has to go get it\n",
      "and that usually\n",
      "Capital punishment, uh, I guess, out in California is, has had a lot of, uh, a lot of, you know, discourse in the paper.\n",
      "Uh, apparently, you know, there's, they haven't, uh, executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven, I believe.\n",
      "Uh, yeah.\n",
      "That's, that's as far back as I can remember\n",
      "Well, that's before  my time actually.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they,\n",
      "Well, I, we were, we, uh, we just started, we lived in Redwood City when we were out there.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, and we found that, uh you know, it was a very liberal kind of community.\n",
      "But the, uh, I, I really feel that, that the law enforcement community, uh, you know, puts these people behind bars\n",
      "and then they, they, uh, uh, you know, lawyers, these lawyer groups get together\n",
      "and they, uh, they, I think, extend beyond the normal, uh, appeal process. Uh, you know, and just drag these, this guy, uh, his, his, uh, ultimate, uh, demise out for ten or fifteen years.\n",
      "Uh, and I, I think that, uh, that there's something that has to be changed in the system to, to do that.\n",
      "I think capital punishment, uh, uh, was or probably stringent enough\n",
      "but I think the appeal process is really getting in the way.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Do, do you feel as though there should be, uh, more, uh, was or, or more, uh, you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by, uh, by, uh, uh, capital punishment?\n",
      "Well I think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not,\n",
      "it's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself.\n",
      "It's at that point where they're saying like here you're, you're going on death row\n",
      "but you'll stay there for twenty years.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And nothing is being done about it.\n",
      "Uh, the laws exist and are frequently upheld in, in, uh, in Appeals Court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find.\n",
      "And it's, it's really getting out of hand in many states.\n",
      "Well, the term technicality .\n",
      "The law enforcement community, uh, uh, you know, has to, has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which, uh, grievous acts are done to, uh, to, you know, to get somebody into a, a situation where they're going to be guilty of, of a crime.\n",
      "Or whether, uh, and whether the rights of that individual are been, have been, you know, impuned.\n",
      "Uh, but or whether there's just, you know, a policeman has just made a, uh, a, you know, a non, a noncritical error, though be it not the right way to do it\n",
      "but, but, you know, the, the merits of the case in terms of, you know, the guy was a law breaker, as being supportive.\n",
      "Now, I, I'm, at this juncture\n",
      "I, you know, I'm, I'm not sure, you know, what constitutes a, a technicality.\n",
      "You know, that, that's what all these, these hearings are about\n",
      "and that's what all these, you know, court cases are about.\n",
      "I mean our, uh, our, our glorious, uh, you know, mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of, out of the can\n",
      "and, uh, you know, he, he tried to appeal his conviction. Uh,\n",
      "and, you know, it didn't work.\n",
      "But be that as it may, everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry.\n",
      "Uh, in, in the old days, you know, and say round about times of battle of Hastings, you know, and the villages if you were a transgressor, they, they either, you know, drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody\n",
      "and he, you were his slave.\n",
      "And if he didn't like what you did, he killed you.\n",
      "And that has, that's pretty effective.\n",
      "Uh, you know, it's not good for civil rights, I guess,\n",
      "but it's pretty effective in that, you know, you've got to get along in the community\n",
      "and if you don't you'll perish. Either by the hand of your, your, your master or by being pushed out in the woods.\n",
      "So, I, I, I mean as, as man has gotten more complicated so all of the, uh, imaginations to, uh, you know, protect him from, from being, uh, dumped on by, uh, civilian authority in, in in criminal actions, especially, you know, murder cases and that sort of thing.\n",
      "Well, it seems like well it, it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished,\n",
      "and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didn't the crimes, albeit it seems that we are failing in that, in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off.\n",
      "Um, for instance, um there's a case a few years back where, uh, someone, uh, someone who's being convicted for, was under a was going to trial for murder, was let off because of a technicality in that. The the arresting officer, uh, did not read the defendant their rights.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And where his, old evidence was there, the witnesses were there, the, everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet\n",
      "Uh, a lot of companies now are, are using, uh, drug testing paraphernalia and drug testing situations to, to root out the, the either, uh, elementary or intermediate or advanced, uh, drug users.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, I know the, the government is, uh, you know, gives drug tests to all new entrants, all new applicants coming into government.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, and I quite frankly, don't see anything wrong with it.\n",
      "I, I'm, I guess I'm not a good civil libertarian.\n",
      "And, and I, I feel as though, uh, that, uh, uh, you know, that if you, you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background.\n",
      "Of course, we're, we're,\n",
      "being involved in my organization, uh, we, we have deep background checks\n",
      "and  and so, uh, but, but, sometimes, you know, drug use can, can escape that.\n",
      "Sure,\n",
      "sure.\n",
      "And, uh, I have absolutely no compunction about, uh, using any and all means to, to, uh, uh, you know, work out, figure out who has a drug program or who has a drug problem and, uh, and putting that guy into, into therapy to, whatever it is to, to, you know, break this, uh, activity.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Of course, if he's fallen in love with drugs\n",
      "and there isn't anything\n",
      "but getting stoned or high is, is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful, then maybe there is no hope\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "What's your, uh, feeling?\n",
      "Uh, well I guess I, I guess I'm probably a little more to, toward the other direction.\n",
      "Uh, well I guess, mainly because, uh, it's, I, well,\n",
      "like there's two sides to it I guess.\n",
      "Uh, one is that, uh, if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug, alcohol, whatever, or, you know, even if it's smoking, inhibits, you know, your ability to function, then I, I think that, that, you know, I don't have any problem at all with testing that individual, you know, on the spot.\n",
      "Uh, but I guess I feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business.\n",
      "Uh, and I guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that, uh, things like drug laws seem to come and go.\n",
      "You know, we had prohibition for awhile\n",
      "and then we didn't have prohibition.\n",
      "Uh, you know, we've had, I guess, laws against, uh, you know, various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years, I guess.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Maybe a little longer.\n",
      "Well I think, uh, the the laws on, uh, uh, uh, the first morphine laws were, were like ninety, or nineteen ten or nineteen five, something like that.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, eighty years or so.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, so I,\n",
      "you know, it's, it's hard to, I guess, for me to justify what seems like, you know, basically a breach of the First you know, freedom from, uh, search and seizure, you know, uh, on something that may or may not stand as a law, you know, fifty years from now or even twenty or ten,\n",
      "who knows.\n",
      "Well, the thing of it is the, the,  that, that is, uh, uh, in, in many respects, uh, uh, you know, just, just, I think, an over simplification.\n",
      "I mean, prohibition certainly didn't last.\n",
      "I, I think there, there's so much criminal activity, uh, that people go into to, to support drug habits.\n",
      "Well, but you got to look at prohibition though.\n",
      "You had the same problems there, right?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You know, they, they support drug habits with, uh, with, uh, you know, with things like, uh, you know, burglary or, or prostitution or stuff like that,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Well it goes back to that, again,\n",
      "if you look at prohibition. I mean because it's illegal, it costs more.\n",
      "If it was legal,\n",
      "I mean, face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what, ten or twenty dollars an ounce.\n",
      "I, I I must admit that,\n",
      "And clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is, you know, snort your brains out all day long, if it was legal, you could do it real cheap\n",
      "and, you know, you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But, yeah,\n",
      "get, uh,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I, I must admit that the production costs of, of these drugs are, are zippo compared to the street market costs and, and the costs to society,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "well that's why there's, you know, people dealing it because there's money in it, you know.\n",
      "There's ridiculous amounts of money.\n",
      "But I, I, I, I think that, that the, that, you know, the, being in law enforcement, you know, they, I, I probably have a kind of a draconian, Philistine attitude toward it.\n",
      "And, but, but the, uh, uh, I, I really feel as though the interdiction effort is, is,\n",
      "as soon as you, you get rid of one goon that's, that's, that's involved in drugs and\n",
      "Oh yeah,\n",
      "interdiction's hopeless.\n",
      "I mean\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and then another, another one will jump up.\n",
      "there's no way you're ever going to win that.\n",
      "But we, we see,\n",
      "The tighter you squeeze, the more the price goes up, the more incentive there is.\n",
      "I mean that's a losing fight .\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "as soon as we wind up, uh, uh, you know, for,\n",
      "well if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand\n",
      "but, but people  want to, get, get stoned\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "and I, I don't see that,\n",
      "Well, yeah.\n",
      "It goes back to, you know, what right, what can society impose on people.\n",
      "I mean, can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I don't think you can.\n",
      "I mean, you know, I'm, you know, was raised with being a very strong Bible work ethic\n",
      "so, you know, I'm one of these, you know, ten, twelve, fifteen, twenty hour a day type people.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, you know, yeah,\n",
      "I can really relate to\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "everybody ought to do their own share,\n",
      "you know. I don't have any, you know, love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, you know,\n",
      "See, when you're with a big company or a big organization, a lot of times, uh, you know, the benefits are good\n",
      "and, and, you know, the pay is regular\n",
      "but, uh, you know, sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on.\n",
      "And I, I think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that, that, uh, that anybody could get in, in dealing with a large company is to be in a situation where you, you get to know what's going on.\n",
      "And maybe that's, that's probably the toughest thing in the whole world to, to do.\n",
      "What's, what's your feeling about benefits?\n",
      "What sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company.\n",
      "Well, since I'm kind of on the, the older side, you know, I, I, I just feel like, uh, when I start talking about benefits, I talk about, I'm concerned about medical benefits\n",
      "Uh, my, uh, my husband works for McDonald Douglas\n",
      "and so his benefits, his medical benefits are so excellent, you know,\n",
      "that's really great.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "You know, I work for, uh, a bank, Western Financial.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, they don't let me know really about anything that's going on.\n",
      "Even some of the immediate things that I need to know, I don't know it until the next hour\n",
      "and all of a sudden we know we've got changes made.\n",
      "We're changing departments.\n",
      "We're changing policies.\n",
      "We're changing doing other kinds of things. Which to me is, is disturbing\n",
      "I mean, I feel like if, I, I don't necessarily need to, uh, be involved since I'm pretty much on a low level,\n",
      "you are, you are right there.\n",
      "You know, I'm pretty much on a low level as far as, uh, the company is concerned.\n",
      "But I, I do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening\n",
      "and I think I can be a better and more effective employee if, if I  had a little bit more information along that line.\n",
      "Well,\n",
      "I   I well I work for the government\n",
      "and, uh, actually I work for the F B I.\n",
      "Oh, my gosh.\n",
      "And, uh, and so, you know, we, we don't, there's lots of things that we don't get told. For good reason.\n",
      "But, uh, but basically, uh, there's lots of things that, that we should know about projects.\n",
      "I'm an engineer. You know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I'm, I'm a COTR.\n",
      "And\n",
      "and I, I worked in the same lab with a guy\n",
      "and we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years.\n",
      "And we should have,\n",
      "you know, we're, we're now collaborating.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And\n",
      "And it, it ,\n",
      "for two years we didn't. And, we, which was a, kind of stupid.\n",
      "But, uh, but our organization is doing something else on Monday.\n",
      "Uh, we're having a, for all unclassified programs, we're, we're having little tables put up in front of lab in the hallways\n",
      "and every, all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do. Which I thought was kind of interesting and, But, uh, but that, that sort, sort of thing.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that is interesting.\n",
      "But, if you, I think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "And, and, but of course most time, most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know.\n",
      "And, you know, if you don't really count. If you're not part of the program you might not get told for months.\n",
      "Or you might, you know, if it doesn't impact you directly. Or if your management doesn't think that.\n",
      "But, but regard to benefits. You know, most companies have, most big organizations have decent, you know, benefits like retirement and that sort of thing.\n",
      "In the private sector I would think that one of the major, uh, situations, especially when you reach, you know, the, the mid-fifties, is keeping a job until you retire.\n",
      "right.\n",
      "And engineers are, uh, are baggage to most, uh, uh, as they get older, to, to most companies.\n",
      "And, uh, it's very much like the military,\n",
      "it windows out.\n",
      "You know, you, you think well, boy, I'm getting more money\n",
      "and I'm getting more responsibility,\n",
      "I'm doing this.\n",
      "But as you climb up that tree, pretty soon you're, the, the branches get smaller on the top of the tree\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and pretty soon somebody falls off.\n",
      "I, I've fallen off twice in the private sector.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And, uh, and, you know, I can get up,\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "It, it seems to be, be kind of, kind of scary, you know. Because you think of,\n",
      "uh, see my son's eighteen right now\n",
      "and he, he's, uh, he wants to go into engineering.\n",
      "And the, the, the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open\n",
      "and he's interested in, basically, three different areas.\n",
      "But, uh, it's difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that.\n",
      "He needs to do his own course of investigation and, and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And in thirty years it becomes pretty critical.\n",
      "I mean, my, uh, brother-in-law is like, uh, I mean he's sixty.\n",
      "He's not ready to retire\n",
      "but his company is, is, uh, is, uh, closing up.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff. And all the nuclear and stuff which is what he, what he was working on. He's getting cut back\n",
      "and he's not ready to retire\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "he may be retired.\n",
      "Budgeting activity in our household I, has is, uh, uh, kind of an informal kind of situation.\n",
      "We, we, you know, put,\n",
      "actually what happens is, uh, is, my check gets automatically deposited.\n",
      "I don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore.\n",
      "It just gets deposited.\n",
      "And,  and, and my, my wife, you know, you know, looks at all those bills that come in\n",
      "and, you know, and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them. You see,\n",
      "and so our, our budgeting,\n",
      "we really don't have a formal budgeting situation.\n",
      "Every time I've ever tried one, it's, uh, I've just got wrapped in my inertia.\n",
      "And, uh, I've just decided not to pursue it.\n",
      "Uh, what, what's your budget situation?\n",
      "Well, actually, uh, I've, I've had a couple of different situations.\n",
      "My current one has been the most successful.\n",
      "Uh, at a certain point in life\n",
      "my husband, my ex-husband was an alcoholic.\n",
      "And we got divorced back in the mid-seventies\n",
      "and that left me with three teenagers.\n",
      "You know, well actually that kind of situation is just wonderful for budgets. Isn't it?\n",
      "It certainly is\n",
      "But at any rate, what happened was that I, I just absolutely put away all the credit cards.\n",
      "I didn't rip them up.\n",
      "I didn't send them back.\n",
      "Nothing.\n",
      "I just put them away.\n",
      "Because there was one that it was really handy to have.\n",
      "If I absolutely had to have something, I could go use it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, uh, mostly we just spent cash. Whatever we had.\n",
      "And if we didn't have it, we absolutely didn't spend it.\n",
      "But then, as things improved, you know.\n",
      "Once, once I got them all through college, uh, it came to the point where, uh,\n",
      "my parents came through the depression.\n",
      "I'm not sure how old you are.\n",
      "Well, my, you know, my, my parents too.\n",
      "You, you  you were born in, in the, in the late thirties or early forties.\n",
      "But my,\n",
      "Late thirties,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, uh, my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house.\n",
      "And that's kind of the way I was raised.\n",
      "And so I'm not a very demanding person in, in that aspect.\n",
      "So for quite a period of time, I just flat didn't spend any money.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Now, meanwhile, I got, had a, a building bank balance.\n",
      "And my intent was that whenever something went on sale that I really had to have, I would have the cash to buy it right then and there. And not ever have to spend any money on interest.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, that, that's good.\n",
      "And that, that's the way I've operated ever since then.\n",
      "It,\n",
      "and you know, if, if something goes on sale and I don't have the money, I still don't buy it.\n",
      "Well, we, we buy what, well,\n",
      "we just got through buying a twenty-five foot refrigerator, a new ceramic top stove, and a new dishwasher.\n",
      "Oh my\n",
      "And, and we put twenty-eight hundred dollars on the charge. Along with my trip to Japan which was, was fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars\n",
      "Oh my!\n",
      "and you know.\n",
      "Oh my.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I mean, we just, we got a monster, you know, bill coming in.\n",
      "But, but we also have zero interest being paid.\n",
      "And we pay it off as, as it goes.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And that's the way I do my credit cards now.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So we never really get that much over, uh, over extended.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I do almost all my purchasing on credit cards.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "But it's the fact that I have enough of a, of a cushion in the bank so that when they come, I can pay them in full.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We're, we're doing that.\n",
      "We have, you know, uh,\n",
      "this is our, our, our big, uh,\n",
      "we did redecorating.\n",
      "Two, you know, two new pieces in the in the family room and new carpet.\n",
      "I mean we just  uh, we've just been spending, spending, spending.\n",
      "Oh my.\n",
      "I'm envious\n",
      "Well I,\n",
      "but we haven't really done anything for a long time because we've, we've had two kids in college that just have graduated in the past year.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So we're, you know, we don't have that.\n",
      "It's time for you to do these things then. Right?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's, uh, it's about time that we did that.\n",
      "and it all looks still pretty good to me.\n",
      "Why, why we need to replace it?\n",
      "But, but, unfortunately my, my, my wife really feels as though it's, it's just been an inappropriate, uh, thing to, to, I mean\n",
      "that rug is thirteen years old,\n",
      "why not replace it.\n",
      "I mean, uh, I say it might go for another thirteen\n",
      "but, uh, too late, we'll never find that out.\n",
      "This is so funny.\n",
      "That's wonderful.\n",
      "But  you're lucky to have her because if you're like me and you have difficulty spending money, you need somebody to help you spend it.\n",
      "And,\n",
      "I mean, certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should, be or not\n",
      "You know, I, I, I don't spend that much money.\n",
      "I just, uh, we just sort of have had, uh, you know, too many obligations to, you know,\n",
      "we sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they, they got through school.\n",
      "And that was the major, you know, decade of expenses, you know.\n",
      "So we, we feel as, uh,\n",
      "but as far as any formal budgeting, uh, you know, I, I, we just apparently have been very fortunate.\n",
      "When we went, want to go out to eat, we go out to eat.\n",
      "We never really, you know, have to program money for that or make choices, you know.\n",
      "But, uh, we don't have that uproarious a, a lifestyle.\n",
      "After all, we're,\n",
      "Okay, um.\n",
      "How has it been this week for you?\n",
      "Weather-wise, or otherwise?\n",
      "Weather-wise.\n",
      "Weather-wise.\n",
      "Damp, cold, warm\n",
      "Oh, no,\n",
      "damp.\n",
      "We have, we have gone through, what might be called the four seasons, uh, in the last week.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "We have had highs of seventy-two, lows in the twenties.\n",
      "My goodness.\n",
      "Well, I don't even want to tell you what ours has been like then.\n",
      "It was ninety-six yesterday,\n",
      "I heard about that.\n",
      "and we set a record yesterday. And, uh, very windy,\n",
      "but then today the wind has dropped off, and also, the temperature, so, very cool, uh,\n",
      "I think right now it's like sixty-nine,\n",
      "Um\n",
      "and that's cool for\n",
      "or it feels cool compared to yesterday, but very pleasant,\n",
      "no rain in the last month, I don't think.\n",
      "The ground's very dry\n",
      "and our yard work, everything is in bloom,\n",
      "so our yard work is pretty tough, the ground being dry,\n",
      "but I guess it also, uh, brings about allergies,\n",
      "we're having a lot of allergies down here right now.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Everything blooming,\n",
      "and, and the weather.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, I think a lot of people have contracted, uh, spring fever too,\n",
      "so. Had a lot of people out at work, you know, for fishing, and, and uh, and golfing, reasons and things like that.\n",
      "The blue flu,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "the blue flu, or the white collar flu, depending on where you work, I guess.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Oh, we have had, uh, as I've said, we have had variable weather. Uh,\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "It has been untypically wet for this time of year,\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "and, also, we have a lot of green, you know,\n",
      "the grass has been growing\n",
      "and if you look outside, you would like to go out and mow your lawn, if you could go out and buy a new spark plug, or something along those lines,\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "but fortunately it rains\n",
      "and you, uh, do not have to go out and buy the spark plug, you know.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But, we've had an unusually, uh, uh, warm spring,\n",
      "and, well I guess we're still in winter,\n",
      "and, uh, we have had no snow.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "No snow?\n",
      "To speak of, to speak of.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "We usually average, oh, anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter\n",
      "and this year, as well as last year, we have had less than four inches total accumulation.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "So, it's been inordinately warm, uh, here, for, uh, for this time of year.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "So, uh, in that regard, it's fine,\n",
      "but, uh, I envy you your ninety-four degrees.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "yes\n",
      "it is.\n",
      "Down in the more southern and western areas.\n",
      "And, of course we are, um, about two hours from the northern border, straight south,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and, and, uh, very windy.\n",
      "It's amazing to me\n",
      "because I have only lived in Dallas for three years,\n",
      "and I cannot believe that the wind blows all the time.\n",
      "It does,\n",
      "I, I\n",
      "very seldom, if any,\n",
      "I can't remember, you know, a day that I walked out and the wind wasn't blowing.\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "Well, I spent six years in graduate school at, in Indiana. In the flatlands,\n",
      "and it was that way every day.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour. Summer and winter,\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "so, that, uh,\n",
      "you, you became accustomed to it, I guess.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, uh, otherwise as I said, we have had, uh, a relatively mild winter, speaking for this area of the country.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, where did you go to school in Indiana?\n",
      "Purdue.\n",
      "Purdue.\n",
      "I have a brother that lives in, uh, uh, South Bend, Indiana.\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "And, I had to always,\n",
      "I've lived there for eight years myself.\n",
      "I'd always said I was going to go back to school and go to Notre Dame.\n",
      "But, I didn't. Uh.\n",
      "Well, you are not from that area originally, I can tell.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "originally I'm from New Mexico.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "I was born in New Mexico\n",
      "and we lived in, uh, South Bend for eighty, eight years, and, uh, then moved to, uh, Tennessee actually.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh,\n",
      "Well, I thought I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere.\n",
      "Very much,\n",
      "very much,\n",
      "cause I, I spent thirteen years there. And, uh, then moved to Dallas about three years ago.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "Gee,\n",
      "you've moved almost, moved around as much as I have\n",
      "Yeah, uh,\n",
      "my father was in the Air Force,\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Oh, I see.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, I worked for the government,\n",
      "so I, I moved, uh, much more frequently than I had intended for sixteen years,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, uh, I guess the, uh, this is my first conversation in this, uh, uh, series.\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "I, I received a call last night because of the, uh,\n",
      "I had not received my, uh, personal identification number.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, I had to call Jack Godfrey today to ask him what it was, because I, I had to abort the call last evening because I couldn't get on the line.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "So, uh, is there any,\n",
      "I'm not sure how long we're supposed to talk.\n",
      "It's, um, it's just as long as you want to.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "I mean it's just, uh, as long as you want to, and just, you know, a reasonable lengthy conversation.\n",
      "Uh, do you work for Texas Instruments?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I do not.\n",
      "I work for G T E.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "And, I, uh, of course, was, I was sent a, uh, an application from, uh, from Jack.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I've known Jack for some time.\n",
      "I'm in the speech processing business, and have been for a number of years,\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "so I was very much interested, in, in being a speaker for this\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, actually, I, I work for Texas Instruments,\n",
      "and, uh, I'm an a, I'm an environmental engineer,\n",
      "Oh, I see.\n",
      "and, uh, they just published this internally, you know, getting people involved.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, that, that's really strange.\n",
      "I, I was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though.\n",
      "I was saying, God, do we have a TI in Maryland\n",
      "or,\n",
      "I'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area. If just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, um, but I have, uh, I have been a speaker in other, uh, similar type of activities.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, I know the reason why this is, why the, uh, this is being gathered and the program and so forth,\n",
      "so, I was interested as I said, I was interested in being a speaker.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "We haven't talked much about the weather\n",
      "Oh, well.\n",
      "I know that's what we're supposed to do.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Well, really it, uh, the letter just says, um,\n",
      "let's see, I can't,\n",
      "I was looking at it,\n",
      "I was trying to find out speedy short cuts,\n",
      "and I always thought it's not necessary to measure your time, just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation, and, and, end it when needed.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "In environmental engineering, uh,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "is that with regard to work place engineering, or just, you know, the work place environment\n",
      "or,\n",
      "Uh, well, it's actually, um, waste water.\n",
      "Oh, I see.\n",
      "Taking, taking care of uh,\n",
      "I'm actually in the air division,\n",
      "and we monitor, um, anything that comes out of a stack, or out of a building,\n",
      "or, um, we do have customers that, um, their concerns are in the work place\n",
      "and we take care of that,\n",
      "but , within our department. We take care of everything. Waste water, uh, solid waste, and recycling, and, and air and\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, I had\n",
      "my, the, the call last evening was supposed to be about, uh, concerning recycling in the community.\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "The call I received,\n",
      "and so, I had, uh, I had thought a little bit about it, um, before hand.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "So, I,\n",
      "but that, that's interesting.\n",
      "I have a, uh, uh, friend who is a planner. Uh, a city planner.\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "And, one of his,\n",
      "and he models, uh, city districts, and so forth, uh, does computer modeling.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, one of the, uh,\n",
      "he has inputs, or gets inputs from, uh, an environmental engineer. .\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we actually, our division is corporate wide,\n",
      "and we take care of just the Dallas area.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Of course we have several plants here,\n",
      "but, um, we do air modeling also.\n",
      "Oh, I see.\n",
      "And, and, yeah, I take care of all the air modeling, specifically for the Dallas area.\n",
      "What we do, we have a weather station, that we get all of this information, you know, temperature, wind speed, wind direction,\n",
      "and, uh, we have a huge chemical data base.\n",
      "Well, that's interesting.\n",
      "And, uh, our, our chemical data base, so that we know every chemical on site\n",
      "and, and, um, its concentration,\n",
      "and if, if anything ever happened, God forbid, you know, a building explosion or something we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station.\n",
      "Okay, um, well,\n",
      "just a couple.\n",
      "What do you have\n",
      "Uh, I've got an Omega\n",
      "and I've got a, uh, generic three eighty, or four eighty-six machine.\n",
      "Oh, yeah?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's very, very generic.\n",
      "What did you do, put it together?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and, and, uh, upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled\n",
      "and now, now it's, now it's a fast machine\n",
      "Well, that's,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's all I got to say for it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "What do you use it for?\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "What do you use it for?\n",
      "Uh, work,\n",
      "uh, I'm a contract programmer.\n",
      "Oh, yeah?\n",
      "What kind of programs do you,\n",
      "Uh, anything\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "I mean like business programs\n",
      "or, Man.\n",
      "Uh, I've done business programming, you know, scientific applications like, you know, petroleum science stuff and, Uh, uh, test equipment\n",
      "and I did the, I, I did one that was, the demonstration of a touch, touch screen for a company that sells, uh, touch screens.\n",
      "It was kind of fun.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "Put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display. And make it look like things like, uh, you know, attack simulators and , and all sorts of little things you'd want to put your finger on the screen for.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Well, that's,\n",
      "Well, that sounds interesting.\n",
      "Matter of fact, uh, I guess you do, uh, you get a lot of graphics in there, I imagine, huh.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "definitely.\n",
      "That's where the speed helps out.\n",
      "Uh, yeah,\n",
      "unfortunately the little portable P C that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz, eighty, eighty-six.\n",
      "It's like slow out the\n",
      "Yep,\n",
      "that will, that will, slow you up\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "Well, I, I do, uh, uh, programming for C N C turret presses and uh, cat cam system type things\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, really need a faster system.\n",
      "Uh, I got a new line that I, I sell metal fabricating equipment, and cat cam systems, and tooling, et cetera.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh,\n",
      "I know a guy that upgrades, uh, for a reasonable cost.\n",
      "Who is that?\n",
      "Uh, his name is T Q or something like that.\n",
      "And my notebook is somewhere around here\n",
      "See if I can make my telephone cord stretch far enough.\n",
      "I've tried to do is get this outfit to give me one\n",
      "Uh, he's, uh, up in,\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "That's how I got my other ones by selling their product for them.\n",
      "They not only give me a demonstrator, but the hardware as well as the software.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And as they, And as they go to the next one I just keep the,\n",
      "Oh, that works.\n",
      "that's why I have so many different levels of P C around at the moment.\n",
      "Uh, here it is.\n",
      "A T S Computers.\n",
      "A T S?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And where are they at?\n",
      "Uh, do you know where, uh, Custer is?\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "he's, uh, uh, south of Renner on, on Custer.\n",
      "And there is a little bitty mall that looks kind of like, or, strip kind of center.\n",
      "In Richardson there.\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "In Richardson?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I know where you mean.\n",
      "There is a Mobil and all that kind of uh, on that one corner,\n",
      "that's about Lookout there, I think, isn't it.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "it's, it's, it's just south of there.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's a little place, looks like a castle.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Kind of, uh, little guy in there.\n",
      "He, he, uh, gives reasonable prices.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Like I, I traded my, uh, three eighty-six for the four eighty-six for about six hundred.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Well, that's a good deal.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it was pretty reasonable.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But, uh, uh, he,\n",
      "and he does a good job\n",
      "and he, he, he, uh, guarantees everything he sells.\n",
      "Uh, there is a lot,\n",
      "you ever go by Lucky Computer there?\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "I used to,\n",
      "when I was putting shop floor computers together for guys, I'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so.\n",
      "So I, I don't know where those guys are at these days.\n",
      "But I, ,\n",
      "Uh, they, they're up there in that mall. Uh, just below Campbell. Or that strip, strip, center.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "They're still doing business. Big business, apparently.\n",
      "I tell you, those prices have just, unbelievably come down.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "oh, yeah,\n",
      "I was amazed I was able to get this four eighty-six for six hundred even with a trade in,\n",
      "you know, it's like, wow\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That works,\n",
      "I'll go do that\n",
      "I,\n",
      "And boy that thing screams now.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed, the three eighty-six.\n",
      "That wasn't alive for but maybe two years.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, I thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eighty-six S X even though the, the price difference is about ten dollars.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "That's it?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it, when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks.\n",
      "I'll be darned.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Huh, well,\n",
      "you've done.\n",
      "Our most recent series of projects I guess, was, inside was, uh, we remodeled a bathroom recently.\n",
      "Well, how did it go?\n",
      "Well, it went pretty well, uh, other than the fact that we encountered some, uh, problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing, which one thing led to another,\n",
      "and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain.  Which meant you needed to take the wall out and start all over.\n",
      "Gee, like starting over, I guess.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "It wasn't one of those,\n",
      "it started out as a Sunday project\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "and by, by the next Sunday it was done.\n",
      "It wasn't a one dayer.\n",
      "Believe me.\n",
      "Boy, that sounds like, uh,\n",
      "course, uh, I don't know,\n",
      "once you get it done, then you probably won't have that problem again.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's good for another thirty years.\n",
      "Um, you've got an older house?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "They are built a little bit more sturdy than\n",
      "Well, that's the thing that surprised me, because once I got into the plumbing everything in there was copper,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and it was all soldered.\n",
      "Oh, is that right.\n",
      "That's what drove me bananas, because, you know, I'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and and cement to fit them together\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "and nothing wanted to go,\n",
      "so it was like I had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over.\n",
      "And just start at square one.\n",
      "Really.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "That was an all day job, just to get it plumbed.\n",
      "Well, and then if you do it wrong\n",
      "Fortunately, I was very fortunate, uh, in the fact that, uh, when I made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on  nothing leaked,\n",
      "Everything went all right.\n",
      "everything worked.\n",
      "And I just said, that's marvelous.\n",
      "I appreciate it.\n",
      "That's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happens.\n",
      "Well, I expected something to leak, you know left a fitting loose, or didn't use teflon tape on one of them or something like that.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "But it all came together,\n",
      "so I, I felt pretty fortunate about that.\n",
      "All worked out all right, huh.\n",
      "How about you?\n",
      "Well, um, well probably the last thing I did was, uh, paint and wallpaper kids room\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, I learned to,\n",
      "I used the wrong kind of paint.\n",
      "This wasn't, must have not been a very good quality, because it just hasn't stood up very well.\n",
      "What kind of paint?\n",
      "It was a latex paint, paint,\n",
      "it was flat\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I wonder if maybe I should have used a gloss.\n",
      "Uh, but they say you ought to use your gloss mainly in your kitchens, and things like that.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that, and semigloss for trim work, and usually flat for walls.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but I think maybe, uh,\n",
      "I don't know if it was just the.\n",
      "Was it not washable paint?\n",
      "Well, it, it is a latex paint,\n",
      "but it just kind of is, is,\n",
      "so, you know, so it's supposed to wash, you're supposed to be able to wash it\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but it, um, just looks dingy.\n",
      "I don't know how else to explain it.\n",
      "What color is it?\n",
      "It's pink.\n",
      "Pink,\n",
      "okay.\n",
      "It's kind of got, uh, oh, just kind of a worn look to it.\n",
      "I don't know even how to say,\n",
      "just didn't turn out quite as nice as I would have liked\n",
      "but,\n",
      "Did you, uh, require more than one can of paint?\n",
      "I, we put two coats on it,\n",
      "and it's a small room,\n",
      "but I think it only took one, uh, can.\n",
      "You didn't have to mix paint then, right.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "We did, uh, oh,\n",
      "you do mix the color as far as you start with, uh, white\n",
      "and then they add the color.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You know what I'm saying\n",
      "but,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But you only had one can of paint that you did the entire room with.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And then I wall papered a couple of walls,\n",
      "and, uh.\n",
      "How'd that go?\n",
      "Well, that was the first time I've ever wallpapered,\n",
      "and, uh,\n",
      "Kind of fun, isn't it.\n",
      "That's an education in itself.\n",
      "Really.\n",
      "But, uh, the dye lots, uh, must have been a little bit different from,\n",
      "first of all it takes quite a few rolls, even a small room, if you're trying to match a design.\n",
      "Repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you, when you buy your paper.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "That's what I needed,\n",
      "and I didn't think about that.\n",
      "I got a Mickey Mouse print is what I got.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And so a lot is wasted.\n",
      "Normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats.\n",
      "So you know how.\n",
      "See, I didn't even think to look for that.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And then the,\n",
      "one of them was just a different color, different color pink, is what it ended up being.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "And .\n",
      "When you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall?\n",
      "No\n",
      "I didn't.\n",
      "Or did you start at the edge?\n",
      "Is that how you're supposed to do?\n",
      "I started at one edge and went over,\n",
      "then you had to cut around the closet and cut around a window\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, uh,\n",
      "I've had my best luck in papering when I start in the middle of a wall,\n",
      "and I'll start with a plumb line. And start in the middle of the wall, and, and go from there, and go all the way around the room.\n",
      "And start right there.\n",
      "Do you seem to get it straighter,\n",
      "is that the advantage,\n",
      "or what's the,\n",
      "Well, you, you,\n",
      "Do you have any children?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I have two, two boys, twelve and sixteen.\n",
      "Twelve and sixteen.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "how about you?\n",
      "Well, I have three,\n",
      "and, uh, they're five and three and nineteen months.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "So we kind of got different ball game\n",
      "but, uh.\n",
      "Right\n",
      "What, uh,\n",
      "do you feel like you have any time, to spend with them?\n",
      "Well.\n",
      "They're probably at an age where they don't want to spend any time with their parents.\n",
      "That's true\n",
      "You actually, of course, spend less time with them when they get older,\n",
      "but it's, of course, still really important.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I have a kind of a fortunate situation, I think, right now with my sixteen year old.\n",
      "Um, I work two nights a week at a,\n",
      "I'm a librarian\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "and I work two nights a week at the Senior High School library.\n",
      "They keep it open, you know, for kids to do their work\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and he, um, and then they, the school district hires an aide, you know, to work for me.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Well, my son is my aide.\n",
      "Oh, well, that's nice.\n",
      "So, two nights a week for four hours we're stuck together\n",
      "You're stuck together.\n",
      "and there's usually not very much business.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "I mean, some nights it's just real, real quiet.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "I would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part.\n",
      "So we, I have sort of a captive audience,\n",
      "so I really do spend probably more time with him than, than most, you know.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "But, uh, of course I'm away from my other son those hours, too.\n",
      "But his dad's at home pretty much that time.\n",
      "And so that kind of gives him, uh, time with his dad, then.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's true,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Gives him a little bit of that individual time.\n",
      "But, but it is hard, once they get that age,\n",
      "I mean, their friends are the most important thing there is.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "and they want to be able to spend, uh.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Well, I've even noticed that with my five year old. She started kindergarten this year,\n",
      "and every day that she's not at school, uh, she thinks we need to have someone over and play\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "and that kind of\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's kind of hard.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "it's hard,\n",
      "I think, uh, I find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that I should\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm more worried about, Oh,\n",
      "I didn't this done,\n",
      "I didn't get,\n",
      "the kitchen needs to be cleaned\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "this needs to be done,\n",
      "and and I need to remind myself to slow down\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it'll still be there tomorrow.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's true.\n",
      "But that's kind of hard to do, you know.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "it is hard to do,\n",
      "right,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "You don't see yourself getting.\n",
      "Well, if you're kind of a person that likes things, you know, organized or neat\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "or, you know\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "then I think it, it is hard.\n",
      "It's, um,\n",
      "I think one of the nice things about holidays is that, you know, it does give you the opportunity to spend more time yeah, with family.\n",
      "Slow down a little bit.\n",
      "We have, we often go to Illinois for Christmas,\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "and we're not this year,\n",
      "and it's just really nice because we can do, you know, the things you want to do.\n",
      "You can do, uh, more than than when you travel.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "This is the first year we're staying home, too,\n",
      "and, uh, I think it's going to be real quiet\n",
      "but, uh, that's an opportunity to get out the games\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "See, we usually do that,\n",
      "my, my kids even have already gotten out, um,\n",
      "my twelve year old got out the Legos which of course he hasn't touched since last summer\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Of of course.\n",
      "but, you know, but every now and then, I mean, he's got a lot of those technic, those hard kind,\n",
      "you know, and he wants to be an engineer,\n",
      "so he still likes all that kind of building stuff\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "and, um, we have the train,\n",
      "and we haven't had that Lego train together for years,\n",
      "and, um, so he sat down,\n",
      "and I told him I really wanted him to build the train,\n",
      "and we would put it under the tree, and that I would keep it together,\n",
      "I wouldn't take it apart\n",
      "Wouldn't take it apart after that.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "and every year I'd have the Lego train under the tree.\n",
      "That'd be kind of fun.\n",
      "And, um, so he worked on that for the longest time, ever since school was out on Friday,\n",
      "and, um, then his sixteen year old brother started helping, too, you know.\n",
      "you know, these are kind of things like during the normal rat race\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "those kinds of things never happen\n",
      "No\n",
      "but.\n",
      "no.\n",
      "In fact in, I think if people would learn to turn off the T V\n",
      "and\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication and the communication that would take place in a family,\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Which is,\n",
      "usually people are not sitting in front of that.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "and there's always a few people in the family that, when they stare at it, you know, they're totally turned off to everything else.\n",
      "The rest of.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "and you can't communicate while you're doing that, right?\n",
      "No\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Whereas, uh, I'm the type of person, I could not sit, well,\n",
      "I shouldn't say I could not,\n",
      "but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "me too.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "Because they talk so much,\n",
      "isn't that the,\n",
      "they talk about T V shows,\n",
      "and I, huh,\n",
      "you know, how can you watch that, you know\n",
      "You're kind of like, what are you talking about\n",
      "and, uh,\n",
      "it's the best show on,\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "You feel like you're a little bit out of it, don't you.\n",
      "They need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what's,\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "all set, then.\n",
      "Uh, what do you think about it?\n",
      "Uh, I think it's a real good concept.\n",
      "Uh, drug testing procedures would have to be refined.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "From what I've seen on the news there's a, a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy, poor procedure in, uh, drug testing.\n",
      "Oh, I didn't realize that.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their, in their, uh, test,\n",
      "but they didn't know for sure what it was,\n",
      "but it was a drug,\n",
      "so they got turned down\n",
      "and, uh, turns out it was a prescription. Or people getting somebody else's blood test.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Same sort of problem that happens sometimes is these, some of these, uh, like AIDS tests and such.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "that's right,\n",
      "I have heard,\n",
      "uh, I don't remember what they call it, sort of like a positive, negatives or some, some kind of word they use when a, uh, you get a, uh, a positive indication of drugs,\n",
      "but there's not really, there weren't really any there.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, every now and then there's an error\n",
      "and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I, I work here at Texas Instruments\n",
      "so, uh, we, we do a, let me think, do we, yeah, everyone coming in.\n",
      "I guess I did three years ago.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Everyone coming in, uh, goes through the drug testing procedure\n",
      "and they talk about it as a, you know, as, as better for the country and better for the working conditions.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So if they, uh, they test for drugs.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I, I'm, I can't even remember if we do random sampling anymore.\n",
      "I know we did in the military,\n",
      "but I don't know if once your in they continue to do it,\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "but I guess you're always on call for it.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I not very long ago worked for Wal-Mart\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and about a year and a half ago they instituted a, uh, a, uh, drug testing program, uh, well drug and alcohol testing program.\n",
      "It's, it's not a random\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "through the\n",
      "it,\n",
      "as each employee comes in part of the hiring procedure is a, a blood test Uh,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but I think the big problem, though, is, is they send these off to large labs\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "and then they have thousands and thousands of samples that, uh, going through it in a day and bottles get mixed up, things like that.\n",
      "So your big beef with it is the, uh,\n",
      "It's .\n",
      "Is, is, it's a good idea,\n",
      "but like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Make sure it's a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I I, I tend to agree with you David.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "my brother, uh, brother used to work for Wal-Mart\n",
      "and then, I don't know if he still does or what because I don't know if Sam's is actually part of it,\n",
      "but he, you know is working at Sam's now.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "Sam's is part of Wal-Mart.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "then he's been working for the company for a while, too.\n",
      "He, uh,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Good company, uh,\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "You all, uh, have some,\n",
      "he's telling me about good profit sharing and all that,\n",
      "Company's, that was a great place to work.\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's good news\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they got to had two or three years in with them you can start buying stock\n",
      "and you have a, have a little taken out of your check each, each payday to put against, uh, uh, stock portfolio. Uh, not portfolio, just, you know, against Wal-Mart stock.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, uh, you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's what my brother was telling me.\n",
      "That's good, good good deal.\n",
      "Well, uh, how long were we\n",
      "I haven't done this in a couple months.\n",
      "How long were we supposed to discuss for?\n",
      "Uh, you're supposed to get five minutes.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "we got a couple more minutes then, I guess\n",
      "Uh, think what else I can say about that. Uh,\n",
      "Uh, do you have any idea, uh,\n",
      "let's see,\n",
      "you were, you were tested for drugs as you got into T, as, as you got into T I?\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "uh, everyone coming in gets, goes through the drug test.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, now, uh, were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through\n",
      "or,\n",
      "Uh, no,\n",
      "well, let me think about that.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it was after, I I had already been hired. Uh,\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "you get hired, then you come in the first,\n",
      "I,\n",
      "seems to me I remember that, uh, I was hired, came in and went through some orientation\n",
      "and I thought I,\n",
      "boy, I can't remember.\n",
      "That would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test.\n",
      "Maybe it was during the interview.\n",
      "I came up a couple times for an interview,\n",
      "so it's hard for me to remember where I was when all that happened.\n",
      "But, uh, I guess, just like other companies, other friends I've been hearing about that have been moving around,\n",
      "it's, it's before.\n",
      "They have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment,\n",
      "so I'm sure that happened to me, too.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "What, what about, oh,\n",
      "they just instituted it there at Wal-Mart\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "so,\n",
      "They, they, it was after I was already working there\n",
      "and they weren't testing any of those who were already working.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "now then you heard the question,\n",
      "what  what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, I'll tell you, I used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on, than I do now.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I do, uh, I do the easy stuff now.\n",
      "I change oil,\n",
      "uh, and then what some people would consider a little more difficult, I, I'll change spark plugs\n",
      "and I'll change, you know, points and, you, you know, do air filters, that kind of stuff.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Well.\n",
      "But, uh, I can't do as much as I used to,\n",
      "um, I used to do a whole lot more, but not any more,\n",
      "they're just too weird to work on now.\n",
      "Is that the reason you're not doing it,\n",
      "or are you so busy you don't have time to do it?\n",
      "Well, that's part of it\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "part of it is, like you said, I don't have time.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well being a female and being alone, you, I don't do anything but put gasoline, in my car, and let someone else check the oil even.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, uh, have you had any major repairs recently?\n",
      "Well, um, on this car I've got now, no,\n",
      "but I had a van before,\n",
      "and it was only two years old,\n",
      "and it had transmission go out on it.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "But fortunately that was covered under the warranty.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, you should be, feel very fortunate.\n",
      "I had to have a transmission replaced in an eighty-six automobile\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "and I'll declare, that's an expensive.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Maybe I should have just traded the car in.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "sometimes it makes you wonder.\n",
      "Oh, it just,\n",
      "well, I have a very comfortable car and I have a health problem that I need a large comfortable car.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, um, anyway, I have a new transmission,\n",
      "and I'm sure that any of them would have cost or charged me almost the same amount.\n",
      "But\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "it hurts, it hurts real bad.\n",
      "Did you take it to a dealership?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I took it to an independent out in Garland.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, I see.\n",
      "I had, um,\n",
      "these people were recommended by a neighbor\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, you know, that's the only thing,\n",
      "I am not a native of Dallas.\n",
      "Oh, I see.\n",
      "So that means I have to depend on, on trustworthy friends\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and that's.\n",
      "Anyway, it's fixed,\n",
      "it's running,\n",
      "and I pray that I get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it.\n",
      "Oh, gosh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's going to run for a for a while yet.\n",
      "Oh, I know it.\n",
      "It certainly is frightening.\n",
      "What work are you in?\n",
      "Uh, I, I work for T I.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "I, I work in the networking area.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "okay.\n",
      "Do you work for T I?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "okay.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I have just retired from, um, the Southwest Medical Center.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Yeah, where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car,\n",
      "but they're all too busy.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I have to do it the other way,\n",
      "and that's find someone and pay them to do it.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "So I certainly hope you have a nice New Year.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "I'm, I'm planning on it.\n",
      "Oh, it can't be any worse than last year,\n",
      "that's for sure.\n",
      "Oh, it could be,\n",
      "but I don't much think so\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's true,\n",
      "that's true.\n",
      "I'm, well, we're starting out a new one,\n",
      "so let's make it a good one.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I'm going to try and plan on it.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right, well, I enjoyed the conversation.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "All right, thank you.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "what, um,\n",
      "do you watch much T V\n",
      "or, you know.\n",
      "Um, no,\n",
      "I don't watch much T V.\n",
      "Sometimes, um, usually the reason I will turn it on is to hear the news.\n",
      "The news,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "But I don't think of that every day, even.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, I think I get most of my current events,\n",
      "well, I get them from everywhere.\n",
      "I sometimes watch T V if I,\n",
      "I guess I watch T V if I haven't read the paper that day.\n",
      "We don't get a paper\n",
      "but I work, um, at a,\n",
      "I teach a college class\n",
      "and, uh\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "there's a,\n",
      "the library has a paper.\n",
      "And so I often drop in on a break and and read it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And I keep the radio on quite a bit when I'm home.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And then I, I figure if there's big, big news, I'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or, someone else, you know.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Now I also,\n",
      "I get it from all over.\n",
      "I watch the news every day,\n",
      "and I we have a news,\n",
      "you know, we get the newspaper, and, uh um, magazines, anything.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "You know, I'm,\n",
      "I read a lot,\n",
      "so I get,\n",
      "um, you know, I'm, I'm really up on, uh, current affairs.\n",
      "I get, you know the news and, and everything.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "what's your favorite news,\n",
      "do you get a news magazine\n",
      "or,\n",
      "Um, well, I'm not getting\n",
      "no,\n",
      "I'm not getting any news magazines\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, um, you know, as, as I said, I do,\n",
      "it's, uh, it's easy to keep up on current you know on you know, especially when you, um you know, you get a paper every day.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we've got.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "exactly.\n",
      "And, uh.\n",
      "Are you satisfied with the quality of coverage?\n",
      "Uh, I don't know\n",
      "Is there anything missing?\n",
      "I, you know,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's kind of hard to know.\n",
      "And I don't know, you know, what, what's, I mean, what are we supposed to, uh, compare it to you know, I mean, the quality, uh,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "whatever they tell you,\n",
      "you know, I, uh, I guess I, I, you know, I'm satisfied.\n",
      "I mean, I,\n",
      "uh, you know, they, they're supposedly covering everything that happens,\n",
      "so\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "you know.\n",
      "Well, I do feel like, a little bit like,\n",
      "being from California and wanting to hear like\n",
      "I've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something,\n",
      "and\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "I don't ever hear it in the news here.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Well, uh, sometimes it's such a,\n",
      "you know, it's, it's so, um, slight, you know like the tremors are so slight that they don't even bother putting it in the paper.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But most of the the times I find that even if there are, you know, they do have like tremors out there, you know, there'll be a small article in the paper about it.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "But, uh.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "I sometimes feel like, um, the Dallas paper and the DALLAS NEWS, um, the top headlines are always a murder, you know.\n",
      "Oh, well.  That's what sells papers.\n",
      "That  that's because there's a high crime rate.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's, um, that's been like that since they, the first newspaper, you know\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I'm sure.\n",
      "You know, but, um, I don't know.\n",
      "I, I guess I'm satisfied,\n",
      "I don't, uh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I mean, what basis, you know, of comparison do we have really?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "really.\n",
      "We don't get a, you know.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "We certainly get enough coverage.\n",
      "I mean, we, we can get news,\n",
      "you know, I mean, there's even the C N N channel where we can get world news twenty-four hours a day.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "I was going to.\n",
      "Sure,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Sometimes you don't even want to be bothered with the news because it's all so bad\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "It's all so negative, you know.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "often times.\n",
      "But.\n",
      "So. Yeah.\n",
      "Well, we have to keep talking, I guess\n",
      "Well, no,\n",
      "I guess we can end.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's just whenever we're, um.\n",
      "Oh, is it really?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Have you always gone until the recording?\n",
      "Well, yeah,\n",
      "I don't, I don't, uh,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I guess we're not supposed to\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "we're I guess we're supposed to wait\n",
      "or I don't know.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I,\n",
      "you know, like one, uh, well,\n",
      "was it last week, we were supposed to talk about gardening\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "uh, and it was really funny,\n",
      "I, I, I mixed it, made the call,\n",
      "and it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away.\n",
      "Oh, really.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and it was really.\n",
      "We were laughing,\n",
      "I mean. But, you know, we don't really do any gardening,\n",
      "so like, that took like a minute\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and then we just talked about, you know, whatever, I mean.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Interesting.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You know, I mean, some topics,\n",
      "really now, you know, now, this topic, this is, I mean,\n",
      "there really isn't much to say after you know, you, uh, you know, you, you tell the person what, uh, news there, uh, you know, where their, where they find their sources of information from\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and then, you know, if it's, uh, if they're satisfied,\n",
      "and that's about it, really.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's hard to talk for five minutes on this\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "So, um.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, I guess I can just say I, it bothers me that I hear a lot about, um, you know, on the news that,\n",
      "well, it seems like, I don't know, some things are sensationalized or some things are, um,\n",
      "you know, you'll hear one report\n",
      "and then you'll hear that it, you know, they didn't, um.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, what are your favorite shows?\n",
      "Um, I like watching COLOMBO and, um, MATLOCK and QUANTUM LEAP,\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "QUANTUM LEAP?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Did you see it the other night?\n",
      "Um, uh-huh.\n",
      "That was, that was pretty good.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that one was.\n",
      "What about,\n",
      "What do you,\n",
      "with the psychic and everything?\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I like, uh, I like NORTHERN EXPOSURE and, uh, HOME IMPROVEMENT.\n",
      "Oh, I, well I haven't seen either of those\n",
      "You've never seen NORTHERN EXPOSURE?\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Oh, it's a great show.\n",
      "Um, I also like to watch STAR TREK,\n",
      "but it's on so late here, that I don't always get to see it\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we like it, too.\n",
      "Have you seen the movie?\n",
      "Uh, I haven't seen any of the movies because I just barely, just like in the last year or so got interested in it,\n",
      "and they're, you know, already out with number six by now,\n",
      "but. So I haven't seen any of the movies, yet,\n",
      "but I.\n",
      "Oh, you haven't seen any of them.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Oh, well, they're good,\n",
      "they're real good.\n",
      "They're, uh, they're getting rid of the old cast for the movies, though.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Which ones are you watching, the new ones?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I've seen quite a few of the older ones.\n",
      "I haven't seen really the new generation that much.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Is there one you prefer better, the older one or the the newer one?\n",
      "Well, they're, they're a lot different.\n",
      "But, I like, I like the older ones because at that time, you know, they were really futuristic, you know.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "And the newer ones are, I guess the newer ones are real futuristic, too,\n",
      "but I like, I like both of them.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I do too.\n",
      "I have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a lot,\n",
      "I mean, he almost hates the new ones\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "because he, he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something,\n",
      "but, I don't\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Not really.\n",
      "It's not really like   a soap  opera,\n",
      "Oh, I think,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but, but it's,\n",
      "but that's true,\n",
      "I mean, you, you learn more about the characters and stuff,\n",
      "but that's the way all shows are now.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "sure.\n",
      "Well, let's see.\n",
      "Um, I like to watch COLOMBO because it's like a mystery thing.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's sort of how Matlock is,\n",
      "but COLOMBO is way tricky\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean he doesn't even try to let the person know he's getting onto them.\n",
      "Well, it seems like they always  show COLOMBO, the same ones over and over, though you know what I'm saying, like that one where he goes to college,\n",
      "Well, did you see the one.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "or is this, is there a series on.\n",
      "Um, yeah,\n",
      "there's like one on,\n",
      "well we see it Thursdays at seven,\n",
      "and  it was,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "this last time it was about this, um, movie director,\n",
      "did you\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I saw that one.\n",
      "did you see that?\n",
      "See, that was a rerun.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Oh, I guess I\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I wondered if that's\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "see I don't know if that's a, the movie of the week or, or what,\n",
      "but it seems like there's only about four or five different ones,\n",
      "and then, then they keep showing them over and over.\n",
      "Oh, I guess I've, I haven't seen it before.\n",
      "He was a movie director,\n",
      "and he had that gal killed.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "on the set or something.\n",
      "That was pretty good though\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it was.\n",
      "But, yeah,\n",
      "I like COLOMBO probably the best of any of those mystery things.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, um, there's no, never anything good on Saturdays, though\n",
      "No kidding.\n",
      "I don't think so.\n",
      "Well, STAR TREK'S on at five,\n",
      "but I'm never home\n",
      "so,\n",
      "What is it that,\n",
      "there's something I watch, something I watch on Saturdays,\n",
      "and I can't remember what it is.\n",
      "Now I used to watch TWIN PEAKS.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "You never saw that?\n",
      "I've heard of it a lot,\n",
      "I've heard of,\n",
      "a lot of people somehow or something\n",
      "They'll say, so and so from TWIN PEAKS, or something, you know.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "that was a different soap opera.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "But, it was, it was a different type of show.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I didn't like the way it ended, though.\n",
      "Oh, did they end the whole series?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they didn't, they only did it for, I think, two years.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "But it's all over now.\n",
      "Oh, another show I like to watch is MASH.\n",
      "So. How's your products been?\n",
      "Um, I really haven't had, uh, too many problems.\n",
      "Uh, seems to me that everything that I buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out.\n",
      "I hear that one.\n",
      "Have you had any lately go out?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I've had a dryer, an ice maker, a microwave, all three,\n",
      "and they,\n",
      "unfortunately I bought them all three at the same time, when I bought my new house,\n",
      "and, uh, I really don't have any recourse,\n",
      "so I had to call and have them all repaired and that.\n",
      "Oh, wow.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it was a hassle.\n",
      "So you didn't get anything,\n",
      "even, all the, all the warranties were out?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "the warranty on the refrigerator, uh,\n",
      "the\n",
      "the refrigerator warranty's still good,\n",
      "but the ice maker itself, passed its three years,\n",
      "and it was three years and two months.\n",
      "You're kidding.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we just moved into a new house, too,\n",
      "so we had to buy all those, too.\n",
      "Uh, watch out.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "the only thing I've had problems with is, um,\n",
      "I buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such,\n",
      "and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "I didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than,\n",
      "I just ended up using it.\n",
      "But, that's about the only thing I've had gone wrong.\n",
      "But.\n",
      "I usually have pretty good luck with appliances,\n",
      "but I just, uh,\n",
      "it was within two days that all three of these stopped working,\n",
      "and the the ice maker was, uh, had to have a new pump,\n",
      "That's incredible.\n",
      "and the, uh, microwave had to have, uh, some kind of something I can't even pronounce,\n",
      "and they, uh,\n",
      "the dryer had to have a new heating element,\n",
      "so it was about, almost three hundred dollars for all three of them.\n",
      "And they all went out at the same time?\n",
      "Uh, within two days of each other.\n",
      "Or two days.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "I was,\n",
      "it wasn't a good week.\n",
      "I was pretty mad.\n",
      "And plus the place that I'd bought them all had gone out of business,\n",
      "so even if I, I think even if I had, uh, had kept the warranty, the service agreements were with the companies that, that manufactured,\n",
      "but still they were through that retailer,\n",
      "so I don't know if I could have taken it to another retailer or not.\n",
      "Wow,\n",
      "it's frustrating.\n",
      "But I didn't have to worry about all that, because they weren't under warranty.\n",
      "So. It was a call to the local appliance dealer who came out and fixed them all,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, I,\n",
      "the only other things that I've ever had trouble with, uh,\n",
      "I seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers, blow dryers.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "they go out a lot?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I've had two or three of those go out.\n",
      "One was under warranty,\n",
      "and the other two weren't,\n",
      "but, I just,\n",
      "other than that, you know, T V and things like that, I haven't ever had any trouble with.\n",
      "I don't think products are getting much better though.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "See I'm in the manufacturing\n",
      "home from work\n",
      "and make, um, automotive air bags, the safety air bags.\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's interesting.\n",
      "At Morton International,\n",
      "and, I\n",
      "well, it's, it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment.\n",
      "We test everything after each assembly process,\n",
      "and so our testing is pretty thorough,\n",
      "but.\n",
      "Do you, do you test each individual one\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "or do you just test,\n",
      "like if you've got ten, you test one,\n",
      "and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay?\n",
      "Um, the tests that,\n",
      "well, we test every one electrically.\n",
      "We don't,\n",
      "I think they test four or five a day, actually exploding the air bags\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, but we do test after, during the assembly project, product, um, after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag, we check to make sure it's there after we install it,\n",
      "so, each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done,\n",
      "and then we do electrical tests on them during the process,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Well, that's something I've never had to use,\n",
      "it's never, I've never been involved in an automobile accident,\n",
      "so, luckily that's a product that I haven't had to test.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But I think it's a great idea.\n",
      "I'm, I'm,\n",
      "seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about\n",
      "but that.\n",
      "Well, they do the, all the testing that we have to do through the government,\n",
      "it's incredible how much testing they have to do.\n",
      "Oh, I'm sure they want to be thorough before they.\n",
      "But, uh, even,\n",
      "you know, I don't mind spending the extra money on the car if, you know, even if they pass the savings, the cost onto the consumer, because it just seems like a real worthwhile thing.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I'm not a real big seat belt,\n",
      "my, uh,\n",
      "Well Jackie, uh, on taxes, I, I guess I would have to say, that I, that my opinion is that I do think Americans are paying too much in taxes.\n",
      "Uh, what's your feeling about that?\n",
      "I agree.\n",
      "I think taxes are high.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "uh, where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both?\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, uh-huh.\n",
      "In New Hampshire we have, uh, uh, no, no, what we call broad base taxes.\n",
      "No income tax and no sales tax.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Uh, we tax business, uh, eight percent,\n",
      "businesses are taxed eight percent\n",
      "and we have what we call the five B s. Uh, for our taxes. Booze, uh, butts, cigarettes, beds, uh, hotel room tax bellies, a meal tax and bets, gambling.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "So, uh, we do have a very low tax rate,\n",
      "but you know, combined with the federal income tax. I think that Americans generally do pay too much in taxes\n",
      "and .\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, I agree\n",
      "and I, think it's about the time of the year when you just start getting,\n",
      "well if you do get money back from like jobs,\n",
      "I'm still a student so, uh, I only work part time,\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "so I, I get a check back\n",
      "so\n",
      "Well that's nice.\n",
      "from, from taxes\n",
      "but,\n",
      "Nice, nice to get a refund.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "It is,\n",
      "but it's not much.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Do you think that, uh, for whatever taxes we do pay that, uh, we are getting value for it?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, my, my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to Washington or to the state\n",
      "and they say they are going to send some back,\n",
      "it's like giving yourself a it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You know what I mean?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, it, it really, uh,\n",
      "I should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because,  Right because, uh, there's an old saying in amongst taxes and politicians that there's a fly paper effect\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "There you go\n",
      "and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first\n",
      "and when you send it to Washington or send it to your state capitol, uh, a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I,\n",
      "don't seem like they are doing much with it,\n",
      "I mean there's plans there\n",
      "and now that they are voting and people, you know, getting into drug and that stuff.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "They have nice plans\n",
      "and, uh, but, they don't always work\n",
      "and then you know they try to raise taxes more\n",
      "and I don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work,\n",
      "you know, but taxes get raise\n",
      "so. I don't know.\n",
      "I'm not really into politics, uh\n",
      "That it,\n",
      "I don't really understand it\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but it's just you know\n",
      "Well, it does it, it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend.\n",
      "Uh, it's almost like they will spend as much as the, they're allowed to collect. You know.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh, there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax. Uh, ten percent or thirteen percent.\n",
      "There would be no figuring.\n",
      "I mean you would take your income tax,\n",
      "you would have a certain amount,\n",
      "I mean you would take you total salary\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes,\n",
      "and then there would be a set amount for however many people, you know, dependent you have,\n",
      "and you would just pay a flat tax. No exemptions, no deductions or anything else after you know, after you figure up who's in your family.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "And that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the I R S\n",
      "and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "The could be nice\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "I, I'd like to see something like that.\n",
      "I think it would be fairer\n",
      "and it would put a, you know, a lot of the tax attorneys our of business\n",
      "and I am sure they will fight it tooth and nail,\n",
      "but I really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all Americans.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "I mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "huh.\n",
      "It doesn't seem fair to me.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it isn't,\n",
      "there is not much out there that is fair,\n",
      "that's for sure.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "I will agree to that.\n",
      "I think your taxes in Wisconsin are pretty high. I, I, if I am not mistaken, aren't they? I mean for your state.\n",
      "Uh,\n",
      "What is, do you know what your state income tax rate is?\n",
      "Um, no\n",
      "Twenty percent?\n",
      "I, I have no idea,\n",
      "I just.\n",
      "My dad does it all for me\n",
      "Just, you just pay it, huh\n",
      "I use,\n",
      "You're like, you're like my daughter who is in college down in Massachusetts\n",
      "and, uh, she works as a waitress\n",
      "and she is attending college full time also\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and she sends her taxes to me\n",
      "and I figure them up.\n",
      "She really has no idea.\n",
      "She gets a refund check\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "How do you keep up with current events?\n",
      "Um, well actually, usually, uh, in the mornings I am getting ready to either go to work, uh,\n",
      "usually catch the news in the morning.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "what what channel do you watch or what station?\n",
      "Uh, N B C.\n",
      "That's the one I watch.\n",
      "I usually keep up with T V.\n",
      "I don't,\n",
      "I am a student\n",
      "so I really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so I get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't too great sometimes\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I usually tend to just, you know, rely on, you know, T V, uh, again, you know, just through the grapevine just, just to know like, you know like what today's stories are\n",
      "and I usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know I'm interested in any particular one.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "The radio doesn't really have much news sometimes.\n",
      "The stations I listen to are just mainly music.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Do you think that T V is, uh, pretty accurate.\n",
      "I mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized\n",
      "or,\n",
      "Well, what I really don't like about T V, especially local news as compared to like national news is just, uh, it seems, it seems like everything is very spoon feed\n",
      "and you know it's, it's more like the news shows is now is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom or like the news, because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports, you know, is your kid's bus driver smoking crack, on the way to school, you know?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's\n",
      "they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Also, also I have the observation of, uh, with the press is that, like any any stories that I had any first hand knowledge of that I see in the press, you know, which only happened like ten times in my life you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had, had more than just a blurb about it. That the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "it's something wrong.\n",
      "Going,\n",
      "they're, looks like they're going more for ratings than for you know actual news.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I think, you know the probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "they typically have a better.\n",
      "I am from a small town too here in Texas and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "the farm report.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "farm report and oil reports.\n",
      "That's pretty pretty sad\n",
      "or who killed who.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Also I have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television .\n",
      "Read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, in, uh, in Dallas, I don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Luby's\n",
      "and the story was, uh,\n",
      "Was that like he started shooting people, people in this cafeteria or something?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And the news covered it right, you know, hours after it happened\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they were taping people who were crying who had everything\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and then like three days later this, uh, local news station was using as as their promo to promote themselves.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I just thought that was really that's kind of cold,\n",
      "Oh yeah,\n",
      "I have seen that happen lots of times.\n",
      "You know, uh, Channel X gives you the best coverage\n",
      "you know we were on the scene with our team players\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "and it was just,\n",
      "they were showing like these dead people\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "and they were showing people crying\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "I mean just taking advantage of you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "They are trying to get the, you know, most emotional response for,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story,\n",
      "but just the play on people's emotions\n",
      "It's just gotten so,\n",
      "I mean, somewhere there's, it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite that if you know\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "and everything.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "You know, I've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "uh, you know even the national news I just find it to be you know very watered down,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "very,\n",
      "What did you think of the coverage of the war?\n",
      "Uh, I I found it very one sided.\n",
      "Did you?\n",
      "Uh, you know, it, it just seemed to lack any sort of debate.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, you know, not saying that we that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there,\n",
      "but it just seemed like, you know.\n",
      "They kept just showing, you know, how great we were doing\n",
      "and it never really showed what actually the damage that really happened that's\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the, you know, the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they kind of you know,\n",
      "if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who you know got really hurt and everything.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and I really think that you know in the involvement that the press states, you know that the the military basically sets the press,\n",
      "Think about, uh, taxes.\n",
      "Well, I think they're a necessary evil.\n",
      "Uh, I wish the government would operate on the same premise that, uh, businesses operate on\n",
      "and that is, uh you, you don't spend more than you, than you bring in.\n",
      "You spend what you have\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I think that, the general idea is to you know, spend, uh, during a time of recession that, you know, for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy,\n",
      "but they're running under the\n",
      "you know, the way they're running it now, they're you know, running it under a deficit spending, you know, while we're not under a recession,\n",
      "so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running,\n",
      "so that's kind of a basic thing of economics, I guess, keep spending, keep going into debt,\n",
      "you're not going to payoff what you owe,\n",
      "but, so, I guess the, the question was more like, uh, do you get what you pay you know, get what you pay for.\n",
      "Well, I,\n",
      "it just depends.\n",
      "Uh, uh, roads are very expensive, uh, commodity and so is, uh, utilities they supply and police and fire department, uh,\n",
      "you know, they need to make a living.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "There's,\n",
      "So I think for, for, for many years, uh, we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are, uh, to a great extent, public servants uh, we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I agree with that.\n",
      "But, uh, then again, uh, it's the, hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of, of, uh, government, including municipalities as well as state and federal governments.\n",
      "I guess,\n",
      "I'm, I'm a student right now\n",
      "and I don't make a whole lot of money\n",
      "and, so, I, I kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to, I guess, uh, compared to what I get, because I, you know, all my, my education is state sponsored.\n",
      "I go to a state sponsored school\n",
      "and, uh, my education all up through high school and stuff,\n",
      "so I guess I'm kind of in debt, I, I suppose, because I don't, you know, been paying taxes all that, all that long.\n",
      "My parents, I guess, however, have contributed to that, you know, for the education side of it and everything,\n",
      "but, uh, I usually end up getting money back.\n",
      "I will this year anyway from a,\n",
      "Uh, you're very fortunate.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I am\n",
      "I need it, too,\n",
      "otherwise,\n",
      "We just try not to pay any more in than we have to,\n",
      "uh, we pay in a substantial amount. Uh,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "We don't regret paying taxes.\n",
      "We do think that, uh, sometimes, uh, we have a reverse of a regressive tax, a progressive tax.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And progressive tax, I think, uh, does not give people incentive to make more money,\n",
      "and what I mean by that, the more income you make, the more tax you pay.\n",
      "More taxes you pay.\n",
      "It should be, I think, a flat percentage\n",
      "and, uh, that percentage ought to be an equitable amount.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Isn't,\n",
      "Uh, last year when they passed the tax laws for the, uh, nineteen ninety, ninety-one, whatever, nineteen ninety-one uh, I added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I totaled them all up\n",
      "and basically, uh, we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Now, that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every, for every item on there even though there's, uh, taxes on different things.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well isn't,\n",
      "But, you know, there's there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying, uh,\n",
      "like when you buy a tire, you pay a federal excise tax.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "there's a lot, yeah, lot of hidden taxes.\n",
      "You pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your, your tank.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "The taxes that people don't think about that,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "the, the, the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay, I guess.\n",
      "But you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "There was that,\n",
      "which\n",
      "was it Jerry Brown,\n",
      "one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the, the tax codes they have now and implementing a I think a flat percentage, something like that.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "if you implemented a flat percentage, it would encourage people, uh, to make more money\n",
      "and the, what people need to understand in my opinion, now this is just my opinion, okay, uh, is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, so, if they penalize businesses, business people are smart enough to say, here's my break point, I'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "That's, because until, like eight,\n",
      "And so,\n",
      "Based on that, who do you think you're talking to,\n",
      "you're talking to an employer.\n",
      "Up until, like, eighty-five or something was the,\n",
      "Well, actually, uh,\n",
      "I, I don't think I'm in the, uh, majority of, in, in Texas\n",
      "I don't think I agree with,\n",
      "Oh really.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "You don't believe in it?\n",
      "Uh, I wouldn't say that.\n",
      "I think I would have said that a few years ago.\n",
      "When I was younger I thought it was, uh, a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have, uh, capital punishment\n",
      "but, um, uh, maybe slowly changing my opinion.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm not thoroughly opposed to it.\n",
      "I still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment\n",
      "but I'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than I thought\n",
      "You sound a lot like a friend of mine. A a girl I hang out with.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "She has very, very black and white opinions, you know.\n",
      "There's no gray in her opinions, you know.\n",
      "She, she probably would agree more with you\n",
      "but, but I don't know.\n",
      "I think I would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again.\n",
      "I've never had a, a punishment or a, a crime like a murder touch my immediate family\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but I still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to, to punish, especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And we see that more and more.\n",
      "Like in our state right now, there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "you know, that's fourteen years old.\n",
      "What's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I certainly don't, uh, advocate turning people like that loose.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm not sure executing them, uh, does anymore than keeping them in jail,\n",
      "but, uh,\n",
      "No\n",
      "it doesn't\n",
      "but, it costs less.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That, that's a factor.\n",
      "And, yeah,\n",
      "to me it is.\n",
      "I mean, I work and I pay my taxes\n",
      "and I lived out in Texas for a little while\n",
      "and they're\n",
      "and that's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia\n",
      "I mean you guys are, are a lot more, uh, for to each his own even than we are in Georgia.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "But even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part.\n",
      "If I work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But when I've got to work to pay my dues and your dues then I don't like you very much anymore.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, I,\n",
      "the cost is something\n",
      "but it's, but I think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of, dealing with crime\n",
      "and I guess I would like,\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "the European countries certainly, uh, none of them have capital punishment\n",
      "and they  they don't have a crime problem either.\n",
      "Oh, really.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "you can't,\n",
      "they don't execute anybody in Britain or France\n",
      "and I don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either\n",
      "and they don't have the crime problems we do.\n",
      "I don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I guess what worries me about capital punishment is, uh, when I see people enthusiastic about it and, uh, uh, sort of bloodthirsty. I think it brings out the worst in the, in the people who do the punishing\n",
      "and the, that, that bothers me.\n",
      "You might be right.\n",
      "But it,\n",
      "but, uh,\n",
      "I mean I, I'd hate to be the person to pull the switch, you know,\n",
      "I would never in a million years want that job\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "but I do believe it's necessary\n",
      "and I,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "On the one hand I, I guess I admire the person who has the guts to do it because I couldn't I couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "and I couldn't pull the switch\n",
      "but, uh,\n",
      "Well actually I,\n",
      "the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because I don't really think it, uh, I don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else.\n",
      "I think it just becomes a, uh, symbolic I'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians\n",
      "so\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I would like for it to be settled once for all and, uh, get in the background while the more important issues get discussed, uh, uh,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Like I said, some years ago, I think I would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the, civilized western country.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Now I'm, I'm not so sure of that.\n",
      "I'm, I, I wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and  nor the other way around.\n",
      "What  what's making you become more convinced that it might be a good way of punishing\n",
      "Uh, I guess I'm, I'm,\n",
      "my view of uh,\n",
      "my,\n",
      "I'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and, uh, that, uh, uh, costs and other factors justify, uh, uh, executing people.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that, uh, uh, than anything else\n",
      "and, uh, I've also never been a victim although I have some, I have two friends whose wives were murdered\n",
      "and, uh  I can imagine that, uh, uh, for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case.\n",
      "Oh, gosh\n",
      "Oh yes,\n",
      "if it ever touched my\n",
      "I don't know what you drive now.\n",
      "I mean, what do you drive now?\n",
      "Uh, I have a Ford pickup\n",
      "and, uh, the family car is a, uh, a Dodge Caravan. And, uh, because we have three kids and they're under thirteen\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "so, uh\n",
      "Throw them in the back.\n",
      "they sort of fit our requirement.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I have a, one of those, uh, pickups with the, uh, seat  with a seat in the back.\n",
      "Cab.\n",
      "Oh, yeah?\n",
      "And so they just fit in there.\n",
      "When they get to be teenagers with long legs, it may not work.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Right now, I can, right now, I can throw them all in the back when we have room\n",
      "and, uh and since I do a lot of projects, I throw things in the back\n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "and I kind of like having a pickup truck.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "Actually, I think of it as a as a car that'll last\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "I like the way trucks are built\n",
      "and I don't care about comfort.\n",
      "So, I'm pretty happy.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "you're looking at,\n",
      "I got a Toyota Four Runner.\n",
      "I wanted a truck that I, I wanted something that I could throw people in the back too,\n",
      "so I got a Four Runner.\n",
      "So I wouldn't hesitate to get another one.\n",
      "I, I never buy new\n",
      "so I wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck.\n",
      "You're just like me.\n",
      "I've never bought a new vehicle in my life.\n",
      "And, uh, yeah,\n",
      "I don't, I don't need to pay for the glitz.\n",
      "I'll let somebody else, uh, have the showroom shine\n",
      "No.\n",
      "and I'll pay for the rest of it.\n",
      "Let somebody else break it in,\n",
      "right\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And, uh, the van we're\n",
      "we might go again on a, on a van.\n",
      "We, we could probably do with a, a, something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time.\n",
      "I'm not sure.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We have to, we, we'll have to face it in a couple of years\n",
      "but, uh,  I, I guess, we had a small Toyota wagon\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and we were real happy with that because, uh, my, my second requirement after price is, uh, low maintenance.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And, uh, it certainly had that.\n",
      "We didn't do much to it at all.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "my, my,\n",
      "pretty much the same.\n",
      "I, I got a, like I say I got one of those Toyota Four Runners\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, it pretty much does everything I need it to.\n",
      "I mean, it, it'll tow three thousand pounds\n",
      "so I can tow everything\n",
      "and it,\n",
      "I can throw,\n",
      "I've had eleven people in it before Believe it or not.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, it's real reliable,\n",
      "I, I mean I've had it for almost four years now\n",
      "and up until, oh, say two weeks ago, it had never had anything wrong with it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And then, of course, two weeks ago, it decided,\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "it's the strangest, weirdest thing in the world,\n",
      "but it blew a head gasket.\n",
      "Uh-oh.\n",
      "Didn't do any damage to it.\n",
      "Uh, I caught  it real early.\n",
      "How,\n",
      "at how  at how many miles?\n",
      "Uh, oh ninety-seven thousand.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "So it's not real early\n",
      "You didn't overheat it?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Never overheated it.\n",
      "I smell, I smelled the, uh, I smelled the coolant\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Went out and looked.\n",
      "Saw it was, saw where it was coming from.\n",
      "Drove it right to the shop and left it off.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Well that was, ,\n",
      "And that was it\n",
      "because I, I have that\n",
      "and then I have a, a Kawasaki motorcycle. Which is, actually, the, usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean that's, that's sort of my, hobby though more than a vehicle.\n",
      "It, it's a\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "people who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves\n",
      "I have one colleague that, uh, commutes to work on one when it's not raining\n",
      "and, uh, uh, he's a,\n",
      "it's,\n",
      "he's pretty conservative guy.\n",
      "I don't think it's much of a sport for him. I guess, uh,\n",
      "I know\n",
      "but I bet you he really enjoys riding it.\n",
      "I'm sure he does,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, you know,\n",
      "when was the last time you took out, took your truck out just to, just to go driving?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "No\n",
      "And I go out twice a week on the bike, so. At least. Just for  the enjoyment.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh .\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "But, yeah,\n",
      "I, I mean, the only thing I think I might get, a new car or, not necessarily a new car but, a, another car,\n",
      "uh, I would consider going to a, a non, to a normal pickup rather than a, a covered pickup like the one I've got. Just because there's a lot of times I wished I had, just an open bed to throw stuff in.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I'm sure, I'm sure that that's very,\n",
      "I mean you got one.\n",
      "It's, that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back\n",
      "and,\n",
      "If I only had some place that I could store the, uh, camper top, I would have it off most of the time.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I really leave it on there just for, just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty.\n",
      "To have it out of the way.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "But, uh, they're solid.\n",
      "Uh, trucks are built, uh, I mean,\n",
      "I think they last a lot longer than anything else.\n",
      "They're the only things Americans still know how to build\n",
      "and, uh\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "the trucks do.\n",
      "Uh, even though, you know, the Jap, the little Jap trucks are, are good there too.\n",
      "But so are the,\n",
      "though I think the Chevies,\n",
      "I don't think the\n",
      "I don't like the Chevies as much as I like the Fords.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I think they, I think the Fords tend to last a little longer.  At least until recently\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I  I kind of like mine,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "so, mine's a Ford\n",
      "A friend of mine just bought , bought like a year ago. It, it's a really nice truck.\n",
      "I mean, I don't like Dodges at all\n",
      "but one of the Dodges they have out now has a, uh, the Cummins turbo diesel on it.\n",
      "Oh, I heard about that,\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "Oh, it's beautiful.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That thing, that thing will last forever I mean ,\n",
      "That, that's a serious truck.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "that thing's, uh,\n",
      "it's got a boat engine in it\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "this, uh,\n",
      "I, I know a contractor who just got one of those.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "He's pleased with it.\n",
      "Well I haven't had an awful lot of, uh, incidents regarding child care.\n",
      "When my two year old was in New Orleans, she got bit on the cheek\n",
      "and, uh, but, uh, that's about the, the, uh, the extent of it.\n",
      "But, but, but when,\n",
      "I really am, am concerned about is that, uh, so many of these child care places are, are coming under, uh, uh, you know, investigation for, for, uh, you know, child molestation.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I, and I, and I'm saying to myself, well, you know, you dump your, your, your little turnip off to, uh, you know, this child care place\n",
      "and they don't pay very much\n",
      "and why, why would they be interested in, in your little turnip unless, you know, one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest, you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, that's a terrible kind of thing\n",
      "and I don't think my children have ever been subject to that\n",
      "but my wife didn't work\n",
      "and so we really didn't have that much exposure to it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well I am a working mother\n",
      "I have three children\n",
      "and my children, since I, uh, since they were very young,\n",
      "I've had various, um, different alternatives, child care arrangements\n",
      "and like most working mothers I'm really not defensive about it.\n",
      "I personally feel, uh, in our particular situation, I'm a much better mother when I work out of the home\n",
      "and my kids, I think, are very, very secure, well raised children.\n",
      "My comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune over the years for a variety of opportunities.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "So I, I, I,\n",
      "you know, it is a problem.\n",
      "And, but as you pointed out, I, I think the real problem is the low pay child facilities\n",
      "and that is sometimes what some women who have to work, that is all they can afford.\n",
      "When our children were very young, we had a pay, a live in paid baby-sitter that was wonderful.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "And then as they got older, they went to, uh, I preferred to call them schools\n",
      "and they were really all day preschools\n",
      "and they were wonderful.\n",
      "And I think they got exposed to a lot of neat things.\n",
      "Oh, well that's interesting.\n",
      "But we did, we really truly did pay a fortune.\n",
      "I mean we were paying at one point, well about, about a, close, about five hundred dollars a week for two children.\n",
      "Oh, my God.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "Well you must have a, just one hero ace professional job to support something like that.\n",
      "Well, I\n",
      "I'm a physician. Uh  and, as is my husband.\n",
      "Oh, well, yeah\n",
      "And, and I felt, uh, very good about working.\n",
      "I'm a pediatrician actually.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, uh, but I think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children\n",
      "but, and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for. I think,\n",
      "Well, not, not all of us.\n",
      "You know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for.\n",
      "I'm an engineer.\n",
      "Oh. Well\n",
      "And,\n",
      "I think it's real important that you have a place that, first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in.\n",
      "And we had a really wonderful arrangement, uh,\n",
      "I'm with the university actually\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they had a wonderful, uh, program that started at age three\n",
      "and it was about a block away from the hospital where I work.\n",
      "And so, many times, at lunchtime, I would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing.\n",
      "And they had wonderful,\n",
      "they had things like gardens and lots of pets\n",
      "and just, they had a four to one uh, teacher student ratio.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So that, that sort of an,\n",
      "most of the teachers had degrees. Uh,\n",
      "Five hundred dollars a week.  For two kids.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's incredible.\n",
      "It was incredible actually\n",
      "Oh, oh.\n",
      "But it was good.\n",
      "I mean it was, it,\n",
      "at that time there were two children\n",
      "and they were in special programs\n",
      "and each one was a little over two hundred a week\n",
      "and then, in addition, I paid a little bit extra.\n",
      "But the kids were,\n",
      "Well.\n",
      "I mean they really had some great opportunities.\n",
      "But,\n",
      "what you were alluding to earlier is, you know, women who work for minimal wage  and, and really have feel they have to put their children,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "sometimes they do put them in, uh, fairly low  paying situations.\n",
      "You know,\n",
      "they could,\n",
      "somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare\n",
      "and you know, that's a good starting wage\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but boy three hundred dollars a week doesn't go very far on child care.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "even that, that really, I think, I don't,\n",
      "it's been awhile since I've looked at,\n",
      "my youngest child is eight.\n",
      "So it's been a little while since I've looked into, actually daycare centers.\n",
      "But they are\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "you know, the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since .\n",
      "I mean we used to pay, pay fifty cents an hour to baby-sit.\n",
      "But mine are twenty-two, twenty-three and twenty-seven\n",
      "so you know, that,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I guess baby-sitters now are up at, what, five dollars an hour?\n",
      "Something like that.\n",
      "Oh my.\n",
      "Well, you know, but you made the comment earlier, why would someone be interested in children.\n",
      "I mean it has been a real, uh,\n",
      "there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences.\n",
      "And I think, I think they have captured a certain market.\n",
      "Again the,\n",
      "but then there are baby-sitting groups.\n",
      "As a pediatrician, one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "As you start putting lots of little kids together, the infection rates that go around\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Hi, Cynthia.\n",
      "What did you wear to work today?\n",
      "Um, let's see.\n",
      "What did I wear to work today?\n",
      "Um, actually I wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse, um, and flat shoes.\n",
      "So, can you dress pretty casually?\n",
      "Um, on occasion. On occasion.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Um, I do vary.\n",
      "Um, you know, I wear suits,\n",
      "I wear skirts and sweaters.\n",
      "On occasion I can wear jeans.\n",
      "Um, how about you?\n",
      "Well, I, um, run a business out of my home.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So I tend to get up in the morning, put on, sweats, um, do whatever I want to do with the kids, then whenever I have a meeting with a client, I'll put a suit on. And then come home and get back into regular clothes again\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, you know, there's real no, no real dress code where I work.\n",
      "Um, you see people wearing, you know, all different attire.\n",
      "I, um, don't like to wear heels, that really tires me out.\n",
      "I work in a big building.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, I predominantly wear flat shoes.\n",
      "Um, you know, in the winter I wear sweaters,\n",
      "in summer I, you know, I like one piece dresses, short sleeves, things like that.\n",
      "I've recently, um, tried to update my wardrobe, trying to put suits together that I can interchange, the, jackets and the blouses and all that a lot.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "That's helped me a lot with having,\n",
      "I can only have a, a limited wardrobe, since I'm only, working part-time right now.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, but still, it gives it some variety. Add different blouses and scarves and belts and things like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right,\n",
      "accessories,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "What about your casual wear?\n",
      "Do you like to wear jeans most of the time?\n",
      "Um, yeah\n",
      "mostly.\n",
      "I mean, at home I predominantly wear laughs while saying remainder of sweatpants and things like that, also.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's nice you can wear shorts, especially on a day like today when it's so hot.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, they're, um, you know, they're like\n",
      "Dress shorts.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "they're like black corduroy Bermuda shorts.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And sometimes I wear a blazer with them,\n",
      "and I get really a lot of compliments on them.\n",
      "Um, where I work is predominantly male.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, you know, they,\n",
      "their attire is always the same, you know. Suits or slacks, you know, jeans, whatever.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but ,\n",
      "And, um, but I'm really the only woman, I guess, at work that does that,\n",
      "but seems to work for me\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but .\n",
      "In fact, I just bought, I, I just got a new outfit as a gift that, um,\n",
      "it's one of those skorts,\n",
      "you know,\n",
      "it's shorts but it looks like a skirt.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, I think that'll be good for work, too.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "It'll be comfortable.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "I guess down here, uh,\n",
      "we just recently moved to Texas,\n",
      "so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, we moved from Colorado where,\n",
      "and I have a closet full of sweaters.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That,\n",
      "Well, see, I live in Virginia.\n",
      "You live in Virginia, now?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, that's interesting.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, I'm,\n",
      "you know, like right now, today was in about, you know, the fifties.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, um, you know, I, I do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'd like to be able to wear those here.\n",
      "Today it's eighty-eight degrees.\n",
      "Oh, my\n",
      "So\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Needless to say, my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Today was, uh, definitely a shorts day around here.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we're still pretty much, you know, in winter, as far as that goes here.\n",
      "This is pretty unseasonal,\n",
      "but, uh, at least, we,\n",
      "you know, it, it, it feels good,\n",
      "it gets, uh,\n",
      "everybody doesn't have cabin fever today.\n",
      "It's nice to get, out and about.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I guess we've discussed everything there is about clothing\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Sounds good.\n",
      "Okay?\n",
      "It was nice talking to you.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "it was nice talking to you, also.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Hi,\n",
      "um, okay\n",
      "what, now, uh, what particularly, particularly what kind of music do you like?\n",
      "Well, I mostly listen to popular music.\n",
      "I, uh, listen to it all the time in, in my car,\n",
      "so, I, I tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because I don't like commercials.\n",
      "But, uh, I find myself listening to popular music,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and, uh, quite honestly, I, I have some little children\n",
      "and I, unfortunately, found myself listening to a lot of nursery rhyme music here lately,\n",
      "but that's not by my choice.\n",
      "Oh, really.\n",
      "I just got my catalog this morning and was looking through it.\n",
      "Oh, with the Santa Claus on the cover.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I've already ordered from that one,\n",
      "but we will probably be going up at Thanksgiving this year,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Oh, do you live, where do you,\n",
      "what state are you in?\n",
      "Texas.\n",
      "Oh, you're in Texas.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I'm in the Dallas area. In Plano.\n",
      "So am I.\n",
      "I'm in Garland.\n",
      "Uh so that's not too far.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I talked to somebody from Wisconsin or something the other day.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "so I guess they get people from all over.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "driving for Thanksgiving, that's going to be quite a drive for,\n",
      "Well it was when we left last year.\n",
      "We left on the eighteenth, right before that big snow storm hit Colorado\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and we pulled in just as it hit.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "So, how do you go?\n",
      "Do you go up through the Raton Pass, when you go up there?\n",
      "Uh, no,\n",
      "oh,\n",
      "well, wait a minute,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "we do,\n",
      "we do.\n",
      "That's on like Route two eighty-seven or something like that.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh-huh,\n",
      "and then we go straight up through Trinidad and straight up I Twenty-five from there.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "we, uh, went a different way when we went last Christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little U Haul trailer,\n",
      "because we had to take our dog in the car, there was no room for luggage.\n",
      "So, we went all interstate.\n",
      "We went up, um, through Oklahoma City and then up through, uh, Kansas, and then turned left and went in on I Seventy\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "and it wound up only taking us about an extra hour.\n",
      "It was a little more mile wise\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but because you could go sixty-five miles an hour on the,\n",
      "All set.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Actually I'm in Plano, too\n",
      "That's okay.\n",
      "I say Dallas area when I'm talking to people elsewhere.\n",
      "That's okay,\n",
      "it's more, uh, concentrated, so they know where you are.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, anyway, I know here in, here in Plano some of the things that we do are, um, Kroger\n",
      "and some of the other stores, too, have said, If you bring your bags back to, to the store to recycle, then they'll pay you a certain amount of money,\n",
      "and that's one thing that started in the community.\n",
      "They actually pay you money for that?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, um, Brookshires up in uh, Allen, uh, you bring your bags back, you know, they, uh, the plastic bags back or the paper bags, you put them in the receptacles there,\n",
      "but I didn't realize some people are actually paying you for that. Um.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I know Kroger will do it,\n",
      "and I think Albertson's does it sometimes,\n",
      "I'm not sure.\n",
      "Um, and, and yet, I know that, uh, some of the stores will actually help the community, not pay you the money back, but will pay the, the, uh, community, like through the schools or things like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Interesting.\n",
      "So, um, that's always helpful,\n",
      "and I know that we we have the, the can, the can, different can banks around the city that you can go to and do that.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Um, one of the ways,\n",
      "I don't know, uh, if this would be helpful.\n",
      "It said on the, the computer, what do I think would be helpful.\n",
      "And I don't know if it would be helpful or not,\n",
      "but I know on Monday, the, the garbage men pick up like just, um, any limbs or any extra trash that you might have,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And that might be an extra day to put out things that might be recycled if we had a, a certain colored can to put them in or something in the city to put, like either glass or newspapers or whatever.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I think they already do that out East.\n",
      "Um, they have to, it's a little bit more difficult, because people have to remember, Okay, today's glass okay tomorrow's plastic, and all that\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but I think that's the way we need to go.\n",
      "It's, uh, it's pretty bad.\n",
      "All these years we've\n",
      "been, especially in this country, all the, uh, the plastic and the paper and everything, we just used to throw out.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh, I know getting a newspaper everyday, I know I could just, you know, do that because I have to pick it up,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it just goes out with our trash,\n",
      "and I guess I'm not as, um, recycling minded as I should be\n",
      "but that goes out with the trash,\n",
      "and it really could be recycled.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "about six months ago I started\n",
      "Did you?\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "and, uh so what I do is, uh,\n",
      "Tell me.\n",
      "it's not bad,\n",
      "you just have to have a place to keep everything,\n",
      "but, uh, it, you'll be amazed if you ever start doing it.\n",
      "Just put your paper in the same place every day,\n",
      "and it'll start stacking up.\n",
      "Take your glass, um, you know, pickle jars, or, or whatever, uh, liquid jars, you know,\n",
      "just rinse them out a little bit\n",
      "and put them all in a place,\n",
      "and, uh plastics,\n",
      "Don't you have to take like labels off of those jars?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "from what I understand, uh, you can leave the labels on, um, although I rip, rip them off.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I don't, I don't scrub them or anything,\n",
      "I just tear them off\n",
      "Take them off,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "throw the lids and everything out,\n",
      "but, uh, put all the glass in one place, and plastics, like milk jugs, uh, orange juice jugs, things like that.\n",
      "Soda,\n",
      "both liter sodas\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "can you do that.\n",
      "those also.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Um, and then, of course, uh, cans, coke cans, whatever.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "But, uh, I haven't been down to the recycling center yet to find out exactly what they need or what they take, and all that,\n",
      "I've just read a lot about it,\n",
      "and I'm keeping these big piles of it right now\n",
      "I going to try to dump it out this weekend in fact.\n",
      "But, uh, you'd be amazed how quickly it all stacks up.\n",
      "There's a lot that we throw out.\n",
      "I, I know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just, um, get it into different categories like that,\n",
      "and I, I don't know what it would take to, to get my children to start working on it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I have two older ones that probably would go along with the, if I had it arranged so that it wasn't a big project, you know.\n",
      "It's, yeah, it's not a big deal.\n",
      "You get used to it.\n",
      "One,\n",
      "let me tell you one interesting thing\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "when I went back to the store, and I said, Hey, um, I understand you all are taking these bags back, uh, you know, what do you do with them.\n",
      "And they told me, they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong there and then, you know, go and recycle the rest.\n",
      "And I said, What do you mean the ones that don't belong there?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And they said, Well, people come in and put anything in the receptacles.\n",
      "And what I found out is, if you look at the bottom of those bags, Kroger or whatever the plastic ones, they've got numbers on them.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and if it's got the little recycle symbol and inside it it's got a number, like bags from Drug Emporium have a ...\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "Hello,\n",
      "Hello,\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Boy\n",
      "it took forever to find somebody.\n",
      "Oh, well I'm glad you found me.\n",
      "Good,\n",
      "well I'm, my name's Gail,\n",
      "and I guess we have to, talk about credit cards.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "My name is Carolyn.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "well, if you're ready, then uh,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I'll just let you start,\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "I'll press one\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "well, I'm not,\n",
      "this is kind of an interesting subject to come up for me, because credit cards are my downfall.\n",
      "I just find it so easy to, to charge something when I don't have the money to pay for it,\n",
      "and I'm really trying to get out of that habit.\n",
      "So. I think they're kind of dangerous.\n",
      "I think they are, too.\n",
      "And, unfortunately, um, we use ours in, we don't use them all the time,\n",
      "but we use them like at Christmas time,\n",
      "and then it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them like that\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, um, I would love to just take some scissors and cut them in half.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "me too.\n",
      "I think sometimes when you look at the interest that you're paying on them, um, that's what gets to be the really scary part, you know, if you think, when it comes around to income tax time, and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year,\n",
      "you could really get a lot more stuff if you were just able to pay outright for it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's true,\n",
      "that's true.\n",
      "Seems just like our society is so, um, pushes so hard for, you can have it, you know, and then no interest, no payments for a year, and stuff like this,\n",
      "they're really trying to get you into that situation, because they know they've really got you then,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "all I know is some of my credit cards,\n",
      "like, um, we have a Sears one,\n",
      "and we always get a maintenance agreement every year\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it's just easier to say, you know, just put that on my credit card.\n",
      "Well that's probably four or five hundred dollars, you know, that goes on at that point\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and then it seems like takes forever to pay that off.\n",
      "It's funny, that we've got a Sears card, and we bought a washer and dryer on it, four years ago, and we still owe.\n",
      "I mean, I, I think like half the amount that they cost in the first place.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "It's just, uh, you know, you never, never get it out,\n",
      "and now that's real irritating.\n",
      "It sure is.\n",
      "We eventually did,\n",
      "one time we just borrowed, took a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards,\n",
      "and the interest on the loan was cheaper than it was, you know, to just have that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "We haven't done it lately.\n",
      "We probably need to do it again.\n",
      "Well, we did, you know,\n",
      "one time, we wanted to buy a truck, a used truck,\n",
      "and so we went down to the bank,\n",
      "and they said, Sure we'll give you a personal loan.\n",
      "It was only a thousand dollars that we needed for the truck.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And they said, sure that's no problem, but, you know, why don't we consolidate your bills,\n",
      "and at the time we thought, Oh, that would be great, you know, we could,\n",
      "and it's going to be a lower payment than it was for all of them,\n",
      "you only have to write one check a month, not all those.\n",
      "You never miss one or whatever\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and we did that,\n",
      "but we didn't realize at the time, until several months later, that we, we were real,\n",
      "I mean this was four three years ago,\n",
      "we were pretty young\n",
      "and we were just kind of like,\n",
      "well, I guess that means these credit cards are closed,\n",
      "and we didn't, you know,\n",
      "about six months later we realized we could use them,\n",
      "and so we charged them all up again.\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before, but also adding the lower payment for all of them,\n",
      "So we were paying like twice.\n",
      "Um, so we didn't ever make that mistake again, luckily\n",
      "But, uh, we're definitely working on not doing that credit thing.\n",
      "We just,\n",
      "as a matter of fact, this, it's real interesting the subjects I get.\n",
      "They always seem to be so pertinent.\n",
      "But we just discussed this last night at church, talking about debt and things like that.\n",
      "It's so, so alluring, and uh, so easy to get,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "uh, sometimes,\n",
      "I know,\n",
      "they really encourage you not to go into debt for anything except for maybe your house and your car.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "And, uh, if you could stick to that, you know, we'd get rid of a lot of indigestion and everything else.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "Oh, I just picked up my daughter\n",
      "and she was eating a cupcake and now her crumbs all over.\n",
      "Oh, dear.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "What a mess you are.\n",
      "Oh, so I don't know, if I, if I, I just feel kind of.\n",
      "My big thing was my husband really wanted to get rid of our Visa card,\n",
      "and I just thought, you know, if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something, you know and we had to, had to buy one, then we would really need that,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and so he said, Okay we'll keep it,\n",
      "and then we weren't smart enough to not use it,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "You know, one thing you might do with, in a situation like that, though, it's just like keep,\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "so you're into microwave cooking.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's just, it's so easy nowadays, you know,\n",
      "and it's, uh, especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave\n",
      "and it be ready in just a few minutes\n",
      ", yes,\n",
      "and that's what we all are looking for, isn't it,\n",
      "something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I've gotten in the habit of cooking something big on the weekends so that I have leftovers all week.\n",
      "All week.\n",
      "Well, we've done that, too.\n",
      "There's just my husband and I,\n",
      "and he, he sometimes makes a huge spot uh, pot of spaghetti\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, you know, we're eating it for a week and a half,\n",
      "and I kind of get sick of it after he\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "I try not to make too much.\n",
      "It's just my husband and I, too\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I try not to make so much that it lasts more than that week\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "but, uh, I usually, I usually like to make spaghetti or soup or chili or, you know, something like that or sometimes a roast,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "but,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "What's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party?\n",
      "Um, I have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas\n",
      "Oh, oh.\n",
      "it's, it's really good,\n",
      "I got it from a friend of mine that I used to work with\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, every time I've served it, everybody just loves it.\n",
      "Ooh,\n",
      "that sounds delicious.\n",
      "So that's, that's one of my favorite things to make.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "What about you?\n",
      "I end up with an old stand-by that we call Russian chicken, because it's so easy\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, it\n",
      "you have to cook very little to go with it, just some rice and some salad\n",
      "and that's about it, you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, what do you put in it?\n",
      "Uh, you make, you just take your boneless chicken breasts\n",
      "and then you take and make a, a dressing out of, uh, Russian dressing, one bottle of that and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix and three ounces of apricot preserves\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Ooh,\n",
      "that sounds good.\n",
      "and you mix it up,\n",
      "and you just put it on the top of the chicken,\n",
      "and then I cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and then I take the foil off and let it brown takes about another twenty minutes\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it's delicious\n",
      "Ooh,\n",
      "that sounds good.\n",
      "and it's so simple, because I can pop it in when I come in the door, you know, and then, uh, go about my business,\n",
      "and by the time I've got everything else ready, the chicken's chicken's done.\n",
      "Is done,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "So that's a real easy thing for me.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that sounds good, too.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I've got a, um, a great recipe for cheese cake.\n",
      "Oh, really.\n",
      "I don't know if you get SOUTHERN LIVING,\n",
      "but\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I don't,\n",
      "my mom gets that,\n",
      "but,\n",
      "they have one,\n",
      "if you like to cook, they have,\n",
      "every recipe I've tried out of that has been a really good one\n",
      "Really.\n",
      "and, um, you know, every month they've got all different kinds of recipes,\n",
      "but, I got one in there about a year or so ago on cheese cake,\n",
      "and it's just a regular cheese cake,\n",
      "and then you can put raspberry, uh, topping on it\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but inside the cheese cake, uh, recipe you put, um, lemon peel and orange peel\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "and it's just enough to taste it, you know, when, when, when you're eating the cheese cake,\n",
      "and it is wonderful,\n",
      "but it takes a long time, because you have to cook it for forty-five minutes, and then you turn the oven off, and you leave it in the oven for another forty-five minutes and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for another forty-five minutes and then you're supposed to, um, I think, chill it to room temperature\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Oh, my goodness.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so sometimes I'll do that overnight, and then put the topping on the next day,\n",
      "but it's, it's very good.\n",
      "Well, I love cheese cake.\n",
      "I have never been, I don't know, the ones\n",
      "I have made I have not done that well with.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I like a baked cheese cake, you know,\n",
      "I don't,\n",
      "I have had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff and refrigerate it, you know\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but that's not the same as a, a New York style cheese cake.\n",
      "No\n",
      "it's not.\n",
      "And, uh, the recipes that I've used,\n",
      "everybody will say, Oh, this is real simple,\n",
      "and then I make it,\n",
      "and it's, it's really not very good\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "but yours sounds good.\n",
      "I bet that lemon and orange peel gives it a little bit of tartness.\n",
      "It does,\n",
      "and it, it, it is really good.\n",
      "Um. Well, that sounds interesting,\n",
      "so there's your good dessert for your dinner party.\n",
      "Right\n",
      "Are you into serving wines with your dinner party?\n",
      "Oh, sometimes,\n",
      "but I mean, I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means.\n",
      "Me, either.\n",
      "I wish I knew more about it.\n",
      "I've been to, you know, some wine tastings up in Napa Valley\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, um, you know, and I learned a little bit about them then,\n",
      "but you know what would be fun, they have some of those classes you can take\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "They would be, if you just had time to do it.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "and then there's places, um,\n",
      "do you live in Dallas\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "okay,\n",
      "there's places here that, um, offer,\n",
      "I think it's like once a month,\n",
      "you can go and, to a particular restaurant or whatever,\n",
      "and you can kind of take a cooking class\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and then you get to eat everything afterwards,\n",
      "and then they also go into the wines, you know to serve with, you know, different types of of meals and that kind of thing,\n",
      "Well, how neat.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it sounds like it's a lot of fun.\n",
      "We have some friends who've done that,\n",
      "and they've really enjoyed it.\n",
      "Um, well, I didn't even know they were offering that.\n",
      "I guess I,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "this place is called like Medina's or Messina's Kitchen or something like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, well, I bet that would be a fun thing to do.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it, it sounds like, like it,\n",
      "Jay, um,\n",
      "my kids are, are both in college, um,\n",
      "and I'd, I played a fairly active part in helping them decide where to go.\n",
      "On the other hand, they really decided themselves.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, what, what kind of experience did you have?\n",
      "Well, I, uh,\n",
      "one girl went in, in state and has graduated,\n",
      "and then, uh, that was, uh, you know, that was her choice pretty much where she wanted to go\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I have, uh, one, out of, two out of state, both in Missouri,\n",
      "and, um, I teach, uh, in a college,\n",
      "and so I they had heard me talk about it, and for years, that I didn't think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate.\n",
      "Uh, so, that was pretty much, uh.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "I see,\n",
      "well, I, may, maybe I'm wrong,\n",
      "but I think it makes a big difference in terms of finding a school that is sort of right for the child in terms of his or her happiness and, and, and the appropriate support environment and things like that.\n",
      "Oh, oh, if they, if they're content there,\n",
      "I mean as far as the education, as far as looking at the degree at the end, that, uh, it's very little difference is paid to it, where you get that bachelor's.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, if it's a halfway decent school they should be happy naturally,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and if they can get, uh, um, two out of,\n",
      "let's see, my son got a full total scholarships\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and so there's, uh, there's plenty of scholarships out there,\n",
      "and so people should be advised to look for those,\n",
      "and, um,\n",
      "Did, did you play a, a strong role in helping them pick schools\n",
      "or did you just sort of say listen to your guidance counselors\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Well, they, uh,\n",
      "I went, we went around,\n",
      "my son was a, graduated from a Jesuit high school\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and so he, he was pretty much looking for a Jesuit university,\n",
      "and so there you know,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "that was limited to five or six different places\n",
      "and, um, so he's in Saint Louis U,\n",
      "and I guess I played a role in that.\n",
      "I, I just sort of, uh, let them, um, you know,\n",
      "they'd all been, uh pretty efficient as far as studies\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and, uh, so I didn't have that much to do,\n",
      "they just, uh they just knew they wanted to go to college,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and I, you know, helped them get there as far as traveling with them to look at different places.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We did do that,\n",
      "and I would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I think that's a great idea,\n",
      "I mean, that,\n",
      "Some people don't do it,\n",
      "and then they get there and hate it, or whatever,\n",
      "so if it's possible.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "It's, it seemed expensive at the time you're doing it, but, but the compared to the, the total decision it's nothing.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I think in the short run it is expensive.\n",
      "In the long run it's very, uh, reasonable if the person,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "my daughter has been in, in Missouri for a second year,\n",
      "now she's coming home at the end of the semester\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so, uh, you know, she's already twenty-one.\n",
      "She started late.\n",
      "So that's, you know, strictly up to her,\n",
      "and, uh, she'll finish down here, uh, uh, finish this year down here and then decide what she's going to do next year.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It'll save me a lot of money because I'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but again, that's her decision\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "so, uh, but I have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back,\n",
      "and they're much better students at twenty-five, twenty-six, may, twenty-eight.\n",
      "So, you know, I don't, I never have pushed them.\n",
      "I just say that education is important, you should do it, uh,\n",
      "but, uh, they have to do the work\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "so, uh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, back, back to this visiting thing,\n",
      "I mean, I found that my kids had no conception what college was really like and, and that the process of going around to a few schools with them really helped them understand\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and being able to go with them to at least some of them gave me a chance to explain things to them and to, uh, in reference to what we had seen.\n",
      "Oh, I think so.\n",
      "And also I'm opposed to the, to the size.\n",
      "They've just gotten so huge,\n",
      "and so my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand,\n",
      "see that's just too many.\n",
      "Good grief\n",
      "Ended up going to where I used to go,\n",
      "and that was twenty-five hundred when I went there,\n",
      "it's twenty-one thousand, now\n",
      "it's too big.\n",
      "Good grief.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "What is twenty-one thousand?\n",
      "Pardon?\n",
      "What school is that?\n",
      "It's Southwest Missouri State University\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, it was twenty-five hundred when I went there forty years ago,\n",
      "and, uh, my son's in a school about seven thousand,\n",
      "and that's, that's not bad\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I teach in a school about eight thousand,\n",
      "and that's, that's even a little large\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "but it's much better than twenty-one thousand.\n",
      "But they do have to visit, and if, if the parent can point out all the different places to look for for scholarships,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and then, oh, those rating, uh,\n",
      "the magazines and all those things are doing the ratings now and everything,\n",
      "I don't think it hurts to look at them\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I don't put that much stock in them,\n",
      "but\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "probably fine just to compare.\n",
      "Helps to at least set up range of things to look at.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "If they, you know, uh, they need to,\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "who do you like?\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "What kind do I like?\n",
      "I like just about any kind except country and western.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's the same with me, same with me.\n",
      "It's, it's, course country\n",
      "and western even I've gotten a little bit used to because it's not like it used to be.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Like Clint Black, he's pretty good,\n",
      "and who's the other big guy?\n",
      "Well, in Oklahoma we say Garth Brooks\n",
      "Garth Brooks,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "that's, yeah, that's the other guy I was thinking of was Garth Brooks.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "in fact I think both of them have performed here.\n",
      "And Kenny Rogers, he's kind of country western verge, you know on the verge of country western.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Of course, Garth Brooks lives about, uh, you know,\n",
      "his, his home town is about, uh, fifteen minutes away\n",
      "Oh, wonderful.\n",
      "so he is, he's a home boy\n",
      "Well, then, of course you like him.\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "But, well, I have teen age children,\n",
      "and so, you know, I'm, hear the, the rock music, not the hard rock, but the, you know, Michael Bolton type stuff.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "He's my personal favorite.\n",
      "My son is, uh, twenty-eight,\n",
      "so, but he, he's real unusual in that, uh,\n",
      "he likes a little bit of every kind.\n",
      "He likes jazz and, uh, blues and, and course the rock\n",
      "Oh, that's good.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "I, I can't say he's real crazy about elevator music, as he calls it.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "no,\n",
      "I, I don't, I don't, actually, we don't listen to any elevator music at my house.\n",
      "But I've got teenagers,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Well, my teenagers are all gone.\n",
      "I can listen to any music I want to\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's good,\n",
      "I, actually, when I'm home alone, which isn't too often, but, uh, our Public Radio Station has wonderful classical music.\n",
      "It's just very wonderful. Soothing, and, you know, uh, lot of symphonies\n",
      "and, I just, I love that,\n",
      "that's probably my all-time favorite.\n",
      "You know, uh, I, I teach\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "and we can have music in the classroom,\n",
      "but it, you know, it can't be the rock or anything like that\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and I, I find that the classical music is very good for the kids too, it doesn't disturb them and yet it's, it's, it stimulates them,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Relax,\n",
      "and and, uh,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "What do you teach, what grade?\n",
      "Well, it's ninth, nine through twelve\n",
      "Good for you.\n",
      "and,\n",
      "A certain subject?\n",
      "Well, it's, uh, business technology.\n",
      "Good for you.\n",
      "But, uh\n",
      "I was just sitting here while she was trying to find, a, a, another caller, uh,\n",
      "I was reading\n",
      "my, my husband and I are taking a computer class at our junior college\n",
      "oh, boy,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's pretty good,\n",
      "it's just a real basic class,\n",
      "but we're learning a lot,\n",
      "and we have a home computer,\n",
      "so it's, it's very interesting.\n",
      "Uh, yeah,\n",
      "I'd learn it too.\n",
      "Uh, back to, I guess we'd better get back to music, though.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "the subject of music\n",
      "I, uh,\n",
      "do you play any instruments?\n",
      "I play, I play piano,\n",
      "I took lessons for thirteen years,\n",
      "and right now my nine year old is taking piano,\n",
      "and I just got a whole mess of music,\n",
      "I, I play the, volunteer to play the piano at the children's Christmas program for the whole grade school, which is K through six five hundred kids.\n",
      "Ooh, you took on a,\n",
      "good job.\n",
      "I did it last year,\n",
      "and, and, um, I, I just sub at the school,\n",
      "I don't want to work full time,\n",
      "so I just sub at the school,\n",
      "and that's kind of my volunteer thing,\n",
      "so that, it, it's really neat,\n",
      "and my older daughter plays the saxophone,\n",
      "my next son plays the drums,\n",
      "and my third son just started baritone this year,\n",
      "and my little girl will start French horn next year,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Oh, well, my son played the sax and drums, my daughter the piano, organ and French horn.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "French horn is absolutely wonderful instrument.\n",
      "It's just my favorite.\n",
      "Of course that's what I played,\n",
      "and so I'm pushing that on my daughter because I want to play in our city band, not the symphony, with just the city band once we get the, the French horn\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "and I get a little bit more time.\n",
      "Right now I'm busy chasing my kids.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "sounds like you've got a houseful.\n",
      "I do, I do, I love it,\n",
      "but we have a, a marvelous band instructor,\n",
      "and, and he's just, he's wonderful.\n",
      "We have, uh, couple of hundred kids in the band,\n",
      "our junior high band is just wonderful.\n",
      "Oh, that's a,\n",
      "He, lot,\n",
      "and their concert band,\n",
      "and then he has a jazz band that my older daughter was in,\n",
      "and my son will be in next year\n",
      "that's,\n",
      "I mean, they play college level music in junior high,\n",
      "he's that good of an instructor,\n",
      "and the kids just love him.\n",
      "Oh, that's wonderful,\n",
      "So it's really good.\n",
      "It is wonderful.\n",
      "I, I have totally, totally a tin ear\n",
      "Oh do you\n",
      "and I love music.\n",
      "I cannot carry a tune in a basket.\n",
      "I know what I like,\n",
      "but I\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "you know, and I love to listen to it, love to sing, and I, my kids, when I was little and, they were little\n",
      "and I was rocking them, singing to them.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, I guess, uh, this is a, a topic near and dear to my heart, since I am a, am a healthy eater,\n",
      "Well, I, I try to be as well,\n",
      "Well, I'm not, uh, I,\n",
      "there really isn't any kind of particular food that I, I don't, don't like really,\n",
      "and I like a good Italian restaurant or a good, uh, uh,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "especially like good prime rib\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so if it's, uh, nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that,\n",
      "and I live here in, uh, Rome, New York,\n",
      "and there are a lot of good restaurants around here.\n",
      "Oh, you're in New York,\n",
      "I was going to,\n",
      "there's a place, if you ever make it to Dallas they have the best prime rib.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's called Lawry's, like Lawry's seasoning salt\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it is absolutely wonderful.\n",
      "Really.\n",
      "And, uh, we were there a few months ago,\n",
      "and it, I mean, it's kind of pricey,\n",
      "well, from New York it probably doesn't matter,\n",
      "but\n",
      "Oh, no,\n",
      "I'm in upstate New York,\n",
      "and it's actually very inexpensive,\n",
      "I,\n",
      "there's a there's a place, um, half a mile from me here that, uh, has, uh, fantastic prime rib for, oh, eleven dollars for a whole meal, you know a potato and salad and soup, and the whole, whole nine yards,\n",
      "Oh, is it, okay.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so that,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, I think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen,\n",
      "and it includes, you know, salad and rolls and, oh, some other stuff,\n",
      "but it is absolutely wonderful.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "It's the best I have ever had.\n",
      "Uh, I was going to this place up the street from me is the best I've ever had,\n",
      "so, I'll have to go there when I get to get to Dallas.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Well,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, we like, uh, lots of people down here like Mexican food\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "sure.\n",
      "so, um, that's,\n",
      "I, I think Italian and Mexican food are probably my favorites.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, um, I'm not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "no,\n",
      "I'm not into the, the, don't do the, the raw, raw fish like that,\n",
      "but I do like, uh, like a seafood bar, like a raw, raw bar like oysters and things like that, uh\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "that they, uh,\n",
      "I go on,\n",
      "I'm an officer in the Air Force and travel quite a bit on business\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "so I, uh, find myself down in Melbourne, Florida about once, once a month, once every two months or so and, uh, go and hit the, the oyster bars down there quite a bit\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, yeah\n",
      "but, I love that,\n",
      "fresh seafood down there,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and, um, and, uh, Maryland's great,\n",
      "you get the crabs\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "it's like, I can't go anywhere where I where I don't enjoy myself,\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "seafood seems to be a a little bit more expensive than, than other types of food.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "But it sure is good,\n",
      "and it's supposed to be good for you.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, uh, it's really strange that, that, that seafood is so expensive, because when you, in reality, uh, uh, I, say that, uh, the oceans have the greatest resource of food on the planet,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and yet, we haven't, as human beings, haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "so, we managed to, uh, figure out how to get at just about everything else, but, uh, but not, uh, not seafood.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Do you like spicy foods\n",
      "or,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I like, uh, I make a, a wicked chili\n",
      "and around here the big spicy thing is like, uh, buffalo wings\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "and so, uh, it, people, they, you know,\n",
      "you go out to get the chicken wings\n",
      "and those are really hot and the hotter the better,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, we, uh, we like spicy food down here, especially, uh, the hot sauce, Picante sauce, or salsa whatever you all call it\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "and, uh, we, we sure go through a lot of that\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But I like it hot,\n",
      "but I don't like it real hot because then my nose starts running\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "My, generally my, my scalp will start,\n",
      "I can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot, the weirdest, weirdest sensation, almost like a tingling,\n",
      "but, uh, I don't know,\n",
      "but, uh,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "well, there isn't, isn't too much in the way of restaurants that I don't like.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Things that are kind of oddball, like, uh, Thai cuisine,\n",
      "I never been really fond of that stuff.\n",
      "You talk about spicy,\n",
      "that'll, that'll literally blow your head off,\n",
      "it's so hot.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, and I can handle just about any kind of food without, uh, um,\n",
      "well, but that, that stuff is, goes one notch beyond, uh, my tolerances,\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "So. Although I guess on this topic are to talk about the, uh, service in a restaurant is always nice though, too\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "that's one thing,\n",
      "and the price.  And the price. Make you want to come back.\n",
      "What's that?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "Well, I find that lately that so many people are working, you know, working waitressing jobs or waiter,\n",
      "Go ahead.\n",
      "Um, I haven't given this a, a lot of thought.\n",
      "I'm, uh, that, that's a whole, pleased with the practice that is they,\n",
      "I, uh, I don't,\n",
      "you would favor invasions of privacy on the other hand that's arguable but that, that, uh, people who's jobs are critical to public safety should have to meet special standards.\n",
      "Uh, I haven't given this matter enough thought.\n",
      "Do you work for T I?\n",
      "No, uh,\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "I'm in the Washington area.\n",
      "I work for N I S T .\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Oh, all right.\n",
      "Well, see we have the testing already here.\n",
      "We've had it for, oh, about five years.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It used to just be for new employees.\n",
      "And now  it's for all employees.\n",
      "And now,\n",
      "They, uh, randomly select employee numbers\n",
      "and, uh, the day that they select you is when you have to go and, and be tested.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "and how do people feel about it?\n",
      "So, we're familiar with it.\n",
      "Oh, we have a lot of, um, people upset about it at the beginning. Some not all.\n",
      "But what was happening at T I is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse. Um, mainly the areas where they were doing a lot of, um, manufacturing type things\n",
      "and what they ended up doing is, uh, kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening,\n",
      "and we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing, you know, on the premises.\n",
      "Well, okay,\n",
      "that's, that's a very different issue.\n",
      "Well, yeah,\n",
      "it was, you know, combination of, of, uh, both activities and, uh, and using too\n",
      "so they developed this, uh, drug policy so that, uh, to eliminate,\n",
      "there's some parts of the company that we do, uh, government contracts,\n",
      "and I think some of those require the drug testing,\n",
      "but now T I thought well, we'll just do it for all employees that, um, not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in\n",
      "and that we shouldn't have, um, people on drugs within our, you know, offices and such.\n",
      "And,\n",
      "I haven't personally ever been tested,\n",
      "but I don't have a problem with it.\n",
      "Um, does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "but one thing that to, to me was, um, going on, stretching it a little too far was that they also check, um, if you are taking somebody else's prescription drug.\n",
      "You know, it happens a lot of times\n",
      "like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever\n",
      "and, you know  then they give it to everybody else in the family and don't always go back to the, you know, doctor and get another prescription.\n",
      "Well ,\n",
      "Well, according to what they do at T I, if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name.\n",
      "It, you know, it can't be in your spouse's name\n",
      "so they will look, I mean, the testing will look for, I guess, any kind of drugs,\n",
      "and you have to tell them what they are taking a prescription for.\n",
      "So they ask you to declare beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking?\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "When you get tested you are supposed to tell them, you know, everything that, that might be there.\n",
      "And then if they ever, um, question you or something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, it, I mean, it's, I guess that, in fact, they don't test for, for, they don't routinely test for very many prescription drugs\n",
      "but that I, but they don't say in advance , uh,\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Well, what they be testing for are the ones that would have like, you know, barbiturates or codeine things like that in them.\n",
      "The ones that would kind of constitute controlled substances or something anyway .\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "I guess that's what they wouldn't be looking for penicillin and antibiotics and stuff.\n",
      "They would be looking for the, yeah, controlled things, barbiturates amphetamines.\n",
      "So what they are asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs you are taking which are controlled substances.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "You pretty much, you know, put down what you remember even if it was just Contact or something like that.\n",
      "But afterwards, uh, maybe if you had a controlled substance  Well,\n",
      "Is Contact a,\n",
      "you, you probably put down, you know, you had Drixoral or Contact if you would remember that you did it.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Is Contact a,  substance?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "I'm,  just saying you probably put down on the sheet  anything you have taken.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "But if they had a controlled substance, maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name.\n",
      "I know I had one contract employee through Manpower was not a T I person, but was a contract person,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they test them too even if you are not a real, uh, T I\n",
      "If you are a contract employee here  they test you too.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And he had taken some kind of, um, oh, you know, uh,\n",
      "just, he had some kind of flu or something.\n",
      "He got a real bad migraine\n",
      "and he took his mother's,\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "What is your favorite show?\n",
      "Well, I was just trying to think.\n",
      "When they called, I didn't have as much time to prepare for this as I did some of the others.\n",
      "Um, I love watching some of the, uh, new, new shows basically.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And we, uh, we subscribe to C N N\n",
      "and we took that,\n",
      "and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake,\n",
      "and I have gotten stuck on a lot of this.\n",
      "The new shows and the stuff that comes on that, that it, you know,\n",
      "like the, uh, at night the discussion talk shows and things.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current, uh, especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "We have little ones.\n",
      "Uh, we do let them watch NINE ONE ONE,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and we think that's kind of informative to teach them,  how to handle things in situations.\n",
      "It really is.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "What do you watch?\n",
      "I watch just about anything,  but not a lot of,  T V.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I mean I'll watch, you know, maybe a little while when I first get home in the evening.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I usually watch, you know, the news\n",
      "and then I'll watch that HARD COPY or or that kind of thing, you know,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That's the same thing we do.\n",
      "and I like the NINE ONE ONE,  and UNSOLVED MYSTERIES.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that kind, that's the kind I like really more than,  the sitcoms.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I haven't gotten,  into many of those.\n",
      "Now, I do,  like,\n",
      "my husband is really crazy about EVENING SHADE that comes on, on Monday evening.\n",
      "I have heard that's real good.\n",
      "And I,  uh,\n",
      "That's,  Burt Reynolds, isn't it?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I've heard that.\n",
      "And I've got to where every Monday I rush around so I could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny.\n",
      "Now someone told me that\n",
      "and also, uh, I meant to be trying to pick up on MURPHY BROWN,  because they said that that was really good this season.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, his favorite night is Monday night\n",
      "so we've got to where we will sit,  and watch it on Monday night,\n",
      "You've got to yeah,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "because that and then that, uh, oh,\n",
      "I can't even think of the name of it.\n",
      "Like I say I'm not,\n",
      "DESIGNING WOMEN is on that night,  too.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and the one with the, the sergeant that married the woman with the kids, Sergeant McGillis .\n",
      "Huh, I don't even know.\n",
      "Sergeant, uh, MAJOR DAD.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Now I,  we've never even seen that.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that comes on right after, uh, the EVENING SHADE and then MURPHY BROWN,  and DESIGNING WOMEN.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So we always, he watches that\n",
      "and I kind of I watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others,  as I can.\n",
      "On the others.\n",
      "Well, you know, on Friday nights especially, we like to watch TWENTY TWENTY.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Or, um,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's kind of a competition on Thursdays between PRIME TIME and KNOTS LANDING.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But, uh, we used to like KNOTS LANDING a lot.\n",
      "Oh, excuse me just a minute to someone in the\n",
      "The money is right there on the thing and the coupon.\n",
      "Well, you can't hardly watch KNOTS LANDING with the little kids around though.\n",
      "Oh, I know.\n",
      "That's the thing.\n",
      "And so,  we,\n",
      "Except they,   probably are in bed,  by nine.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, they are.\n",
      "In fact, on weeknights they are in bed by eight,\n",
      "but we have just gotten any more that where we just keep it off.\n",
      "Did you get your pizza taken care of?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "he has gone to get it.\n",
      "Thank you\n",
      "Um, but I was to say on Saturdays there is absolutely nothing\n",
      "and that's the day my husband,  wants to .\n",
      "Well, do you know,\n",
      "I have picked up a show lately on Saturday night that I've really liked\n",
      "and that's SISTERS.\n",
      "Have you watched that?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "but I saw that advertised today\n",
      "and it sounds like it's not fluff.\n",
      "It sounds like it's good.\n",
      "It's really, you know, it's really pretty good.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I mean, it's kind of like, you know, um, soap opera I guess.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's what they said it was kind of,  a little more drama to it.\n",
      "But it's a,\n",
      "So far it, I've watched it about three times now\n",
      "and it's really held my attention.\n",
      "It's been pretty good. Some,  pretty good acting.\n",
      "Well, and  and another one now that it's getting darker\n",
      "and you are wanting to cocoon more,\n",
      "that they said is excellent is the I'LL FLY AWAY and BROOKLYN BRIDGE.\n",
      "Some of these,  that are nostalgic.\n",
      "Now I watched,  BROOKLYN BRIDGE this week for the first time,\n",
      "Did you,  like it?\n",
      "but I haven't,\n",
      "I did.\n",
      "I liked it.\n",
      "Did you?\n",
      "Well, they said that one and I'LL FLY AWAY are really quality, you know\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Now I haven't seen I'LL FLY AWAY yet.\n",
      "I haven't seen it either.\n",
      "I think what I need to do is kind of read to see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then I get my bath it's, you know, it's almost too late to start,  something new.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's nearly,  too late for T V.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's the way I am.\n",
      "I get in,  from work\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and I'm tired\n",
      "and I sit and watch for a few minutes\n",
      "so I have to get up and do dinner,  and everything.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, it's like,  we are kind of,   tuned out of our T V.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's us.\n",
      "If we are home on the weekend, we always watch videos,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, we do too.\n",
      "But there are some good shows on.\n",
      "I, I really probably should watch more of them than I do.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But I like,\n",
      "I don't know\n",
      "I, I'm always in to making things\n",
      "and,  And I don't just spend all my time,\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "There's a lot more to do with,  with your time when you get into it.\n",
      "and I, my husband, now he sits and watches T V constantly.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, my, my sister and them and her husband do on weekends.\n",
      "They don't have children yet,\n",
      "and they just turn it on when they walk in,\n",
      "they turn it off when they leave.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "So they are used to that too.\n",
      "I could be around here for hours by myself and never have it on.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I understand.\n",
      "Same here.\n",
      "But, uh, but there are some really good new shows that I have enjoyed,\n",
      "and I'll have to watch that I'LL FLY AWAY this week.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's real good.\n",
      "And then of course, in the afternoons if I get in from work in time I watch OPRAH, some of those,  you know, talk shows.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I like her.\n",
      "I never get in in time for any of those.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, it's, it's nice talking to you.\n",
      "I guess we've kind of exhausted this one,\n",
      "but it's nice talking with you.\n",
      "Well, it's nice talking with you.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Uh, I guess it's, uh,\n",
      "watching the the T V today there had a lot of stuff on, on, uh, crime.\n",
      "In our state right now, uh, recently they've had a lot of, uh, uh, the rapists, uh, murder type, uh, killers going around\n",
      "and well, I, I,\n",
      "Oh, gracious.\n",
      "they've caught them\n",
      "and they, they're in there.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Wasn't it your state that had the, uh, guy that committed all those murders?\n",
      "There was that, uh,\n",
      "Well, yeah,\n",
      "Wisconsin, uh, and Milwaukee area, you know.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that was really on the national news a lot.\n",
      "We heard a lot about that in Texas.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So that's,\n",
      "well, I, I live right on the border of Minnesota and Wisconsin\n",
      "so I kind of get both, both news\n",
      "and, I know, in Minnesota, uh, they had, uh, the one that just, uh, got out and went after a, uh, college student and raped, and killed her\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "and they are not too happy about that now, I guess,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Well, I can imagine.\n",
      "There .\n",
      "It seems like the violent crimes are increasing a lot to me.\n",
      "I, I don't know.\n",
      "I don't know if statistically they are\n",
      "but it seems like you sure hear a, maybe you just hear a lot more about them on the news\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh, that's hard to say for sure.\n",
      "I, uh, sometimes I wonder if these people aren't don't it just for the publicity\n",
      "and, They, they get their names in the, in the paper\n",
      "You wonder about that sometimes.\n",
      "and they become big celebrities.\n",
      "But,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That's kind of scary.\n",
      "I, I wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didn't feature these way out stories.\n",
      "Maybe it wouldn't give other people ideas.\n",
      "Well, uh, I know one I, I think Texas has the death penalty, right?\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "we do.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Do you have it up there?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "no.\n",
      "I see.\n",
      "See I, I\n",
      "Do you think that's a deterrent?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, it's, it's, it's not going to prevent any people from doing it\n",
      "but, the person that's caught, he'll never do it again if he gets the death penalty.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And that's,\n",
      "and there are a lot of repeaters. Uh,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I guess that's another thing that to me is a, a real problem,\n",
      "and I know we have got so many people in our prison system now, at least here in Texas\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean, they are really in a crisis.\n",
      "There has been times they have had to just close off the prisons and leave them in county jails or whatever because there just wasn't enough room for all of them.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And a lot of them they put out on parole\n",
      "and then some of the ones that they put out early, you know, do repeat offenses\n",
      "and, the crime rate is the worst than ever before.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, some, I'm just wondering a lot of times they will put, uh, people, lesser crimes in, uh, with, uh, people that did more severe crimes\n",
      "than they, maybe they just tend to learn from these people\n",
      "and they, and when they get back out, they just go into worse crimes.\n",
      "I think that could be true too.\n",
      "Maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more. Uh,\n",
      "I think the whole parole thing, you know, if somebody is convicted of second-degree murder or something gets fifteen years, well, they are out in six or seven. You know, outbound on the streets again\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And to me that's really scary.\n",
      "Some of these crimes that they commit, you know, seems like the punishment is not really equal to the crime.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, uh, I don't know with, with my limited, uh, psychology background I do have, I don't, I don't even feel that prisons and stuff are, are the answer.\n",
      "If you want to stop the crime, I think you've got to get, uh, the people when they are kids.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "A lot of this probably just starts with, from the, from the homes. Also from the, the, the media, the T V the, uh,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "all these, uh, gory movies on there becomes, uh, just a natural fact of life.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "They think it's okay thing to do.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I think that's a very good point.\n",
      "You know, I,\n",
      "there's a lot more working mothers, a lot more kids in day care centers all that kind of thing.\n",
      "Morality is being taught more by the schools a lot of times than in the home anymore.\n",
      "And,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, a lot of the European countries, uh, they tend to sensor,\n",
      "well, they probably won't sensor so much the sexual stuff as much as the violent.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And they have a lot less crime.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Some of, some of those European countries are, are, you can leave your, your, uh, doors open and, and, and be safe.\n",
      "Uh, even, uh, I think New Zealand is one of, one of the places, uh, that,\n",
      "Well, Sid,\n",
      "have you established what kind of requirements you are looking for, for your next vehicle?\n",
      "Well, I don't know if I really have a, a lot of, uh, requirements.\n",
      "Uh, I guess I look at, uh, getting the best deal.\n",
      "Uh, that's my main objectives normally. Whoever is willing to deal and, and give me a good price.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, I, I tend to be more methodical I guess.\n",
      "Uh, I determine first of all what I'm going to use the vehicle for, whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as a, a personal mover. Uh, where it's going to be driven, you know, what types of, uh, driving I'm going to be doing on it, primarily highway or, or local mileage more often.\n",
      "And, uh, hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that I tend to drive cars for about ten years and a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand miles.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So I'm, I'm real picky.\n",
      "if you are going to keep something that long, you know, you better get something that you wanted to begin with and that you are going to like for a long time.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I don't know I've had pretty good luck, you know,\n",
      "even if, if you take any car and, and you care for it well enough, uh, you are going to get some good life out of it.\n",
      "Uh, my, my Oldsmobile right now that I have, uh, is getting near eighty thousand\n",
      "and it's still in pretty good shape.\n",
      "Uh, there was a flaw in there where a, where a head gasket bolt broke,\n",
      "and it cost me some bucks to, to fix that\n",
      "but that was, you know, something that was unforeseen.\n",
      "But I still think I I'm going to get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Well, it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite a ways also then.\n",
      "Well, I, I drive like the song says, THE LITTLE OLD LADY but, uh, but not FROM PASADENA\n",
      "But, uh,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I, I baby them as much as I possibly can.\n",
      "Uh, it's a pretty big expense nowadays.\n",
      "Uh, and I guess I like to take care of it, uh,\n",
      "so I don't have to buy one too often.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "Uh, do you have more than, than one vehicle in your fleet?\n",
      "Uh, do you have a family fleet\n",
      "or,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, I, I got an old, uh, seventy-six, uh, Grand Fury that, uh, doesn't want to die on me\n",
      "so I, I just keep running the thing. Don't want to sell it or get rid of it until it quits,\n",
      "but it just doesn't seem to want to.\n",
      "I'll probably have, uh, three, four hundred thousand before it wants to die.\n",
      "Well, that may be.\n",
      "They, Chrysler made some really good old engines back then\n",
      "like the, the three eighteen was particularly an exceptionally good engine.\n",
      "Oh. I've got the big three sixty in there, gas guzzler\n",
      "but it runs good.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "At the moment I've got, uh, Cadillac Cimarron which is approaching its tenth year of age and a, uh, reasonably new Plymouth Voyager.\n",
      "It's only a, a couple of years old.\n",
      "But that's the second one of, of those that we've had,\n",
      "and that's the, the family travel vehicle.\n",
      "You know, not only does it do all the, the, uh, carpooling around during the week,\n",
      "but it's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in.\n",
      "I think that what I'm getting ready to get next is probably a Suburban unless they drastically change the, the vehicle a lot.\n",
      "Uh, I'm just getting tired of when I do get hung up in traffic, not being able to determine what the problem is and, and come to some resolution of whether it's better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit and that kind of stuff. Just because I can't see, you know,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm to, my Cimarron is just so small and so low to the ground that I can't see past any vehicle  that's in front of me.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, I'm considering probably some kind of a pickup truck myself for the next vehicle.\n",
      "Uh, I just have so many hauling projects a lot of times\n",
      "and, uh, I, I'd like to just start doing some, uh, carpentry, uh, type work around.\n",
      "I just feel that,\n",
      "So, so what have you seen lately that, um, you think is worthwhile?\n",
      "Um, the last movie I saw was REGARDING HENRY.\n",
      "Have you seen that yet?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I, I saw the previews.\n",
      "It's really good.\n",
      "I loved it.\n",
      "Um, it's, um.\n",
      "Does, does he, does it have a happy ending,\n",
      "or.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "really good ending\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "um, uh, it was the, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.\n",
      "I generally don't get into movies that much,\n",
      "but I saw that one,\n",
      "and then before that one, I saw, um, oh, NAKED GUN TWO AND A HALF.\n",
      "Oh, that was funny, wasn't it\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "did you, have you seen that one?\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "and, and, and, and the regular NAKED GUN and AIRPORT and, you know.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's exactly like AIRPLANE wasn't it\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "But it was silly.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, now these are for two very different movies.\n",
      "One, one, uh, absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly, you know, serious subject.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, I guess I have similarly broad tastes.\n",
      "Um, my most recent, um, movie that I, that I liked a lot, not my most recent movie, was HENRY THE FIFTH.\n",
      "I only rented it, you know, maybe a month ago\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it's been out for a couple of years,\n",
      "but. Have you seen that?\n",
      "I haven't seen that yet.\n",
      "Well, it's, it's a, it's an adaptation of the, of the Shakespeare play,\n",
      "and it's beautifully done.\n",
      "Um, I believe that all the language is as Shakespeare wrote it, except it's been shortened a little bit\n",
      "and there might be a word or two changed.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh, but it's, it's, it's a glorious movie\n",
      "Um. Such as\n",
      "um, and I like, as you know, these, these, these silly movies,\n",
      "and I also like just some strange movies.\n",
      "Do you have any.\n",
      "Well, the, the one that comes immediately to mind, I, um, is the THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, HER LOVER.\n",
      "Um, but there are also these various, um, David Lynch movies.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, I got, I got hooked on TWIN PEAKS.\n",
      "That made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie I could lay my hands on.\n",
      "Oh, really.\n",
      "I haven't seen any of those.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Um well, I don't, I don't especially recommend,\n",
      "They're really good?\n",
      "I mean, you have, you have to just sort of like this thing,\n",
      "you have to like,\n",
      "did you see TWIN PEAKS?\n",
      "Huh-uh,\n",
      "no.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "so, okay.\n",
      "So, if you weren't, if you weren't drawn to watch that, you, maybe you wouldn't be drawn to these movies, either.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "They're, they're just strange.\n",
      "Are they, I mean, is it, like mystery, or suspense\n",
      "Well, uh. I think suspense is the right word.\n",
      "or,\n",
      "Uh, and, but, but, a little bit strange and esoteric\n",
      "and, uh, in the case of TWIN PEAK a little, there's some elements of the supernatural in it, too.\n",
      "Oh really.\n",
      "That was the television show.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Um, there's also a, a a producer of movies in Baltimore called, um, John Walters, who, who puts, puts on even weirder movies.\n",
      "Uh, his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream, like HAIR SPRAY.\n",
      "Um, but back in his early days, he, he, he had things, um, um,\n",
      "what, what are the titles,\n",
      "I can't remember the titles any more. But, some really weird ones, uh, with quite a random crew of, of characters.\n",
      "Um, it would have made, you know, these Fellini movies look normal.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So do you like, um, movies a lot?\n",
      "See I don't do,\n",
      "I don't.\n",
      "I do, I do like movies a lot.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "See, I don't do that,\n",
      "I don't go to movies that often,\n",
      "but, just recently I've been to a couple\n",
      "Do, do you rent them,\n",
      "or.\n",
      "Um, no,\n",
      "we, I just go to like the dollar movie theater around here generally,\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "but, I don't know,\n",
      "I just, I usually fall asleep\n",
      "or I get bored pretty easily\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's what my wife does too, um,\n",
      "I mean, she falls asleep\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So we have to, we have to pick just the right kind of movie to, to, to, to appeal.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "that's exactly right.\n",
      "Well, well it was good talking to you.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's good to talk to you, too.\n",
      "Take care.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "bye.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "did they tell you our topic?\n",
      "Uh, no,\n",
      "somebody else answered the phone and put my number in.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "it's, uh,\n",
      "Uh, what is the topic?\n",
      "The topic is cars.\n",
      "What kind of car will you buy next\n",
      "and what kind of decision you'd, do you think about getting, you know, pick that car out and, uh, and why.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Uh, my next car to buy probably would be a Cadillac.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I've had, uh,\n",
      "well, I'm on my third one.\n",
      "And I'm not real sure that I'd be in the market for a car for quite a while.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I'm the same way.\n",
      "I was, uh, I had two Cadillacs.\n",
      "I went to my first Lincoln this last time.\n",
      "I travel\n",
      "and, uh, my grandfather worked for Ford Motor Company\n",
      "so he always said why don't you drive a Ford, or why don't you try a Lincoln\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so I finally tried one after fifty years\n",
      "My,\n",
      "and, uh, I've had, I guess, I guess four Cadillacs and, and one Suburban in my last five cars,\n",
      "but I bought a Lincoln\n",
      "and I like it.\n",
      "My dad has been a, a, uh, Lincoln man for a lot of years,\n",
      "but I've always been a G M man.\n",
      "I'm in the auto parts business myself.\n",
      "Oh, are you?\n",
      "And, uh, the last Cadillac I bought was an Allante.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I just love it to death.\n",
      "I'm not sure I'd ever get rid of it.\n",
      "Well, I'm a, I'm a traveling salesman.\n",
      "I travel on the road\n",
      "so I like a little heavier car\n",
      "but,\n",
      "I used to do that quite a bit myself.\n",
      "So that's why I choose, you know, to drive a heavier car and more luxury car.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But, I tell you what,\n",
      "I will probably get a Cadillac the next time quite honestly.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "because I like the Lincoln\n",
      "but, there's just something about that Cadillac that, whether it's a G M C product or whatever. Seems they handle better.\n",
      "They seem to put, They seem to be put together a little bit better.\n",
      "I think so, too.\n",
      "And, you know, the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than Ford products\n",
      "and I think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from, uh, imports is they put so much, you know, gadgetry on the dash\n",
      "and, and the, the buttons are so small to push\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they really do.\n",
      "and G M doesn't seem to do that.\n",
      "I kind of like that feature,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "You know, I'm a funny duck\n",
      "that came, it comes to the simple things like front end alignments\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I have never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac.\n",
      "I don't know why, why whether I just seem to drive them better or what,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, I've never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac.\n",
      "They always appear to hold well.\n",
      "I've, uh, I had an Eldorado, was my first one, was an eighty\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, I think at about sixty thousand miles I finally had it lined up.\n",
      "Did you.\n",
      "And I had them do all four wheels.\n",
      "And the only thing I miss about a Cadillac is,\n",
      "a Fleetwood Brougham was my last car\n",
      "and I traded it in, traded it in on my Lincoln\n",
      "and they're just not as large as before.\n",
      "I do miss that.\n",
      "That's true,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "But, what is big today.\n",
      "Well, you're right.\n",
      "You know. Lincoln is still as big as it always has been\n",
      "but,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's big,\n",
      "but the trunk space for me, uh,\n",
      "what I usually do is I usually take the back seat out of my car\n",
      "and that's where I put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough.\n",
      "You know a car I ran across recently that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "now, I have the Town Car\n",
      "and it's, it's a deep trunk, but not as broad as the, uh, the Cadillac.\n",
      "Well, the Town Car, I noticed, uh,\n",
      "or with the, with the Continental, uh, I was, rented one, one time uh, we could, uh, put golf clubs in them.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, good.\n",
      "You know, straight across.\n",
      "I mean,\n",
      "They went all the way down?\n",
      "Front to back.\n",
      "Well, that's good.\n",
      "Not going from side to side.\n",
      "That's good.\n",
      "And we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I sell sporting goods, uh, hunting related items,\n",
      "I sell guns, gun cases and things like that\n",
      "I see.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and I need to, you know,\n",
      "that's about the same size as a golf club.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "They need to, samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that\n",
      "and,\n",
      "I don't know if you've ever looked at a Continental.\n",
      "Nope.\n",
      "Uh, it's not as peppy as a, as a Town Car\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "because it's a V Six,\n",
      "but it, uh,\n",
      "I I drove it from here to Memphis\n",
      "and I really enjoyed driving that car.\n",
      "If I was going to buy a Ford product, that's what I would buy.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I drove mine a couple weeks ago to our, one of our big national sales meetings in Nashville.\n",
      "I usually fly.\n",
      "I drove it with another one of my guy that worked for me.\n",
      "We drove it ten hours to Nashville,\n",
      "and it, it handled real well,\n",
      "but, my main thing is space,\n",
      "so if a Continental,\n",
      "I might consider it the next time,\n",
      "a Continental has more trunk space.\n",
      "You might take a look at them.\n",
      "They, they had a, a lot more trunk space.\n",
      "As a matter of fact, they had more trunk space than my, uh, Sedan De Ville had.\n",
      "You always have leather interiors on your Cadillacs?\n",
      "Uh, all three of mine have had leather interiors,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I like leather interiors also.\n",
      "Uh, I had a eighty Eldorado, which was leather\n",
      "and, uh, then my eighty-six was a touring sedan.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, it had the gray leather package in it\n",
      "and my Allante has, uh I guess saddle, saddle colored type thing.\n",
      "That's a nice car.\n",
      "You bet,\n",
      "and I'll, I will say one thing about Cadillacs versus,\n",
      "Uh, so my favorite team is about the Rangers.\n",
      "Is it?\n",
      "I'd have to agree with that.\n",
      "They are my favorite team, too.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "A little disappointing the last few years.\n",
      "I'm telling you.\n",
      "You think they'll sign Ruben?\n",
      "You know I really don't.\n",
      "No?\n",
      "I just don't think, you know, with that guy from Pittsburgh getting all that money, twenty-seven or twenty-nine million or whatever it was, I just don't think that they're going to be able to sign Ruben Sierra\n",
      "and it's just going to be a shame for, you know, our area.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I think it's going to have a big effect if they don't on the other, uh, Hispanic players.\n",
      "Oh, I do, too.\n",
      "I just,\n",
      "I think that's going to be the big problem.\n",
      "The main thing,\n",
      "It's just going to effect on the, the team, you know.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "We just can't seem to, you know,\n",
      "I think we've been in this spot,\n",
      "I think we finished second once or maybe even twice.\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "I I'm, I haven't been to a baseball game in a couple of years.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's just, it's just too disappointing.\n",
      "I just watch them fall every year.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I was a Pete Incaviglia fan\n",
      "and, uh I liked him,\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "but, of course, I understand baseball decisions are all just,\n",
      "decisions like that have to be made by someone\n",
      "Glad it's not me making them.\n",
      "Right\n",
      "I think they just want to stay mediocre and draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here.\n",
      "But,\n",
      "They say as long as they draw up two million fans that Greave and Valentine will be there.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "So, and that's the name of the game, too.\n",
      "You got to make money. You know, pay these players so much money,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "now, it's just it's frightening.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "You and I should be so lucky to, you know, to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat or something like that.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "But, uh, they were talking about trading him, if they're not able to sign him and, uh, use the money that it would take to sign the guy, you know, to pay for pitchers or, you know, what it, what it, what they, what else they need.\n",
      "Because they've got the hitting,\n",
      "but they need the pitching.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they really do.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "I think they, uh, I think they need them all.\n",
      "I just don't I understand the big cities, like in New York or L A or somewhere because big cities\n",
      "and, you know, a guy, a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon and probably make five thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at a at a men's clothing store, or something, or sporting goods store,\n",
      "Oh, I know.\n",
      "but, I realize the difference,\n",
      "but, I just don't understand,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working, you know, your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game.\n",
      "Oh, I know.\n",
      "I tell you.\n",
      "It's real aggravating,\n",
      "but,\n",
      "But, one thing I don't understand is why a group, you know, headed up by George Bush would buy the Texas Rangers and not really get behind them\n",
      "because I tell you, we need a winner in this town.\n",
      "It looks like our Cowboys are coming back\n",
      "but, So that's, that's going to be a big help to Dallas,\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "but, you know, in the past half a dozen years, all we've had is the, uh the soccer team.\n",
      "It's always got,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's always, it's always wondered me why, I mean, they act as though this area is not, you know, a big metropolitan area,\n",
      "but you think we'd, someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the, the, the players we need.\n",
      "Oh, I know.\n",
      "It's,\n",
      "Just real aggravating to\n",
      "because I've lived here, you know, since, well, I was born and raised here,\n",
      "so I've been a Ranger fan since about seventy-seven,\n",
      "so it's a lot of losers\n",
      "Oh, I know.\n",
      "It's about to get, you know as bad as the Cubs or whoever, you know.\n",
      "I've been one,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I've been, I've lived here since seventy-four\n",
      "and I've really been a Ranger fan for the longest time\n",
      "and excuse me, I don't miss a time picking up the morning paper and checking the box score.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I mean I follow them\n",
      "and I follow them like I follow the Mavericks and like I follow the Cowboys,\n",
      "but, and I want to see them win, because you know, damn it, they, the fans deserve it.\n",
      "I mean, it, You know, we have pretty, uh, great fans, put two million people in that stadium.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I'm telling you.\n",
      "I love Nolan Ryan.\n",
      "I guess you probably love him, too.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "I think this town would go crazy if they ever got a, even a playoff team.\n",
      "Oh, I do, too.\n",
      "I mean, It would be packed.\n",
      "And they got that new stadium they are building.\n",
      "So, at least, at least that will be exciting when we get that,\n",
      "It will.\n",
      "but,\n",
      "Well, where do you think they are heading this year?\n",
      "Uh, it's hard to say.\n",
      "It's going to be depending on where the, what they do with Ruben Sierra\n",
      "and, uh, I mean, I'm getting tired of them going into each year saying, you know, Bobby Witt is the answer and Kevin Brown is the answer,\n",
      "Right\n",
      "and, man, that's getting old, you know.\n",
      "These guys have been pampered.\n",
      "I mean, it's time to, to either, you know, put out or shut up.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "Bobby Witt gets forced into wins like seventeen games or whatever\n",
      "And,\n",
      "and they have the later ten game winning streak\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and they give him all kinds of money\n",
      "and then he just goes right down the tubes.\n",
      "And Valentine and Greave, they're about to get, you know, they're about to get old.\n",
      "But I like this Sandy Johnson.\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I forgot we had to hit one\n",
      "Our time will be up.\n",
      "Well, I hit one and nothing happened.\n",
      "What's going on?\n",
      "Well, just go ahead and talk,\n",
      "that's all.\n",
      "Are you sure?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Don't they usually tell you to say something?\n",
      "I don't think so.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "we're supposed to talk about lawn and garden.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I'm, I'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn and garden.\n",
      "What do I do?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, I, uh, I cut it occasionally.\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "you're ahead of me.\n",
      "Is, uh, is that good?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That's better.\n",
      "And I edge it occasionally.\n",
      "Oh, that's really good.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "see, am I good, or what?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, uh, Uh, much beyond that I don't do\n",
      "I don't do any of that.\n",
      "Really,\n",
      "well, I call my lawn man, Eric, whatever his name is, I can't remember. Who's going to come and build me a fence, too.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, he is going to build you a fence.\n",
      "Well, he's giving me an estimate.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And for ten dollars a week, I don't see any reason for me to be doing it.\n",
      "What, for a fence?\n",
      "Oh, well, I thought, isn't he the same one?\n",
      "he is.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but ten dollars, or what what does he charge, not even that.\n",
      "What does he charge me?\n",
      "Well, my,\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "It's like next to nothing.\n",
      "it's ten because I,\n",
      "it's forty a month.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But if there's five weeks, I still pay forty.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but you know, you ought to get him to pull the weeds.\n",
      "Well, he won't pull weeds.\n",
      "He says he'll spray them,\n",
      "but he won't pull them.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Uh, he won't cut them is what he won't do. Because he said with the rocks that it's too dangerous for him to take the, the trimmer over the rocks\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and he's right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "But he just says to keep spraying them so,\n",
      "Well so,\n",
      "Anyway, Gene sprayed them once or twice for me\n",
      "so that was real,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "so you haven't, you haven't pulled any weeds lately?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "There are two out front\n",
      "I thought I'd grab one of these days,\n",
      "but I haven't bothered as I walk on by.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I started to pull the weeds in the rocks out front\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and all of a sudden I came cross this big clump of weeds\n",
      "and there was dog dirt in it\n",
      "Oh, oh, goody.\n",
      "and I threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there\n",
      "and I left the whole thing\n",
      "and  that was about a month ago.\n",
      "I thought you were going to say there  I thought you were going to say there was a snake in the weeds\n",
      "I would rather a snake,\n",
      "no\n",
      "Oh, God, oh\n",
      "I just left the whole thing.\n",
      "The bag is still out there because I haven't touched it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I haven't gone back over there.\n",
      "It really made me mad.\n",
      "Oh, God.\n",
      "So anyway but,\n",
      "But, uh, how are your, your flowers, your little things you planted?\n",
      "Did they die or what?\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "now they died.\n",
      "Oh, they're all,\n",
      "so they, oh,\n",
      "are they going to come back in the spring?\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "and then I got some nice, uh, mums at Thanksgiving that I put in the pots out there\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "They looked real pretty until about a week before Christmas,\n",
      "then they started to die, too.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "So, I don't think any of it comes back\n",
      "but I don't know,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "maybe these,\n",
      "sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to.\n",
      "I don't know, uh,\n",
      "So,\n",
      "Those flowers, remember those little ones you gave me?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, they're, I know they were still blooming up until about a, a few weeks ago.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, that's good.\n",
      "They're the best kind.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "they, They're really pretty.\n",
      "They, they're like indestructible.\n",
      "They really grow nice\n",
      "and sometimes, they're not supposed to come back,\n",
      "but lots of times they do.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "We'll see.\n",
      "They're letting us have a lot of time on this aren't they?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I mean isn't it supposed to be five minutes?\n",
      "But that's because we didn't hit one for a long time.\n",
      "We didn't disconnect, did we\n",
      "I hope not\n",
      "Neither one of us is getting paid for this.\n",
      "Boy, I hate to think I hate to think I'd be talking to you without getting paid\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "really,\n",
      "I know it.\n",
      "I can't believe this.\n",
      "I got somebody from Utah and somebody,\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "where was the person last night was from far away.\n",
      "You're kidding?\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "And we get each other down the street.\n",
      "This is so funny.\n",
      "Well, the, uh,\n",
      "I, I talked to someone woman from Oklahoma City and some woman from Dallas\n",
      "and that was it.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I've had Dallas, Arlington.\n",
      "I've had, uh, one Plano and then a lady from Brigham, Utah whose  son lives in Plano on Ranier someplace. And then, uh, another state,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "I can't remember,\n",
      "but she told me about the Utah Jazz,\n",
      "we talked about basketball.\n",
      "Oh, really\n",
      "And I don't remember what, what the place was last night,\n",
      "but I'm thinking Colorado,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but I'm not sure\n",
      "I'd know the place, anyway.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "But mostly they're from the area.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It,\n",
      "Well, there isn't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes.\n",
      "Not for me.\n",
      "Not for me either.\n",
      "You know, not not for me because all I have is rocks and weeds.\n",
      "What do I,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but I don't, you know,\n",
      "I, what do I do, cut it one, you know, and, and edge it\n",
      "and that's about it.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "What do I do with it?\n",
      "I know,\n",
      "we're not typical Texans.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "What's going on,\n",
      "are they going to tell us to stop or what\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "I hope so.\n",
      "Come on,\n",
      "come on.\n",
      "Isn't it five minutes?\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I, I mean, I'm all talked out about gardens.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Well, we can talk about something else.\n",
      "It's just a suggested topic.\n",
      "Oh, oh, it's just suggested?\n",
      "So, how's the baby, do you think\n",
      "What?\n",
      "How's the,\n",
      "We could talk, Let's talk about the baby.\n",
      "Let's talk about the baby.\n",
      "Do you want to tell me about your budgeting plan?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "our budgeting plan includes me getting a job\n",
      "We're, we're at the point now,\n",
      "I I quit working about six months ago to start this house\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I'm out of cash\n",
      "and I'm not out of project yet.\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "So, uh, I'm going to go back and do some consulting work.\n",
      "As far as budget's concerned, I'm, I'm fairly fortunate.\n",
      "Uh, we've, we're right now where if we don't buy anything extra, we can make it on what my wife makes.\n",
      "So, you know, the project's kind of halted until then.\n",
      "But as far as budgeting is concerned, you know, we have, uh, some pretty strict guidelines that we go for, you know,\n",
      "we always put ten percent back,\n",
      "and that's a never touch.\n",
      "Uh, into savings.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Either savings or investment, one of the two,\n",
      "but we don't ever put it in a high risk.\n",
      "It's just always going to be there.\n",
      "Well, that's pretty good.\n",
      "And as far as the rest of it's concerned, we don't have any kind of, uh, what I would call extravagant expenses, you know,\n",
      "we, uh, we pretty much live on about eight, nine hundred a month, you know, just travel to and from work and clothing and food\n",
      "Boy, that's pretty good.\n",
      "and the rest of it, you know, we pile into the house.\n",
      "And, uh, you know, I'm fairly fortunate.\n",
      "I mean, our credit cards are out to the max right now because I'm a little behind on that,\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "but, uh, we're still making the payments on them.\n",
      "It's just, when you,\n",
      "see in Texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home  and do it yourself.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's, it's tough here too.\n",
      "You have to have the contractor sign with you.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "exactly.\n",
      "But it's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      ", where I live, that is.\n",
      "And where I live, it, it's pretty scary, because Texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that and you screw up, you don't get it finished,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "the bank can eat the contractor.\n",
      "Oh, bad for him, huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "bad for him.\n",
      "But, the homeowner can't be touched.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "It's a homestead state.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "see right now if I quit paying any of my bills,\n",
      "the only thing they could do is cut off electricity.\n",
      "They can't take your land unless you don't pay your land taxes. Period.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "You know. They can take your car and your clothes and your, anything\n",
      "that's not the tools of your trade,\n",
      "but as far as, uh, you know you're pretty much bullet proof in this state.\n",
      "Well, that's kind of handy.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I just finished James Michener's TEXAS book.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Pretty interesting.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Texas has quite the history.\n",
      "Well, you know, we're, we're not ones to budget much, you know\n",
      "We just going to spend it all.\n",
      "That's kind of what we do.\n",
      "We, uh, we're L D S\n",
      "and so we pay ten percent tithing\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and then, you know, we put I guess it's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But that sometimes we use for emergency type things.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But, uh, and my wife doesn't work.\n",
      "We're fortunate that way, that I make enough to do what we want to do.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "we're pretty, pretty fortunate as far as the, uh, the budgeting is concerned, because, you know, we don't have any long term debt.\n",
      "You know, uh, we paid cash for car.\n",
      "Well, we bought the car on time, one of them,\n",
      "but we, you know, we since paid it off.\n",
      "Well that's pretty.\n",
      "The land is paid for cash,\n",
      "so we don't have to worry about that.\n",
      "That's a great position to be in.\n",
      "Well, it's fraught with other problems\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I'm not very motivated\n",
      "Oh\n",
      "What kind of consulting do you do?\n",
      "Uh, systems consulting. Computerization for construction firms.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm into computers, too.\n",
      "I I'm a E D P auditor.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And.\n",
      "You into mainframes?\n",
      "and P C s.\n",
      "oh really?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm just brushing up on, well, C plus plus.\n",
      "Are you really?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And,\n",
      "I just got that a few days ago.\n",
      "Three oh?\n",
      "Oh, gees,\n",
      "don't get me to lying.\n",
      "I bought it at a fire sale.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "This guy's place burned down,\n",
      "and you can't, the American government you can't trust them either, because you think, you don't know how corrupt they are. I mean they keep people in power like the Shah of Iran and, things like that,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I mean, it's the lesser of two evils,\n",
      "they will probably say this is the lesser of two evils.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But I don't know how corrupt the Honduran government is.\n",
      "But the,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they need to have more checks and balances in their government to get rid of the corruption. But I think first though,\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "they need to, I think they need the repentance on the leadership of the different nations for all their, uh, you know the atrocities that they commit and the drug dealings, and in the, just in the drug crimes,\n",
      "because I feel like a lot of the leadership in those nations are so engrossed in the drug crimes that until they repent or they are moved from power, that you know,\n",
      "because there are so many of them that the next one to come up, if you just knock one off and then have another one,\n",
      "and I know a lot of those nations, there's, uh, Brazil, I know, is like forty percent evangelical Christian. Not just go to church but, you know, really on fire for God,\n",
      "and they are just surpassing America, Latin America by the drugs.\n",
      "You know, it's just incomprehensible,\n",
      "and, uh, so I just think that, I think that God is going to honor that and that he is going to put in some good leadership,\n",
      "and I know, the president of, I believe Costa Rica is a Christian.\n",
      "And he goes to, no Guatemala, because he goes to virgo church in Guatemala City.\n",
      "The church is in real close relationship with him.\n",
      "And he is a former president of Guatemala.\n",
      "He's an elder at virgo church\n",
      "and, you know that, that God is doing something\n",
      "and he is raising up some leaders\n",
      "and the people want him back as president bad,\n",
      "but they have a rule in Guatemala that he can't have another term\n",
      "and so the, the people are trying to override that, I mean not just the Christians, but all the people because they see when a righteous man is in authority, the people rejoice.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "good.\n",
      "See, that's the thing,\n",
      "that it's going, have to,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "that's the undoing of everything,\n",
      "and it's the,\n",
      "we have no morals, when we, talk about the crime and all that in the city,\n",
      "it's just the kids have no morals.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "That's the thing that will eventually, you know,\n",
      "if anyone is going to be saved.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It is having a good moral background.\n",
      "And it's funny you mention Costa Rica, because they are just, they are one of the most successful and peaceful countries, in Central America.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "So, I was reading an article in the, uh, National Geographic\n",
      "and, I don't know,\n",
      "I don't think they have any more money than any of the other countries,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "they don't have oil or anything,\n",
      "and they don't have big tourism.\n",
      "So maybe it is their faith that enables them to keep the crime out.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I know that Costa Rica, they don't allow anybody to come that, uh, to come any, uh, what do you call, what do you call immigrants?\n",
      "They don't allow anything like that\n",
      "like I could not go to Costa Rica and live as an American citizen.\n",
      "They would not permit me to live there to work.\n",
      "They wouldn't.\n",
      "Their jobs are there for Costa Ricans.\n",
      "They don't allow people to move in, like less nations, you know,\n",
      "They don't, they don't probably take a lot of refugees from other countries either.\n",
      "take the job.\n",
      "No\n",
      "they don't take any.\n",
      "I mean I couldn't even go there.\n",
      "My husband had to receive all this special permission to go,\n",
      "so even with, uh, you know, in, uh, inner company, you know, transfer, or something,\n",
      "and I have another friend in, uh, Costa Rica that,\n",
      "she was born there.\n",
      "She's Costa Rican.\n",
      "I guess I do know a little bit.\n",
      "I went to Mexico City one time and stayed.\n",
      "I have been there twice and stayed\n",
      "and, that, aw, that was just really sad.\n",
      "But, a lot of it though is their debt.\n",
      "I think that we should not loan them anymore money,\n",
      "that if we still want to give them money, give them money, quit loaning it to them.\n",
      "You're not going to get it back.\n",
      "Don't be indebted to anybody.\n",
      "Don't be the loaner or borrower.\n",
      "It's just not good.\n",
      "We need to, if we feel like we need to give them money then give it to them,\n",
      "but quit loaning all the money out.\n",
      "Which I don't think we are loaning anymore now,\n",
      "but that's how we got into a problem.\n",
      "If we got, the,\n",
      "we have, we went in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars.\n",
      "That's common sense,\n",
      "you could just look at it and say they're not going to be able to pay us back.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "also, uh, uh, Mexico, uh, we will loan the money in uh,\n",
      "a lot of the higher, the higher people, were just stealing it and, building these beautiful homes, and nice ranches and things.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So we are, we're suckers.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we, we are, it's like we are partly responsible for their problems by loaning them all that money,\n",
      "that was really stupid on our part to even loan it to them.\n",
      "You don't loan money to people like that.\n",
      "I mean if you feel like you need to give them something to help them out, fine,\n",
      "but you don't go making billions of dollars of loans in, to people that you can just look at the situation,\n",
      "They know they're not going to pay it back.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and know that they are going to be capable of paying us back,\n",
      "and that puts a bondage on them.\n",
      "It makes, you know, pressure on the nation, and on the people, and on the leadership, and makes their inflation go up,\n",
      "and it's just a big mess.\n",
      "Did you go to Mexico City, uh, anywhere near when the earthquake hit.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "but I knew people,\n",
      "I was there before that,\n",
      "but I knew people,\n",
      "I got a letter from a friend of mine that I had met there, that who, who the apartment building was destroyed\n",
      "and they were living in a tent,\n",
      "so it's kind of weird, you know.\n",
      "To these people who were on U S dive, the Mexican diving, we went to the pool together, and watched them dive and all this,\n",
      "so they were you know, just normal people, weren't squatters or poor people or anything that, uh,\n",
      "I did, I knew all of my friends there,\n",
      "but none of them that I know of, got killed in it.\n",
      "But, uh, they're all Christians though.\n",
      "God really protected them.\n",
      "See that broke out a revival in Mexico City. That C B S news and A B C never told you about.\n",
      "There's been a real revival in Mexico City since that earthquake, because there's a lot of, you know there's a lot of sin in those nations and a lot, lots of witchcraft, a lot of witchcraft. A whole lot of witchcraft. So, a lot of it in the name of Christianity.\n",
      "Oh, I can imagine.\n",
      "Oh, really.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "There's a lot, you know\n",
      "they call themselves Christians,\n",
      "but you know they are over there doing witchcraft and stuff, and just a whole lot of the generational things too, like the Mayans and the Incas.\n",
      "You can't find a trace of them because God totally destroyed them for how wicked they were.\n",
      "And yet, they are revered and honored and almost worshiped by\n",
      "so many people,\n",

      "I've been down to the pyramids\n",
      "and I have climbed to the top of the pyramid where they used to take a beating heart out of a young thirteen year old boy,\n",
      "and they hold it up to the sun God,\n",
      "and that's pretty of heavy duty.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "is, is there still blood stains on the altar\n",
      "or has it worn away through the years?\n",
      "I don't think so.\n",
      "The little box is black on the top of the pyramid in the sun.\n",
      "It's black,\n",
      "so\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "you can't really tell,\n",
      "but it was kind of weird, you know,\n",
      "you think, wow there is where they did sacrifices to false Gods.\n",
      "Do you get spooked, you feel,\n",
      "or do you get butterflies in your stomach when you go there?\n",
      "Because,\n",
      "Uh, at that time, I kind of did.\n",
      "It really impressed me, just you know, feeling\n",
      "but I wasn't a Christian when I went there,\n",
      "but, uh, I think that a lot of those, those you know, generational things\n",
      "I think, that God sees I'm praying, you know,\n",
      "that keeps the Christians that are beginning to rise up there to be able to pray, because that does affect that things, you know, in your background.\n",
      "Hi, Maureen.\n",
      "How are you?\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Well do you have a family budget?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "we probably should,\n",
      "but we haven't.\n",
      "So why don't you explain to me some good tips about what you've done, which you've found useful and workable.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "We do a few things,\n",
      "and I have to say we're, my husband and I are both from financial backgrounds.\n",
      "I, I'm an accountant.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, he has an M B A,\n",
      "so, uh, we were sort of, you know, keyed in on expenses and things like that.\n",
      "So\n",
      "Um, okay.\n",
      "Um, coming from that background, what we pretty much do is we, in our household, as far as living expenses, we live on a cash budget.\n",
      "Every month, my husband, uh, goes to the credit union and withdraws, you know, X amount of dollars for the month,\n",
      "and then that money is used during that month.\n",
      "We have a certain budget.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Excuse me. For instance, I control all the household expenses, the groceries, uh, the haircuts, the gasoline for my car, any miscellaneous expenses, baby-sitting, things like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, excuse me, if, uh, it comes the end of the month and I don't have any money, uh, we don't buy any more milk\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "But, uh, we've gotten pretty good at it,\n",
      "we've been doing it a couple of years now.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, we, our budgets are realistic\n",
      "and they are not so stringent and, you know to make us feel uncomfortable.\n",
      "Hm.\n",
      "And I, I really try to stretch my, my dollars here and there, shopping, uh, at warehouses sometimes, like at Sam's and things like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, uh, we live, we live on, on a cash budget\n",
      "and it, sometimes it's tight come the end of the month,\n",
      "but generally, we always make it.\n",
      "What do you do for the surprise things that you don't necessarily plan for,\n",
      "the, you know are sometimes several hundred dollars, like, uh, tires for the car or car repair of some sort, or, like a, a dental bill or something that you're not prepared for?\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Well, uh, most of our medical things, we don't, uh, have to worry about, because of insurance\n",
      "and they're, they're relatively small.\n",
      "Uh, we've been lucky.\n",
      "In the past we didn't have that problem\n",
      "but right now we don't.\n",
      "For the other things, the things that crop up, that we aren't really expecting, we have different funds set aside for different things.\n",
      "Like we have a car fund\n",
      "and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "So, I mean,\n",
      "and I, I can't really remember what it is.\n",
      "Do you kind of continue, call this like, a part of savings account or a different savings account\n",
      "or,\n",
      "It's all part of the savings account.\n",
      "We just keep track of it on paper.\n",
      "Uh, you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account.\n",
      "We decide, okay, you know, let's say it's a hundred dollars.\n",
      "You know, every month fifteen dollars is for car fund. You know,\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever.\n",
      "Uh, and we just, we constantly do that, so that there's a buildup of money for those things if something does come up.\n",
      "Like I know that my washing machine is going to go any day.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "So, but, we have the money set aside,\n",
      "so if it does it's not going to kill us.\n",
      "Hm.\n",
      "Uh, so we're, we're actually, we're pretty disciplined,\n",
      "so it makes those surprises not so difficult to get through.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "then, so like your pay, what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that, you know, will cover all of the expenses, kind of thing?\n",
      "Well, in.\n",
      "Or like what, what percent, do you then save or something?\n",
      "Uh, we have a lot of different things.\n",
      "Right now, we save about twenty-five percent of our, of our pay.\n",
      "Hm, okay.\n",
      "It, and it goes toward different things,\n",
      "it's for, you know, for vacations like I said, for, you know, emergencies like for car, uh, breaks down, something like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, and we also put money aside for our kids college.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Neither of us had any help with our college degrees,\n",
      "and just this last month we paid off my final school loan.\n",
      "So\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "We're starting our kids a little bit early.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you, uh, use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things?\n",
      "Checking account a lot, uh, not so much credit cards.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "and so pretty much now, uh, we don't use them too much.\n",
      "If we travel or something, yeah. But, you know. Standard, we usually don't.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Or if it, it is a purchase, uh, then it's paid off when the bill comes.\n",
      "You know, so it isn't any extended, uh,\n",
      "it may be that I picked up something at the store,\n",
      "but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then,\n",
      "so it's not any, you know, uh, build up on the charge cards at all.\n",
      "That's good.\n",
      "And, but that hasn't always been the case\n",
      "So, I'm kind of,\n",
      "I feel at least better now that I have finally gotten some of those things, uh, you know, in the past,\n",
      "and I don't have, you know, big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards, because that interest rate just is a killer.\n",
      "Oh, and it's not deductible anymore.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, I've never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow.\n",
      "But, uh, pretty much when I always, I go to the grocery store or something I just always write checks.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We did, we did that for a long time\n",
      "and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things.\n",
      "Hm.\n",
      "And it seemed like we didn't have enough money when things cropped up, you know,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget.\n",
      "Well the first time we did it, we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and then we kept track of everything for a month. You know, how much we spent on food, how much we spent on gasoline, how much we spent on everything, and from that built, you know, a cash budget.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So now, I mean, I have,\n",
      "I don't remember what it is now, four hundred dollars for the month, let's say.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, I mean some months I may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else,\n",
      "and some months it may be different.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves, you know, down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing,\n",
      "but the way we set up, you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for, you know, uh, utilities and, uh, the house payment and all that.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "those are things you don't really have much control over.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, the cash budget just fits right in there\n",
      "like I said if we don't have, we also set aside money for entertainment.\n",
      "I mean, but again it's a set amount every month. And, uh, on special occasions, I mean birthdays and things like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "We, we don't, we still have fun on things\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, we are in the process of trying to buy a house,\n",
      "do you know, how did your budget work\n",
      "or did you have a budget to, uh, get your down payment going to get a house?\n",
      "Well, no\n",
      "not originally, because when we, we did buy, when we bought our first house, it was at a time where you\n",
      "and the kind of loan we got, you really didn't have to put down anything.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "So, we got into it fairly cheaply,\n",
      "and then, uh, after we sold the first house, we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "So, we, we got out of that one pretty easily\n",
      "Okay, uh,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I just keep thinking all the time\n",
      "I mean, it, it's really rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your, you know, your priority, at least mine is to save for the house.\n",
      "But then it's awful hard to really scrimp for a long, long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment.\n",
      "You feel like you want to live a little bit in the meantime.\n",
      "Sure,\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "That's how I feel sometimes about my kids' education,\n",
      "I mean jeez, they are one and four\n",
      "We have got a long time to save,\n",
      "my husband, he's the real, he's the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, no,\n",
      "no\n",
      "Well, I know,\n",
      "but there are times when I sit there and I think, wow, you know we make X amount of money and where is it.\n",
      "I mean you look around\n",
      "and you go,  where is it,\n",
      "What do you do with it,\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "you, you haven't made, uh, big purchases\n",
      "and that's the easier thing to see,\n",
      "if you can see a big purchase and you go okay, well this is the year that we bought the couch or the T V, or something like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "But, all those, just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door\n",
      "and there's big chunks of your money to pay like the utilities and the gas and the groceries, and stuff.\n",
      "That you don't have tangible, I mean the perishable kind of things that's gone, used and gone.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's, it's amazing how much we spend on some things.\n",
      "My husband cut himself down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And that's all he has,\n",
      "he has a ten dollar bill.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "And, I mean, so I'd say at least, two usually three times a week he takes his lunch.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "The other times, he'll, uh, I don't know go out somewhere, eat in a cafeteria or whatever.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, but he keeps himself on that,\n",
      "I mean, he found it's, it's so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That's a hundred dollars a month on lunch.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That's, that's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "When he can take a sandwich, you know.\n",
      "Well, how about you, are you an exercise fanatic?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Me either\n",
      "I'm definitely\n",
      "I do like to walk.\n",
      "Do you?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Since T I has, uh, uh, instituted that, um, walkabout, I have gone out and started walking even more, bought me the, you know, the proper shoes and everything to get started, and, uh, park out there, you know, way out there in the boondocks.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Wonderful. Uh-huh.\n",
      "It was so funny the other day,\n",
      "I took some guys to, to lunch\n",
      "and when we came back they said \"Oh, there's a parking space real close,\" and I parked way out in the boonies,\n",
      "Way. *what is this?\n",
      "and I said \"you can walk off your lunch.\"\n",
      "That's the way to do it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm kind of like you,\n",
      "I've never really gotten into it,\n",
      "it's just a, it's just a chore, you know,\n",
      "Um, um. Oh.\n",
      "and I finally decided one semester, I'm in college and I'm taking night classes and I still don't have any of my P E classes,\n",
      "and so one semester I thought, okay, that's what I'm going to do\n",
      "and that will get me where I'll have to do it, you know,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they were offering a, a walking class, where you, you know, you have to walk, you know, that like for every mile you walk and every so many minutes, you get, you get points, you know,\n",
      "Um, um. Um, um.\n",
      "and then you have to go in once a week and log your points\n",
      "so it's not like you can do the class like anytime you want, you know,\n",
      "and, at the end of the semester you go back in and your, like your final exam is a three mile walk.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And if you walk it in this many minutes, you get an A,\n",
      "this many minutes you get a B,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, I thought, oh, this will be an easy class.\n",
      "and, you know, and I did it, and I did it for a long time\n",
      "like about the middle of the semester I ended up having to have surgery on my foot,\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "and this has been a couple of years ago,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, you know, I had, I did that,\n",
      "and I just ended up having to drop the class.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "you know, by the time the final came around, I wasn't even where I could wear a shoe yet, let alone walk three miles, you know.\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But, that was the only time I have ever been able to like start an exercise program and really stick to it, because then I had to, I had to go every week and log in what I had walked,\n",
      "Um, um. Right.\n",
      "and, my teacher looked at it every week, you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, other than that I just, you know, I kind of get in the mood every once in awhile, say, okay, I'm going to start going to aerobics now, you know,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "and, I'll go for like two weeks and go, this is for the birds, this is too much work.\n",
      "Well, you know, I have noticed too that, uh, when I started the exercise, uh, not the exercise but the walking program, uh, that I did tone up, you know, like all over,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but it didn't get the upper part of my body,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, so, what I do, is I bowl.\n",
      "I am a fanatic when it comes to bowling,\n",
      "and I used to bowl five times a week,\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "so, I really loved it,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and I still bowl at least once a week now, on a league, on, on a,\n",
      "and I'm bowling on the T I league.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, but I've noticed that what I do is that I have my towel that sits on the floor, so that every time I get up to bowl, I have to bend over to pick up my towel\n",
      "and that way I get the little extra exercise.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I'm always explaining to people, I do little things like that, like, you know, take the stairs instead of the, um, the elevator,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and, I do silly things like that versus a, a regular program that you would have.\n",
      "But that's,\n",
      "you're amazed at how much that adds up.\n",
      "It sure does.\n",
      "I was on, uh, Nutri Systems for a while,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, that is one of the things that they really stressed doing, you know,\n",
      "when you come to your Nutri System meeting, don't park in the parking place outside the front door, park at the other end, you know,\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I mean, and they stretched, stressed things like that too.\n",
      "You know, during, when you're sitting watching T V at night, during every commercial get up off the couch, go to the living room and get a glass of water, go to the bedroom and make the bed, go do something, but get up during every commercial. And, things like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "And, you'd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up, you know, just gives you a little more activity\n",
      "so,\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "especially when you're like us and don't really want to do it anyway.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I used to,\n",
      "I really did, uh, years ago\n",
      "and, uh, I was thinking about that not too long ago that I used to walk\n",
      "and not only did I walk\n",
      "but, I used to watch all those exercise programs on T V,\n",
      "and I would tape them,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and then I would do them like two times a day,\n",
      "but I don't do any of that kind of stuff anymore.\n",
      "I think having children everything just kind of, everything goes by the wayside.\n",
      "Well, I can't use that as an excuse because I didn't do it before\n",
      "I had mine either.\n",
      "I've never been,\n",
      "I just, I'm more into, you know, sitting, than I am\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Me too.\n",
      "so, but, you know, I have found that with,\n",
      "I have a two year old,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I have found really though, I'm kind of the opposite, I'm more active now with him, than I was before, because now, you know, he'll \"I want to go outside\" and I'll go outside with him\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and we'll walk up and down the street,\n",
      "and we'll go to the park\n",
      "and I'll run around with him and stuff like that,\n",
      "that,\n",
      "so I'm getting more, you know, more exercise that way than I ever did before I had him, you know.\n",
      "Um, um. Um, um.\n",
      "so, I think, I think that has helped a little bit,\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "Just chasing him around the house, you know, will be plenty for you.\n",
      "that's enough.\n",
      "Well, mine are older now, doing, uh, their own things\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "You've kind of gotten out of that little stage there.\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I have a thirteen year old and an eleven year old,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Oh, lucky you,\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "you're getting into even more interesting stages.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "We're actually going through the same stages the two year old and the teenager\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "you watch it'll be exactly the same\n",
      "Same thing, huh, it repeats, the terrible twos repeat at about thirteen\n",
      "It does,\n",
      "it, it absolutely does,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "How interesting, I can hardly wait\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, I, I know, I just know you can't.\n",
      "But, no,\n",
      "I don't get as much exercise as I used to\n",
      "but, I at least, since T I has implemented that program, I do,\n",
      "I'm more aware of it,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and, you know, that I'm need to do this, that and the other\n",
      "and, uh, so, I try to do combinations of things but not, like go down to the President's Health Club, like I see all these people do.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "That, that walkabout's a good program.\n",
      "It is,\n",
      "it is.\n",
      "It really is, you know,\n",
      "when they first started it, I, I got all the information, of course,\n",
      "but just like everything else, I was real gung ho with a friend of mine,\n",
      "\"Oh, we're going to do this, we're going to do this,\"\n",
      "and we did do it for a long time,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and then I started school, you know,\n",
      "Um, um.\n",
      "and like two nights a week I was going to school\n",
      "and then the other two nights a week my husband worked,\n",
      "so I had to pick Ryan up, you know,\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "there's always an excuse, you know, to not do it\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "so,\n",
      "And, it gets worse,\n",
      "it doesn't get any better.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "oh, I'm sure,\n",
      "I'm sure.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "because I'm constantly running my children around someplace\n",
      "and that's where I actually get my exercise, is running them from here to there, in the car.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "here to here,\n",
      "here,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "to the mall, to the movies, to the friends, to the,\n",
      "There you go,\n",
      "that's it,\n",
      "that's it.\n",
      "Sounds like fun.\n",
      "Well, it was nice talking to you.\n",
      "Well, it was really good to talk to you.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well okay,\n",
      "we'll talk to you later.\n",
      "Take care,\n",
      "talk to you later.\n",
      "Um, um.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "So, do you fish?\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "My dad has a lake cabin,\n",
      "and so we go there for the small lake, uh, just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area.\n",
      "It takes us about three hours to get there.\n",
      "And we go, and we fish,\n",
      "and we catch a bunch of junk Nothing, nothing to talk about for the most part,\n",
      "but it's fun.\n",
      "Uh, from a boat or from shore?\n",
      "From the dock, from shore.\n",
      "Oh, that's nice.\n",
      "Uh, mostly catfish\n",
      "or,\n",
      "Oh, mostly we catch carp.\n",
      "If we're doing good, we catch a catfish or two once in a while.\n",
      "And, you know, we go ahead and eat those.\n",
      "But we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry.\n",
      "What we normally do is just, uh, go ahead and clean it up, and then, uh, you know, put it in a bag and freeze it.\n",
      "And, and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd.\n",
      "Usually, there's a pretty good crowd there,\n",
      "so we don't ever catch enough to eat.\n",
      "Carp is usually pretty much fun.\n",
      "Because I've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little, you know, a little pole with twenty pound test line.\n",
      "And that, that's a pretty good fight.\n",
      "So that's a lot of fun.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "A real light line, real light rig?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, that sounds like fun.\n",
      "They fight hard.\n",
      "Fish in Colorado different than that.\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "Mostly trout in the mountains.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and in the rivers and stuff?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "mountain streams and rivers.\n",
      "Are they good to eat?\n",
      "Uh, yeah,\n",
      "very. Yeah, very much there, you know.\n",
      "Oh, you mean size wise they're not very big?\n",
      "Um, by and large, no.\n",
      "But, but they're big fun.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, I've been,\n",
      "is that mostly, uh, fly fishing when you're doing that\n",
      "or,\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Are you fly fishing\n",
      "or are you using a bobber?\n",
      "I, I, I'm a fly fisherman.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, I cast a ways.\n",
      "I'm not highly proficient,\n",
      "but it's fun.\n",
      "I've never even tried that.\n",
      "My,\n",
      "if I don't have a reel with a button on it, I tend to get so much backlash, it's not worth the trouble\n",
      "Well, let me explain fly, fly fishing to you then.\n",
      "You're not casting a weight on the end of the line?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "You're casting the weight of the line.\n",
      "With the little thing on the end.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well,  the fly on the end weighs nothing.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I thought it had a weight.\n",
      "It weighs less than the line.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "So what you do is, you strip off, oh, four, five, six little rolls, coils, of line into your hand.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And you whip the line.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "As you whip it, over your head,  or side to side, you slowly feed out more and more.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um. So you're fishing downstream so it will carry some?\n",
      "Well, no,\n",
      "no.\n",
      "You fish upstream.\n",
      "Oh, you fish upstream?\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And then you let it carry it downstream.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And then you reel it in,\n",
      "and you do it again.\n",
      "You hope that they think it's a bug and,  and eat it.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "exactly.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "exactly.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Jump at it.\n",
      "Uh, from what I'm seeing and hearing and all, the, the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern.\n",
      "That's a fish?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "no.\n",
      "It, it looks like a grub.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh, it's a, it's a lure.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "whenever you, yeah,\n",
      "a lure, a fly.\n",
      "I see.\n",
      "Whenever you have a, something that looks like something else\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it's a fly, you call it a pattern.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "All right, uh, you know, there's bumble bee patterns there's excuse me. Uh, there's bumble patterns, there's mosquito patterns, there's wasp patterns, there's grub patterns.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Uh,\n",
      "Did someone just come up with this design,\n",
      "and, and you're going to make one for yourself,\n",
      "Uh,\n",
      "or are you going to buy it?\n",
      "You can buy them.\n",
      "Uh, I've got some.\n",
      "And, They seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, it's just, that, that just happens to be what the fish like this year,\n",
      "huh?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "You know how that changes, the phase of the moon\n",
      "and,\n",
      "I guess so.\n",
      "We tend to use just bait. And, a few lures,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, I, You see, I'm from west Texas.\n",
      "but bait tends to work the best, just some blood bait.\n",
      "Oh, are you?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Where are you from?\n",
      "Lubbock.\n",
      "Oh, I'm from Midland.\n",
      "Oh, another west Texan.\n",
      "I went to college at Tech,\n",
      "so. You've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I've been up there.\n",
      "It, It, it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day.\n",
      "I didn't catch anything,\n",
      "but I've been up there\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's fun.\n",
      "It's lazy.\n",
      "Take a picnic lunch.\n",
      "I used to do that with my dad.\n",
      "Every once in a while we'd go out on a Saturday and just spend the day. Before it got too hot.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, there you fish mornings and evenings. And nights.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we do most of our fishing at night.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Just from the heat of it all.\n",
      "That's one advantage you've certainly got on us.\n",
      "It, at times, gets incredibly hot here.\n",
      "It does?\n",
      "I've only been up there once.\n",
      "In the summer. Well,\n",
      "no,\n",
      "I've been up there twice in the summer.\n",
      "But both times it was really pleasant.\n",
      "In fact, it snowed on us in, in, gosh, when was that?\n",
      "June?\n",
      "We were in Mesa Verde Park,\n",
      "and it was like the end of It was just before July fourth.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And it was twenty-eight, twenty-nine degrees.\n",
      "We were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags, not knowing any better\n",
      "And here it went and it froze,\n",
      "and it snowed on us.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We did not know what to do about it.\n",
      "Fishing is not just, just dragging fish out of the water.\n",
      "It's, it's a total experience, you know, getting out in nature and,  hearing the crickets, and listening to the birds and,  seeing the squirrels and,  camping out, and eating out,  of doors\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Do,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Do you have to,\n",
      "do you wear waders when you fish?\n",
      "Uh, I probably ought to.\n",
      "I just freeze.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Goodness, it must be a little bit cold.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "well, you know,  ankle deep or standing on the bank, and slipping it out there.\n",
      "That's cold water around there.\n",
      "Um. Do you have any,\n",
      "You know, I always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it,  out there,\n",
      "Oh, I see.\n",
      "and you know how it is.\n",
      "The water's kind of,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And you get, you get a little more carried away with it,\n",
      "and you move a little closer.\n",
      "And then you're in to it just a little bit,\n",
      "and then you splash in\n",
      "and,  the next thing you know, your knees are wet.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Do you have any kids that you take fishing?\n",
      "Uh, got a stepdaughter.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "She's real sweet.\n",
      "And, uh, at times she enjoys it, at times not.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "A fuzzy little dog.\n",
      "I have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And the little one, of course, is, could care less.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "The, uh, three and a half year old has just gotten to the point,\n",
      "we got him a little pole last year,\n",
      "and just put, uh, his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up\n",
      "That was what he considered fishing\n",
      "This year, he's gotten to where he can.\n",
      "We, we were at a friend's, uh, stock pond, we were out at their farm,\n",
      "and, and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And he started trying to cast it.\n",
      "So, he, he was kind of getting there\n",
      "but he's, He's at a dangerous point right now\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "you guys sure want to be out of range.\n",
      "He understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw, but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in.\n",
      "It takes time.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Last year, we had a, oh, just a wonderful trip up to Travers Lake. * Trapper's Lake in Colorado?\n",
      "Oh, it was cold, and rain the whole time.\n",
      "And we still had a good time out,  of the deal.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, that's good.\n",
      "Uh, and Colorado is a beautiful place to live.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "My husband would like to live there,\n",
      "but I don't know. All of our family is here\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Well, and you've got to have,\n",
      "you've got to work for a living.\n",
      "Well, yeah,\n",
      "but T I is up there,\n",
      "so that part of it would probably work out\n",
      "What division you all in?\n",
      "I'm sorry, what?\n",
      "What division are you all in?\n",
      "We're both, uh,\n",
      "I was, uh, military,\n",
      "but he's division three.\n",
      "It goes back and forth.\n",
      "Division, well,\n",
      "maybe division one right now.\n",
      "He's in computers.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "Well, the only thing up here,  is division one.\n",
      "And he's in school,  and everything else.\n",
      "I have some friends who work up there.\n",
      "Oh, yeah?\n",
      "Kathy and Kevin Guy.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And they like to fish.\n",
      "They've been inviting us to come up there in the summer.\n",
      "Her dad has a cabin,\n",
      "and they go fishing, up there.\n",
      "Oh, fishing's,  fishing is fun up here.\n",
      "So that would be neat to,  try it some time.\n",
      "It's not,\n",
      "It seems like the success ratio, the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there.\n",
      "But it is fun.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "You know,  The, the experience is, is better up here, I think.\n",
      "long as you have a good time, that's the main point\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "You know, it seems more relaxing, there's more to look at.\n",
      "Definitely more to look at.\n",
      "And, and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul You know, if you're, if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "The only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up.\n",
      "We camped next to one, one time when we were there a couple of summers ago.\n",
      "And we figured we were up a long way off.\n",
      "And then it rained that night,\n",
      "and we thought, well, wonder how far off we are?\n",
      "And we got up the next day,\n",
      "and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away\n",
      "And it's like, oh, well, maybe we ought to move just a touch.\n",
      "So, that was kind of funny.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it, it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I just love the way it looks.\n",
      "I could almost just watch the\n",
      "we, in fact, we have gotten out on, on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much,\n",
      "and if you were there. I mean,\n",
      "it was,\n",
      "one time we were there,\n",
      "and I guess it was late May,\n",
      "so it was really your spring almost,  you know, at, even though it was, it was really summer down here.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, and the, I guess the creek, the mountains were really starting to melt,\n",
      "and the creek was just wild, just running.\n",
      "And, and all the white water and noise and the,\n",
      "it was just beautiful.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "it gets foamy almost.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And you know it's just pure and pristine. And the froth\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Okay, um,\n",
      "I have two children\n",
      "and they're older now,\n",
      "but, um, I found it very difficult to find good child care when I was looking for a place to for stay while I thought school,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, um, I wanted when they were very young when they were babies say till they were about two years old I preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home\n",
      "and that's what I looked for\n",
      "and I was lucky enough to find one right across from my school,\n",
      "and that worked.\n",
      "Well, that's good.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that worked out real well\n",
      "but when they got older I wanted them to be in a school type situation, three, I think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and,  and be around kids their own age because I think that's that, that would prepare them for school also, it's real important ,  that they do that, um, that they get that preparation for school,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so\n",
      "but I had,\n",
      "I have switched schools several times because I, I really didn't care for what was going on at that the school.\n",
      "I wanted them to learn to play I didn't academics forced on them at an early age.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, um,\n",
      "that, that's,\n",
      "oh, oh, you mean you switched schools for the kids.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "for the for the kids.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "well, I'm just recently married.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So I don't have any children. Though we plan on having them soon\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "but I think, um, that I, that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties, uh,\n",
      "I think, um, I'm lucky though that, um, my wife will probably not have to work while our children,  are under four,  or five.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Wonderful.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I'm a college professor,\n",
      "Oh,\n",
      "so,\n",
      "great.\n",
      "and that's also,\n",
      "and it's nice for me because, um, most of the time you have so, so much flexible hours so that I could probably work two or three days a week,  and then one or two evenings,  so that if my wife does, um, does go back to work part time, um, there probably will be a possibility that I could stay home two days that she would go to work and that I would have to teach at night.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "Oh that's, wonderful.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "so it will probably workout real nice for us, uh,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules,\n",
      "That's wonderful.\n",
      "I can even teach on Saturdays and,  and things, like that.\n",
      "Oh,\n",
      "great,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "um, I do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding, uh, child care,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and one of the things they made in, um, uh,\n",

      "So,  they, um, um,\n",
      "my sister-in-law is a, uh, um, a clinical speech pathologist,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so, she is\n",
      "I guess her most recent position after she returned back to work, she applied for a director's position and got it.\n",
      "So, I guess she's very well qualified for her field I guess\n",
      "and even though she took off two years for, um,\n",
      "I guess four years all together,\n",

      "Oh, dear.\n",
      "And, and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school.\n",
      "Sure,\n",
      "yeah.\n",

      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so she was probably twenty-seven when they were married,\n",

      "Yep.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and I knew my kids were being taken,  care of.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and, uh, plus I, I, uh, wanted them to get something out of it,  I just didn't want it to be a day where they went and slept and ate cookies and,  that's it .\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "that,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "that's, you know, that's so important I, um, I, I guess it's so funny now with schools, you know, they don't take kid into kindergarten, and when, I guess when they're five,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and sometimes they flunk kindergarten now.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "They don't let them into kindergarten unless they can count to ten and know their A B C\n",
      "and I think that's so funny because, um, I don't, I don't know if I want\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "and I,\n",
      "it's a very important part of your life\n",
      "and I hope to read with my kids,\n",
      "but I don't know if I want my kids to go to school. At four,  or three,\n",
      "Well.\n",
      "I agree with that.\n",
      "you know, I can see that when you make that point.\n",
      "Well, the thing is,  I teach this grade and I, I can see very readily the kids that didn't never learn socially how to get along with other,  children\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically,  because they were not, they're should be, there's to many things in their way, *to should be too\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yep,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "and so I want my\n",
      "I wanted my children\n",
      "and they did learn to get, to get along with other people.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "that's a really important point.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and I mean I feel a lot of maladjusted adults\n",
      "and I bet if we trace back to their,  early childhood we could see some, you know, times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with,  people.\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "I think that's really, that's important\n",
      "I, I've seen the same thing\n",
      "I, I think you're exactly right because, you know, I've gone\n",
      "or\n",
      "before I was married I went out with a girl,\n",
      "and you know, um, boy, after, you know, after about two months I realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I bet,\n",
      "and they could be traced back to just not being, uh, you know, being moved between day care centers when she was one and two and three years old,  and never, always being a bit snippy and spiteful.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I bet you could trace all the way back\n",
      "I bet you could too,  because it, you know, kids have to learn how to get along with other people,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and if they don't they just don't turn out to be really, you know, good adults or,  successful adults I should say,\n",
      "That's true,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "you know, really\n",
      "but, uh, it is a big problem\n",
      "and you I have lot of friends right now that, uh, have young children\n",
      "and they daily have problems with, with whoever is taking care of the child,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "or they switch a lot, which is not good for the child either.\n",
      "Yep,\n",
      "that's true.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's really true.\n",
      "So you need,\n",
      "cause you need that consistency when they're young like that,\n",
      "and it would be ideal like you, you hope when you have children,  your wife gets to stay home,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I would have, have given anything if I would have been able,  to stay home with my children.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, I think I'm, I'm very lucky.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "you.\n",
      "Um, because of having, you know, flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I teach a computer classes\n",
      "so,  it's, it's one of things where I'm paid a little bit better then a History or an English professor\n",
      "Oh, great.\n",
      "and I'm also, um, you know,\n",
      "they have vocational type courses on weekends,  almost everywhere,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, you know, you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a Saturday,  which means,  that, you know, whole week's worth of courses\n",
      "Oh, that's,  wonderful.\n",
      "so that lets you be available three days during the week,  you know,\n",
      "Oh, great.\n",
      "so you be will home with your kids I you know\n",
      "it's really funny is that I, I picked this career when I was in college because, uh, I think with my commitment to family and, um,  wanting to spend more time with my children,  because my dad had very, um, nine to five type job,  with, uh, forty-five minute commute into the city, and a forty-five commute home,\n",
      "Um.   You're very wise.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so, by the time he got home he was so tired\n",
      "and he was all rung out from the day,\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "and I think he, he missed a lot of, um, our up bringing.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "You know, my mother\n",
      "I, I came from a family, that my mother stayed home until we started school.\n",
      "Uh-huh.  thirteen and a sixteen year old.\n",
      "Um, and I, I don't, uh,\n",
      "It's probably costing you a fortune.\n",
      "Oh it is,\n",
      "they really are expensive,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "My goodness, if, if you want them to be able to drive the car, the insurance bill.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "um,\n",
      "Well, and they\n",
      "most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "So, you know, right now I'm looking for a little truck for my for my son,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so that you know an older, older, older, truck\n",
      "so I can afford it,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but, you know, I, I just look forward to him helping me out because I for years just car,  drove in carpools all over the place\n",
      "Carpools, uh,\n",
      "and, And it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store, will you take his sister somewhere,  something like that.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "my parents did a lot of that.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "And just to save you trips to and from,  you know, uh, ball games and athletic events,  and activities at the school.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "exactly.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "isn't that something how, you know, you think about child care\n",
      "and it lasts along time. *along a long\n",
      "It, does for ever.\n",
      "It, it lasts a long time.\n",
      "And then when you get through with your own you've got grandchildren,\n",
      "so\n",
      "It's not ending is it\n",
      "You think we've talked a long, a long enough time?\n",
      "Oh, they come in, see this is the first time I've done this.\n",
      "Oh, in ten minutes, you have to talk that long.\n",
      "Well, you don't have to\n",
      "but they,  they,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "um, you go the length\n",
      "and sometimes if it's a very busy time period you'll go about seven minutes.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Depends on how old the tapes are at that time.\n",
      "I see.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I see.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Are you from the,\n",

      "Oh, my gosh, I'm from, uh, Plano, Texas which is, which is outside of Dallas.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, most of most of the people I talk to are from Texas.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "because that's where T I is\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "and I've discussed,  I've discussed, um.\n",
      "That makes sense.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Guess we can go ahead.\n",
      "Uh, well, I guess you know it's, you know,\n",
      "since living in Dallas it's always so hot, so in the summertime, I just, I wear lots of shorts, so because I don't work during the day.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, do you work?\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "uh-huh,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I do work.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Uh, and,\n",
      "but I work at a manufacturing plant,\n",
      "so I wear a lot of blue jeans,  and T-shirts.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But occasionally I have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress,  and high heel shoes\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I feel really uncomfortable doing that\n",
      "and,  in the plant so, uh, it's, it's a problem for me.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, normally I just wear blue jeans and a T-shirt.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Very, very, comfortable.\n",
      "I like that so much better than having to wear dress clothes.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "and buying suits and stuff, yeah, because just being at home\n",
      "and, I work at home,\n",
      "so,  I just have, you know, I just wear my, you know, my shorts and stuff like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I don't go out and spend lots of money on, uh, different, you know, suits and stuff, you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "But when I,\n",
      "before I got married, you know, I was working\n",
      "so I, uh, you know, I had more suits and stuff then\n",
      "but,\n",
      "Right\n",
      "Worry about all that kind of stuff\n",
      "Well, I have plenty of suits and dress clothes because I'm like you, when I first started working,  uh, I have all these suits and blouses and skirts and mix and match, and that kind of stuff\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but now that I, you know, work in the manufacturing plant, then it's just, it's so much more difficult for me to, to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh, but occasionally I have to because, uh, part of my job is teaching,  and training,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal,  garb\n",
      "When you're training, right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Than your normal garb\n",
      "But I'm like you, too, uh, I moved from Ohio down to here\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "moved from,  Winter.\n",
      "and I had mostly polyesters and,  wools and winter clothes and buying all these cotton clothes,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and then, of course, you have to iron them all the time.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That's really,\n",
      "that's been a problem for me.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "because I came from Wyoming\n",
      "and I had wool suits and wool skirts\n",
      "and, You know, I've got all these clothes that I never wear,  because you can't wear them here.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And, uh, the seasons are just so much different.\n",
      "You have so much summer.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, so then when I, you know, I finally get a chance to go out with my husband it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear\n",
      "That's true, that's true.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Well, I know, I was just now, uh, uh, putting away a lot of my winter clothes,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I was going through here\n",
      "and I was thinking, I haven't worn this in three years.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, because it's a wool skirt\n",
      "and there's just not that many opportunities to wear it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And I have five or six wool skirts,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so I was thinking well, maybe, you know, I need to think about getting rid of them,\n",
      "but no, I folded it up neatly and put it away maybe next year\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You hate to get rid of it, because you know how much you spent on them.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "And it's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff, I know.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "Well, I know last year, uh, well, this past winter, it wasn't that cold.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But the previous winter we had more, uh, cold weather where I was able to actually wear,  your double and triple layerings of, uh, clothes yeah, like you would when you're up north.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Clothes,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "So  that's really interesting.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "and I, I just don't spend, you know,\n",
      "right now my clothes come from Target, you know\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "yes,\n",
      "yes,\n",
      "and they're all one hundred percent cotton\n",
      "and\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "and they,\n",
      "you take them out of the drier\n",
      "and they're wadded up in a ball.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "yes,\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Oh\n",
      "I'm so glad to meet somebody that, that their iron board is their permanent fixture in their house.\n",
      "It is, it is.\n",
      "You know, I have very little furniture,\n",
      "but my ironing board is part of my decor\n",
      "so,\n",
      "That's true,\n",
      "and, and I've been looking at these, uh, uh, like in Home Depot where you can go and they've got, that ironing boards that will just flip right down off of the uh, uh, what, the, the, the door.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh,\n",
      "and then you can actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall, you know, to have it,  permanently attached,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and that's what I'm thinking I'm going to have to do because mine's sitting right out in front of my bedroom\n",
      "and it's just, it's just an eyesore, I think,  with all the,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, yeah\n",
      "it is, it is,\n",
      "but it's like, uh, I just don't want to do it\n",
      "Uh-uh,\n",
      "uh-uh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "I've been thinking about putting the ironing board in the closet,  and, and running, you know, a line in there for my iron so I could do it in there\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I wouldn't have to have that eyesore\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "that's an idea.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, I have a big closet.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, you know,\n",
      "if I have,\n",
      "if I know I'm having somebody come over to the house and there's a possibility they might be going back into my room,  I will put it away,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "but I iron our clothes as we go along,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so, you know,\n",
      "I no longer do that weekly thing,  because I have so many,\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "no.\n",
      "and I'm like you,  I, the night before or that day, I will iron whatever it is that we need\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and that's it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Because it's too many,\n",
      "hundred percent cotton.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "You can't iron it all\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And then with my kids, they're always getting into, you know,\n",
      "they can't decide what they want to wear so they,  change their minds, you know, I know, I mean my oldest is only four,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but she's still changes her mind two or three times,  before she figures out what she's going to wear\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Oh, I know, I know.\n",
      "And then they never put anything back.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "no\n",
      "of course not.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "that, uh, that would be too simple.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "Absolutely not\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Our lot in life is to make her life miserable\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "absolutely, absolutely.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well that's,\n",
      "it's been good talking to you, to see somebody, hear somebody that does the same thing I do because I tell people what I do\n",
      "and they just go, oh, how do you do that?\n",
      "It's like, it's easy, you just do it, you know.\n",
      "That's right\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, uh,\n",
      "but, yeah,\n",
      "I, uh, I know several of my girlfriends, though, we, uh, we all keep our ironing boards out and just, uh, an ever present thing in our household\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "I don't think I'd know what to do if it wasn't there, you know.\n",
      "My husband wouldn't know where to hang his dirty clothes.\n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "You know.\n",
      "Things that need to be mended,  things that have to get ironed,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "He wouldn't know where to put things\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Oh, well, it was nice talking with you.\n",
      "Oh, it was nice talking with you, too.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "take care.\n",
      "Take care.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "bye-bye.\n",
      "So eating out.\n",
      "What are you interested in in restaurants?\n",
      "Right, uh.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "Uh, once a week, twice a week?\n",
      "Oh, at least once a week.\n",
      "We're, we're retired now.\n",
      "When we working out we ate out more than that\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I understand.\n",
      "Uh, but we both work\n",
      "and we have a daughter,\n",
      "and we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway.\n",
      "Well, what type of restaurant do you like, Richard?\n",
      "Uh, really, I'm kind of open on food.\n",
      "I'm what you might call a culinary adventurer.\n",
      "I'll, uh, try anything once.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Been on a real barbecue kick lately.\n",
      "Oh have you?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We like Chinese.\n",
      "We eat, a lot of Chinese food.\n",
      "Excuse me. Uh, yeah,\n",
      "we usually have Chinese once a month.\n",
      "What do you look for in a restaurant?\n",
      "I hate franchised restaurants.\n",
      "You what?\n",
      "You,\n",
      "I despise franchised restaurants.\n",
      "Oh I,\n",
      "I, I, I always prefer to go to something that seems more family run. Uh, some place where you seem to have the attitude like you're going into their home for dinner almost.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I know what you mean.\n",
      "I like some ambiance,\n",
      "and I like good food.\n",
      "I don't like fast food hamburgers and all of that.\n",
      "I don't,\n",
      "but I don't like something fake or put on either.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "You know, if I could have a good small restaurant or a good large restaurant I'd go to the good small restaurant.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I don't know why that is.\n",
      "I think it's probably due to pricing, often.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "I don't care to go to a place just for the price of it\n",
      "Well, yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I mean, it's like continental French restaurant or something really with high prices\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and seven courses isn't what I usually look for\n",
      "It is what you look for?\n",
      "Oh, isn't, isn't.\n",
      "Uh, I try to get my money's worth.\n",
      "Right\n",
      "And not just that, I try to, well, that's a big part of it. I try to get my money's worth. You know, and not just in quantity, you know, but quality, and, and flavor and texture and care.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Presentation\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Well, presentation's not always all of it either.\n",
      "Well, like we, we've been eating some in a restaurant that that just changed hands recently,\n",
      "It's, it's important.\n",
      "and we're trying to give them a little patronage.\n",
      "But Sunday we went there,\n",
      "and I had a pretty good meal of grilled pork chops and a baked apple and potatoes.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So I said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce, something like that\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "something a little extra\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's what I mean by,\n",
      "and just for color if nothing else.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "It would mean a lot to the looks of the plate.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "What I miss up here is, I'm originally a Texan, and I miss home cooked Mexican.\n",
      "Tex-Mex, Tex-Mex.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "home cooked Tex-Mex.\n",
      "Uh, Mexican restaurants where it's not owned by an Anglo or a corporation.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Uh, we have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico,\n",
      "and we've really gotten to like,\n",
      "we like the real Mexican food better than Tex-Mex.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, there's real Mexican food\n",
      "and there's real Tex-Mex Mexican, you know, by third or fourth generation Americans of Hispanic heritage.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "It's all pretty good, isn't it?\n",
      "Oh, yes,\n",
      "and, and there's big differences, of course,\n",
      "and, of course, when you talk about Mexican cuisine you, that's kind of like talking about American food or Chinese food, in because its regional, too.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "uh-huh,\n",
      "that's true.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "I'm originally from Maine,\n",
      "so we like seafood, too.\n",
      "And that's something we don't get here,\n",
      "and we're in the mountains in Virginia.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And most of the seafood's frozen.\n",
      "Uh, yeah\n",
      "that's the way it is here in Colorado, also.\n",
      "No fresh, or almost no fresh seafood\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and in Texas we got it from the Gulf.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "that's true.\n",
      "Lots of shrimp.\n",
      "And, yeah,\n",
      "here a couple years ago my wife and I went to Seattle on vacation.\n",
      "And I think everything except breakfast was seafood for almost a week.\n",
      "I know it\n",
      "And it was,\n",
      "I was like a man starving at every meal.\n",
      "I know the feeling.\n",
      "We do the same thing.\n",
      "My son-in-law is a Texan,\n",
      "and when he goes to Maine, he eats lobster, I guess, at least twice a day, all the time he's up there\n",
      "It's a lot cheaper there, isn't it?\n",
      "Lobster?\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "It's like two ninety-eight a pound for a pound lobster.\n",
      "It's like shrimp on the Gulf.\n",
      "Two ninety-eight a pound.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's as cheap as steaks some places I mean in a grocery store.\n",
      "Oh yeah,\n",
      "cheaper,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "A lot of the restaurants you can get two two one pound lobsters for like ten ninety-nine.\n",
      "Oh, my gosh.\n",
      "I've got to go to Maine then rattling in\n",
      "You may have sold a trip for some time.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's a good place to go.\n",
      "Uh, it sounds wonderful.\n",
      "Uh, so,\n",
      "Lots of little restaurants, too, with home cooked food, that's up there.\n",
      "That sound good.\n",
      "Uh, down in the Gulf I've eaten a bunch of those little uh, seafood shacks, we've called them.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, it's just so much different than to eat something that's been frozen. You know\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "We went to\n",
      "shrimp straight out of the bay.\n",
      "We were in Galveston last year right well, the first of this year, actually.\n",
      "Hm.\n",
      "And, ate in a restaurant,\n",
      "and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the Gulf coast.\n",
      "Was it true?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "It wasn't.\n",
      "On the way across Louisiana, we pulled off, we saw a billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place.\n",
      "And they had,\n",
      "it was a small restaurant, just kind of out of the way,\n",
      "and they were set up with two buffets, one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything. And then one complete seafood buffet.\n",
      "Hm.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "That was the best shrimp I have ever had in my life.\n",
      "They had shrimp fixed probably six different ways.\n",
      "Uh, yes,\n",
      "the cajuns.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "It was wonderful.\n",
      "They can, they can do things to shrimp that, that no one else can.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, have you eaten crawfish yet?\n",
      "Uh, I tried it,\n",
      "but I didn't care for it.\n",
      "Not there, but at my brothers I tried it.\n",
      "Oh, as with anything, it's preparation.\n",
      "That's probably true.\n",
      "It,\n",
      "We just,\n",
      "he went down and bought some at a local place that steams them, just so we'd try them.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It,\n",
      "there's all kinds,\n",
      "Probably needed some cold beer with it\n",
      "and\n",
      "So you do eat out a lot.\n",
      "Quite a bit.\n",
      "One of our other real problems with going out to eat, Sunday morning brunches.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "You know, Sunday brunch, all, all you can eat brunches.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "We used to do that, once in a while,\n",
      "but we don't anymore.\n",
      "Uh, we still find it fun.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's fun,\n",
      "but it's just so much food\n",
      "Hate to come away feeling uncomfortable\n",
      "Well, I work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor.\n",
      "Do you,\n",
      "well that makes a difference.\n",
      "And so,\n",
      "Where do you go to brunches?\n",
      "Like at hotels, or restaurants there?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh, actually one of our, one of our favorites is a chain. Shoney's.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "We eat at Shoney's.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "in spite of the fact I've spoken so badly about chains, chain restaurants, uh, we, uh, do like Shoney's pretty well,\n",
      "but then there's a place up the pass, up in the mountains that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings, drive, drive up to, I think it's about eight thousand foot elevation. And, and drive through Woodland Park and go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "that sounds nice.\n",
      "It, it, it's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "I imagine it is.\n",
      "I think it's as much the, the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch.\n",
      "You know, and it's not that far.\n",
      "It's thirty miles.\n",
      "out of, which direction?\n",
      "Colorado Springs.\n",
      "Out of, which direction from there?\n",
      "West\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "west out of Colorado Springs.\n",
      "What are your favorite programs?\n",
      "Uh, it's kind of hard to put my finger on a, on a favorite T V program,\n",
      "however, uh, one that I've been watching for a number of years is DALLAS.\n",
      "And, uh, And, uh, it's going to be going off the air, uh, let's see, a week from a week from tonight.\n",
      "Oh, how funny.\n",
      "It's going to be its last show.\n",
      "So I've, I've kind of enjoyed watching over the years.\n",
      "I've been disappointed in it and also pleased in it.\n",
      "And, uh, I was, uh, greatly disappointed, uh, when I did move down to Plano to, uh, find out that the, uh, the, uh, great South Fork Ranch was really only a one bedroom house.\n",
      "I've seen the sign that goes to there.\n",
      "I've,\n",
      "well I think I've seen it in the distance.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But I have not even seen it.\n",
      "And I have not seen the program.\n",
      "Oh well, That's a shame.\n",
      "So\n",
      "And, and, uh, I know when we went to London, it was really funny.\n",
      "Uh, people recognized Dallas, Texas, by the, the Texas, uh, the, the cowboys and by that program.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "And that's, that's the two things they associate with Dallas, Texas.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "I,\n",
      "and I,\n",
      "they asked me, uh,\n",
      "several times, several times they ask me, why are there two bridges?\n",
      "And I didn't know what they were talking about.\n",
      "It took me a long time, they're talking about the viaducts.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Is that,\n",
      "that is right, isn't it?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Because they ask me, why are there two bridges going into Dallas?\n",
      "Darned if I know\n",
      "I was blank looking, you know.\n",
      "I felt really dumb.\n",
      "Well, it's, it's, uh,\n",
      "when you look at the, uh, you know, route seventy-five, coming down there. I mean, it's actually a bridge,\n",
      "but it's a bridge over top of roadway.\n",
      "There's no water there. I mean, uh,\n",
      "Well, there's water in the Trinity.\n",
      "I thought it was to, going to Oak Cliff over the Trinity.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well there's, there, uh,\n",
      "well they,\n",
      "I think when they open the show up they give you two different views of Dallas.\n",
      "Oh, do they?\n",
      "One from the east and one from the west.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "And that's why.\n",
      "Oh, I see.\n",
      "But it kind of confuses people.\n",
      "But, uh, uh, I enjoy, uh, uh, a lot of different comedies.\n",
      "Um, I think it's mainly for an escape, um, you know, you, uh, my job is not the most thrilling in the world\n",
      "and, uh, I enjoy laughing and, uh, some of the shows that, uh, are on the air, some are just purely, you know, brain drainers.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And then there's other ones that, uh, deal with, uh, in a funny manner, uh, socially relevant things.\n",
      "And, uh, one show that comes to mind is like DESIGNING WOMEN. Uh,\n",
      "I think that is just a hoot.\n",
      "That's one of those few that I do watch when the television is on.\n",
      "My husband likes to watch T V.\n",
      "It's on.\n",
      "I usually read and watch T V.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But that's one of the few that I just actually watch.\n",
      "Because it's funny.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I really enjoy that one.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "It, uh, it has been very entertaining\n",
      "and, and also, uh, the, the issues they deal with, uh, really tends to open, open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems.\n",
      "And, uh, I've, I've really enjoyed that one since it came on.\n",
      "Um, I don't like the politics surrounding the program though,\n",
      "but, I mean, other than that, you know, there seems to be a little in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses.\n",
      "But, uh,\n",
      "and then, uh, I've kind of gotten hooked on P B S stuff, uh, public, uh, T V.\n",
      "Uh, I like things like NOVA and, uh, some of the, the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff.\n",
      "I just enjoy watching that stuff.\n",
      "Now, we watch a lot of those.\n",
      "Uh, and the ones that sometimes will hook me, to put down my book, will be the one, there was one, uh, recently about the Gettysburg Address.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And they wrapped a fictional story around it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I thought that was well done.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, and it, it caught my attention.\n",
      "I wound up watching the whole thing.\n",
      "Uh, I guess the awards ceremonies, and there seems to be dozens of them per year.\n",
      "Maybe I've spent two minutes watching to see what they on and if they make a fool of themselves or not\n",
      "But they could take that whole collection\n",
      "and it would disappear\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I, I, particularly take issue with those.\n",
      "I, I really dislike those.\n",
      "Well I'm one of those rare guys, who, I, I rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event, um, if ever watch one.\n",
      "Uh, there's just not that much I'm, I'm interested in.\n",
      "Um, for a while, I, I, I watched some football,\n",
      "but I've just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit around and, and watch a baseball game.\n",
      "You know, my husband used to just be riveted to the Dallas Cowboys.\n",
      "And now, we're out running around,\n",
      "and if they're, if they're playing, he'll turn it on while we're in the car to see what the score is,\n",
      "and he'll listen.\n",
      "But, even I've said, hey look, you're fascinated with this, you sit and listen to the Cowboys.\n",
      "Let me run in here,\n",
      "and I'll do some things\n",
      "and I'll come back\n",
      "and you don't have to miss, he'll say, na, na, na.\n",
      "And he doesn't, he doesn't watch it.\n",
      "He like I say,\n",
      "if it's convenient he'll listen to it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But he just doesn't watch them on T V like he used to.\n",
      "Well I think it was great when they were, you know, like world champs and they were doing real well.\n",
      "I, uh, I\n",
      "personally, I, I came from the Washington area.\n",
      "And so I was a big Washington Redskins fan.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "Oh, those people.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "And, uh, when I came down to Dallas, it was, uh, you know, I found myself rooting for the home team.\n",
      "I, uh,\n",
      "in fact I have a, uh, a baseball hat that was signed by Tony Dorsett and Hershel Walker the only year they played together on the Dallas Cowboys.\n",
      "Oh, how neat.\n",
      "Well, I actually got to go see them win in the Super Bowl when they went down to New Orleans.\n",
      "Oh, wow.\n",
      "And, I, I, I make the trip and did the whole New Orleans before the game and the game and everything\n",
      "and,  uh, that was, that was a lot of fun.\n",
      "But, I don't know, I haven't been as,\n",
      "I'll tell you what I love to watch. And this is not, this is rarely on television.\n",
      "But what is a lot of fun to go attend, is this arena football.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I like it so much better than straight football.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I haven't seen that.\n",
      "It, it doesn't,\n",
      "it has a lot of different rules.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "The field is half the size\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and there's no,\n",
      "they can't call time and things like that.\n",
      "It moves a lot faster.\n",
      "uh. Gee, I'll have to try to catch that sometime.\n",
      "It's,\n",
      "Uh, again I think it may be on cable more than anything else.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "We  don't have cable.\n",
      "that's probably true.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we don't either.\n",
      "I, uh, I couldn't rationalize paying, you know,\n",
      "it's like if I pay for a movie channel, then I have watch what movies they want me to watch when they want me to watch them.\n",
      "And if I, you know, if I didn't use cable for anything else other than the basic, well I can get that for free.\n",
      "And well, I really don't need C N N, I see enough bad news all the time.\n",
      "I don't need to see more of it.\n",
      "So I, I've kind of, uh, rationalized that it's, it's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see.\n",
      "Well,\n",
      "And of course when we were living in Texas, it was real convenient with Tom Thumb.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "You know, having movies, uh, back then it was ninety-nine cents.\n",
      "I mean, go,\n",
      "They're everywhere, they're on every corner.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Everything you've ever wanted to see.\n",
      "Um. You can see them a lot sooner than you can see them on any of the stations like H B O or Cinemax.\n",
      "Well, and I like to rent tapes because you can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Or it becomes snack time for various reasons.\n",
      "You can put, you know,\n",
      "the only thing, this DANCE WITH WOLVES, I want to see it in a theater.\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "I do too.\n",
      "Because I understand that, that your, you'll lose fifty percent of it if you don't.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And I, uh, I've been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it.\n",
      "She, she doesn't like going to movie theaters because usually they're dirty,\n",
      "and, uh, you know, she just doesn't like them.\n",
      "And, um, she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie.\n",
      "And I've told her, you know, everybody I know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick.\n",
      "That's what I hear too.\n",
      "And, uh, so I'm, I'm hoping I can get her talked into it soon.\n",
      "Well, my husband smokes.\n",
      "He's one of the dinosaurs that still smokes.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "And you can't smoke in movie theaters.\n",
      "And that has really slowed down the forward progress of going to movies.\n",
      "But I haven't really cared up until this point.\n",
      "But I,\n",
      "we are this weekend going to go see DANCE WITH WOLVES.\n",
      "It's,\n",
      "that's it.\n",
      "We will do it.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "finally.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But as, as far as, uh, regular T V shows, I mean, I've got some, some shows that, that, that I would be afraid to admit to you that I've actually sat down and watched\n",
      "And then there's, there's others that, uh, uh, I wish I had time to see.\n",
      "It's like I enjoy watching CHEERS.\n",
      "It's very funny.\n",
      "Some of the things in it are mindless,\n",
      "but I, I just don't have time to watch it.\n",
      "Um, I think about the only night that I really sit in front of the T V set all night long probably is on Monday night.\n",
      "Because, um, I work so hard over the weekend, doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on Monday.\n",
      "Monday night I'm just worn out.\n",
      "So I kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and, and look over things.\n",
      "And I can sit in front of the T V set and look at, you know, do, go through my mail and, and watch T V at the same time.\n",
      "Well, I tend,\n",
      "my job tends to be very demanding.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And to sit down and to mindlessly either read or just mindlessly stare in absolute comfort isn't as bad as it used to,\n",
      "I'm actually at work.\n",
      "Oh,\n",
      "I'm in facilities and happen to have, uh, weekend duty here.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "What building do you work in?\n",
      "I'm in the South Building.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "We, we pull mostly evenings.\n",
      "We are having,\n",
      "there's three of us, uh, facilities' managers are covering the off shifts. Just to have somebody here, uh, from management to, uh, see if they need anything.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Oh, the,\n",
      "how many calls have you made?\n",
      "I've only made a few.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Um,\n",
      "I'm, uh, getting close to twenty.\n",
      "This is the,\n",
      "yeah, hopefully you have a lot to talk about in this one,\n",
      "but I don't really have a lot in this one.\n",
      "Usually I can talk for hours on most of the subjects they pick .\n",
      "Go ahead, you first\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "our topic for today is invasion of privacy.\n",
      "So, I got a good one.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "good.\n",
      "When the phone rings and you've got a recording, and this always happens like around five or six o'clock,  at night. It rings and you get this recording\n",
      "Okay, yeah.\n",
      "and then it won't go away\n",
      "and any, any of the type of solicitation that, where they call all the time, you know.\n",
      "There are evenings especially Friday nights, Thursday and Friday nights.\n",
      "Well, we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night.\n",
      "More people call, that's where you want to jerk the phone out of the wall, you know, your sitting down to eat and the phone rings\n",
      "and,  it's like, I don't want anything, thank you very much\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I,\n",
      "the worst one, I guess, is like you, when it's a recording. I I don't mind so much someone calls\n",
      "and it's a, and it's a salesperson, at least you can chat or whatever and say, okay, now, we want to go\n",
      "and then when, when they actually start off with a, a computer,  and expect you to talk to a computer, uh, that's where I draw the I just hang up immediately, you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Uh, shut my other radio off here\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's, that's real irritating to me.\n",
      "Uh, I guess they get their\n",
      "I'm, I'm amazed the question about that the,\n",
      "my concern would be everyone seems to have an answering machine\n",
      "and I have one too,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long, if they catch your answering machine,\n",
      "They can leave their whole spiel on it.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they, they can erase all your others, you know, because if you have,\n",
      "I think that's the way it is, no, mine, I guess, if it's full, it will not take it, I'm not sure.\n",
      "But they can certainly, uh, block your answering machine so someone else calls you, uh, and your answering machine is full, you know,  it won't erase.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "I,\n",
      "But your right. *your you're\n",
      "That was a good one.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "that's, that's a high irritant for me.\n",
      "Drives me crazy.\n",
      "And it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not because a lot of times these computer things will just make up numbers at random and just call them.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And so it really, really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not, you know, you have a unlisted number or not.\n",
      "And they pass around, uh, cards that have everybody's name on it.\n",
      "Like if you order something through a mail order catalog,  you know, then you'll start getting a bunch of stuff in. And a bunch of stuff and a bunch of stuff because they sell their customer list,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "or they sell their catalog list of people,  to different companies and everything.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but it's, uh, annoyance for me in the office with, uh, speaker phones.\n",
      "You know, I,\n",
      "they're great for an office\n",
      "but this one guy next to me, who's not here just so I could talk about him,  he uses his speaker phone all the time,\n",
      "and it carries over\n",
      "and so not only would you hear,\n",
      "it seems to me that you talk longer from you kind of yell into it.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh, and so he yells into it,\n",
      "and you hear the other person too,\n",
      "so it's kind of a double annoyance.\n",
      "He actually, uh, ruins my privacy you might say because the, the T I offices are so open anyway. Uh, that I'm amazed that, the fact that I'm about ready to say something, uh, if he's even thought of that that's a real uncourteous thing, an, an invasion of everyone else's time and, and concentration to just be loud.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "I don't know whether that's an invasion of privacy just being loud and, and annoying, you know.\n",
      "Uh, that's,  perhaps not quite an invasion of privacy\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but I think it is,\n",
      "and\n",
      "we both picked phone items there.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Let's see, I'm trying to think.\n",
      "Oh, have you heard that, that, I'm trying to think of what company it was, there was a company that was going to, uh, be giving out information about your financial status.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "I heard something about, not that exactly,\n",
      "but go ahead.\n",
      "Well, um, I work in the computer science center\n",
      "and so we hear a lot about things that are, that computers are capable of doing.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, uh, this was a software program that a company was developing that was going to have X amount of million peoples financial history and information on it.\n",
      "And they were going to sell it to companies who would up in turn solicit you for business et cetera, et cetera.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, they finally, uh, stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused,  because it was such a big deal.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either.\n",
      "I mean, there was a lot of stuff going on about it.\n",
      "Well, I, uh, heard something similar to that.\n",
      "I listen to,\n",
      "I'm a, uh, uh, talk show person.\n",
      "And there was,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "when I, when I do my chores up at the\n",
      "I'm a radio person I guess is what I mean.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And so I listened to, was it five seventy, which has continuous talk on the weekends,  and Neil Sperry and everybody, I mean, the lawyers and veterinarians and all that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, I don't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a a financial application, all that information on there is really not necessarily,\n",
      "even a, your Social Security number, you know, they,  you should just put down the basics and put N A, where you don't want to answer.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Whether it's your personal salary or whatever.\n",
      "Uh, if your just making out a credit card application you don't need to put down\n",
      "and I was curious as to you know, what specific things you, you did have to put down.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "But he says Social Security, you don't need to put that down there. Which I thought was surprising.\n",
      "So maybe there's something along that same line where, you know, in all these financial, uh, applications that you make out, you don't have to put all that stuff down there.\n",
      "It would be nice to know what's, what was,\n",
      "of course, of course, they could say, well, I can't give you a card,\n",
      "and you could say, fine,\n",
      "but, you know, some things will be private, you know,\n",
      "but he said just put N A\n",
      "and he said usually you'll get approved anyway because they just want your money they want your card.\n",
      "But if you don't feel like putting it down, just put N A, you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, that's real interesting.\n",
      "I know that a lot of times they ask for information that they don't really need,  on several things and, you know, your credit ap and all, all they ever need you to do is give them permission to, to pull a credit thing on, on yourself\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "and there it is.\n",
      "That's all they really care about.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "They just want that credit history to see if you're a person.\n",
      "If you're going to go ahead and pay your bills on time and things like that.\n",
      "I haven't,\n",
      "I don't have any friends down at the, the Austin plant,\n",
      "but I heard that they were really upset about the drug thing,\n",
      "and we seem to up here have just breezed through that\n",
      "and apparently some other companies are having trouble\n",
      "that, I don't have any trouble with it.\n",
      "Uh, it's kind of unusual here we are in Dallas, you know, the biggest location and, and it just breezed through\n",
      "and wasn't really, no one was, I guess, was really too concerned about it, uh, yet in Austin, there, there were, whether it was a class action or how far it got, I don't really know because T I only had a few things on T I NEWS I think about it,  that they were objecting to\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good news.\n",
      "Right\n",
      "And, uh.\n",
      "and I, I think there's an attempt to do that.\n",
      "You know, I think people,\n",
      "there's a mild attempt for that,\n",
      "but I think basically, we basically associate news with bad news or, or catastrophes or problems or crises, or, uh, you know.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "we do.\n",
      "I think our concept of news isn't necessarily events that happen.\n",
      "It's more negative, like you said.\n",
      "True,\n",
      "true.\n",
      "But, I think people try to, on, on T V I think, they try to throw in good stuff,\n",
      "but it doesn't, uh, it doesn't sway the vote.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I've heard an interesting comment also that, uh, with budget cuts and, uh, expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media, whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or, uh, investigative reporting, on certain topics and issues,\n",
      "but that takes time,\n",
      "that takes an awful lot of money and commitment,\n",
      "and, and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and go after, you know, it's lot easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer, and, uh, find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things,\n",
      "so. I don't know,\n",
      "I guess the economy is, is effecting also the news media\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and we have to pay that price,\n",
      "but, uh, I don't know,\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "It's interesting,\n",
      "and I think that nowadays with communications the way they are also, that we can see global events happening as, as they occur all over the world, like the,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "You know, the war last winter was certainly a good example of that  because we saw every single thing, practically.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "We saw,\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "you know, twenty years ago, thirty years ago, we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or, or luxury to, to view that.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "I mean, you know, I remember, well, just the things that are covered.\n",
      "I remember watching the World Series during the earthquake, and just seeing that happen\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "I mean, you know, that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake and the, and the announcers, you know grabbing,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I mean, it's like, that was just something because that was like live and real like you said,\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and then, of course, one thing I think, too, is with\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "Mike, I guess we'll be talking about painting recently.\n",
      "Any kind of recent painting you've done, uh, yourself?\n",
      "Have you done any recently?\n",
      "Well, we, uh, remodeled a bathroom. And, which required, uh, completely repainting the bathroom,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and the other project we've done around here is, uh, we've remodeled all our, all our closets which required quite a bit of painting.\n",
      "Wow,\n",
      "wow,\n",
      "that's, that's quite a chore.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I imagine it did.\n",
      "Did you have that done professionally\n",
      "or did you do that yourself?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "we did it ourselves,\n",
      "did it myself.\n",
      "Did you enjoy that?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh, that's, that's fun.\n",
      "We just recently, uh, had our boys' room,\n",
      "our two oldest boys share a room,\n",
      "and they're, uh, the paint has, uh, kind of faded and deteriorated,\n",
      "and so we decided to paint their room and put up wallpaper and border and so forth,\n",
      "and, uh, looks quite good.\n",
      "We were quite pleased with the result.\n",
      "Is this a project you did yourself?\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "it's a project, uh, that I did,\n",
      "yes,\n",
      "and, and, uh.\n",
      "What, what brought about the fading of the paint?\n",
      "Well\n",
      "Just sun exposure?\n",
      "I don't think it's sun exposure,\n",
      "but, uh, boys will be boys,\n",
      "and there, there were crayon marks on there\n",
      "and we had to, to scrub the crayon marks off, of course, try and get it clean.\n",
      "Oh, okay,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Latex paint?\n",
      "Pardon me?\n",
      "Latex?\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "it was.\n",
      "It was latex paint,\n",
      "and that's, uh, what we put back on there, was a latex paint.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Plus, uh, they had bunk beds,\n",
      "and the boy, one of the younger boys, when he was younger, about three years old, got a, uh, got a nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures\n",
      "On the ceiling?\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "on the ceiling.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, uh, you scrub and you scrub,\n",
      "but you can't it all off.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "that's true.\n",
      "And so, that's one of the reasons why we painted,\n",
      "and, uh.\n",
      "Did you go, what kind of paint did you use on the ceiling?\n",
      "We used a flat, latex paint\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "and in the bedroom, as I understand, that's, uh, one of the better type of paints to have because it's not so reflective and, and glassy colored,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it, uh, turned out real, real well.\n",
      "Seems like, uh, I've, we've done some remodeling of some, uh, rental houses that we have\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it appears as though that, uh, oh, in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses were built, uh, they used a lot of, uh, semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and that was a little difficult to cover with today's paints, it seemed like.\n",
      "We had an occasion, uh, where we had to do some sealing of, uh, the of the, this type of paint before we could paint it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, you had to prime it and and cover over it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "You had pretty good luck with one coat type paint?\n",
      "You use a particular brand or anything?\n",
      "Well, I like to use this, this Sears, uh, the ten year guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee.\n",
      "Weather beater type stuff?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And the reason being is once I painted, I don't want to have to go and do it another five or seven years later\n",
      "Understand.\n",
      "but, uh,\n",
      "and, uh, we're quite satisfied with that\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, and occasionally you can watch for it and get it on sale,\n",
      "and we do, do that.\n",
      "In fact, I was just reading an article,\n",
      "you mentioned painting your bathroom.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I read an article recently that, uh, you have to be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does tend to, to peel or come off because of the moisture, high moisture content in your bath, bathroom.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's a lot like, uh, wall paper.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "And, uh, did you have any problems with that\n",
      "or,\n",
      "Well, the particular bathroom that we did is a half bath,\n",
      "so we didn't have a problem with that.\n",
      "Oh, good.\n",
      "Uh, I have had, I've, uh, have never experienced that type of a problem uh, with a latex paint.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, good.\n",
      "neither have I\n",
      "So, you shouldn't have a, you shouldn't have a problem with it.\n",
      "Oh, good.\n",
      "They're, they're pretty well refined today a lot of the paints,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and Sears is one of the better ones.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I've used, uh, many a gallon of them, myself.\n",
      "Do you, uh, have you ever used an oil base paint?\n",
      "Uh, used oil base paints for trim you know, like around doors and, and on doors, things like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "why do you use that?\n",
      "I'm, I'm kind of learning at this, new at this,\n",
      "but. It adheres better, or lasts longer?\n",
      "Uh, primarily because it, it seems to be a little more, uh, well, let's say\n",
      "well, not so much that.\n",
      "It seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings as opposed to, uh, a latex type paint.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, it just, you know, it, it gives you a, a variance even though it's the same color.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Well, that's good,\n",
      "that's good.\n",
      "So it's worked out pretty well for us.\n",
      "Uh, have you ever done any painting outside?\n",
      "Uh, quite a bit,\n",
      "painted a couple of houses.\n",
      "Uh, recently this summer we painted a, uh, out building, which is a shed that we have on the,\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "where does she live?\n",
      "Uh, on Rutherford.\n",
      "Rutherford.\n",
      "I don't know that.\n",
      "It's, uh, corner of New York uh, just west of Mayfield.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's, oh, oh, south and, okay,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I know where you, I know the area.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "that's kind of on the other side of town,\n",
      "so our kids probably never went to school together or anything\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Oh, they're, they're little ones\n",
      "Oh, well, I've got one in college\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "By now.\n",
      "Let's see, we're on government,  whether we think it's honest or can be.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Whether it is possible to have an honest government. I'm beginning to think it's not.\n",
      "What about you?\n",
      "I, I don't think under the way the system is right now, it is.\n",
      "I don't either.\n",
      "I, I think,\n",
      "uh, even if people have good intentions, I think uh, power corrupts or something to a certain extent, you know.\n",
      "The ultimate power, ultimately corrupts.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it seems like, uh, maybe more of them come in with good intentions,\n",
      "but it's just so enticing,\n",
      "and a lot of corners being cut and the special deals available, because they're in on the know , you know\n",
      "I don't know if,  there is enough money that you could pay them just,  you know X amount of money to keep them honest.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "I just, I just don't, uh,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I mean, you even see people on a small scale cheating when they have certain positions,\n",
      "you know what I mean?\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Little bitty, little bitty positions in your own home town, and they'll cheat somehow or, you know, bend the rules, use their power.\n",
      "So maybe it's just man's nature\n",
      "We had, uh, here in Oklahoma we had a few years ago a major, uh, corruption on, on our county commissioners\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and there were several counties, uh, including the one I was in, that lost every one of their county commissioners\n",
      "and, I mean, it was to the point of not just losing their job, but going to jail.\n",
      "Oh, my word.\n",
      "Oh, wow.\n",
      "What were they doing taking some,\n",
      "Oh, they were taking kickbacks.\n",
      "Oh, no\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Oh, gosh.\n",
      "Just a little here, a little there.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "right\n",
      "Major amount here, a major amount there.\n",
      "Right\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "But I think there was something like, you know, thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail.\n",
      "Um. We haven't had that big a scandal in Arlington,\n",
      "but we do have the people that work for the convention center were falsifying records.\n",
      "In other words, they'd go out and have a big, lavish dinner and then put somebody's name down that they supposedly had entertained,\n",
      "but that person wasn't even anywhere near there, you know.\n",
      "Some of them weren't even in the same city.\n",
      "One of them had, had cancer and died\n",
      "and I mean, that was our biggest scandal for the last few years, I think.\n",
      "Uh, that's, that's small scale.\n",
      "I don't know, you know,\n",
      "I really don't know what could be done. Uh,\n",
      "I don't, I don't either. Uh, to make it totally honest.\n",
      "Uh, I think there's, there's always going to be some way somebody can cut a corner, uh.\n",
      "However, the things that have gone, gone on in the last couple of years, we can't afford too many of those, you know, the  the HUD mess or the S and L.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "We could almost not afford such terrible corruption.\n",
      "The cover-ups and,\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "I think that, uh, Reagan and Bush were up to their necks in that Iran Contra thing,\n",
      "and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that,\n",
      "but, uh,\n",
      "I, uh, I don't know.\n",
      "I just, uh, I'd like to believe that there is some way that our political people would really go there and look out for our interests.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I think that's what upsets me worse than, that they're getting a little, you know, uh, on the side that, that,  it seems that when they get up there it's, it's what, if I vote your way, what it'll do for me rather,  than this is the way my constituents want it.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "That's right,\n",
      "but they stay there,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "and this would be for the best for the nation overall.\n",
      "You're right,\n",
      "it's just a,\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I guess that's where they stay in, uh, in,\n",
      "they try to stay in office.\n",
      "But they always please the money people too.\n",
      "They need money so much, because they're constantly having to run,  for office again.\n",
      "run,\n",
      "And,\n",
      "Maybe\n",
      "and then you think, well, if it was longer terms then they would never have to try to please the people at home\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "Boy, it is a big problem,\n",
      "but I think most people are kind of depressed and cynical about government now,\n",
      "don't you?\n",
      "I don't think that they, anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "It's really terrible.\n",
      "I mean, there was a time, I mean where, I remember when I was real young, I just loved Harry Truman.\n",
      "I thought he was great\n",
      "Oh, you know, I had,\n",
      "some of them seemed like kind of, uh, heroic people.\n",
      "Well I wonder if they really were,  or if we just really didn't,\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "Jerry, the topic was favorite T V shows, and what kind are you interested in, and how they, and do they differ from like mine.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, okay, uh,\n",
      "most of, most of the, uh, commercial television these days, I'm just a little bit sick of.\n",
      "Uh, in fact, I don't watch hardly any, uh, television at all with, uh, my other activities.\n",
      "Uh, between my family and my church et cetera, et cetera, well I don't have time, I hardly any time to sit down and watch the news.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Now I do watch the Discover channel and some on channel thirteen\n",
      "but, uh, aside from aside from that, I pretty well, uh, turn it off.\n",
      "Oh, do you,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Oh, I'm sort of a, well,\n",
      "I'm different from that.\n",
      "I'm sort of a, a movie buff.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I go to a couple of movies a week, sometimes,\n",
      "but honestly I'm, I'm self-employed,\n",
      "and a lot of times I will, uh, go out and take a lunch hour, go to lunch from like twelve to two, go to a movie and just come back to my office.\n",
      "I don't blame you.\n",
      "But, uh, I do it,\n",
      "it's like entertainment,\n",
      "and I'm pretty much of a, a junk movie watcher by myself.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "If I take my wife, then we see something a little nicer, you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "But, uh,\n",
      "and my kids are all sort of movie watchers.\n",
      "You know, we, we've always been to a lot of, we've always gone to a lot of movies in our life.\n",
      "So, but I would just as soon, uh, be doing something else,\n",
      "it's just that my kids are gone now,\n",
      "and, and my wife's a school teacher\n",
      "and sometimes, and she doesn't get home until about seven o'clock.\n",
      "So, you know, I'll come in like five thirty or six,\n",
      "and I'll turn on the tube set there and have my coffee or Coke or whatever and a little T V\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and sometimes I set there all evening.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "I, well, it,\n",
      "sometimes if, if it's real good,\n",
      "like there's more, there's been more than one evening that I've, uh, caught, uh, every animal show that evening on, uh, on the Discover channel.\n",
      "You bet,\n",
      "you bet.\n",
      "And, uh, because they're, uh, they're, they're, you know, they're documentaries and they're.\n",
      "Well, that's an interesting channel.\n",
      "Oh, you bet,\n",
      "in fact I'm glad that it's part of our, uh, basic cable package.\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "But, uh,\n",
      "You know, I've, I've just never spent any time watching it\n",
      "and, you know I like my sports and everything\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but I,\n",
      "Oh, oh, me too.\n",
      "Hello\n",
      "Watch my Dallas Cowboys.\n",
      "I watched them to halftime before I left\n",
      "and I left at halftime\n",
      "Well, they, they, they whooped up on them.\n",
      "and started driving.\n",
      "They sure did.\n",
      "They just did an excellent job.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "and they're in the playoffs,\n",
      "and I'm not sure that the Eagles are not.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "the Eagles\n",
      "I did.\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "luck into it now, I think.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's true.\n",
      "Cowboys, they earned it on their own merit.\n",
      "Well.\n",
      "Did you know, everybody, or not everybody but quite a few of the folks were kind of down on Mister Johnson,\n",
      "but, uh, he's, uh, he's brought the pokes, uh, from a, a one and something team to, uh, playoffs, in what, three years now.\n",
      "You bet,\n",
      "as much as everyone, you know, used the word, love Tom Landry, I'm glad that Jimmy Johnson's there.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "well, it's, uh, you know, it was the time for the passing of the guard, I mean.\n",
      "It was.\n",
      "And I think Tom knew it.\n",
      "I think so too.\n",
      "So, uh,\n",
      "He wanted to go out a winner though.\n",
      "I think he would have stayed there four or five more years until he could have gone out\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's true,\n",
      "and I wouldn't, I wouldn't have blamed him one bit because\n",
      "Oh, no,\n",
      "it's, you know he earned his stripes.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "but, see, nobody remembers him as a loser because he's too, he's too far, he's far too much of a gentleman and a, and a practicing Christian to, uh to ever be thought of as anything but a you know, but a winner.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "he's a, he's a winner in anyone's book\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and I hope he's a winner in his own book, you know because that's the key there.\n",
      "Oh, he is,\n",
      "he is\n",
      "because he has to like himself before he can like other people. Uh,\n",
      "You bet.\n",
      "Little things that disturb me,\n",
      "and I know he's being a little hardnosed about it\n",
      "but, uh, you know, this ring of honor thing, you know, he needs to be there because he's earned it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "He deserves it,\n",
      "and he was the Dallas Cowboys,\n",
      "and he won't do that yet.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So. I hope he makes up his mind to do it, because he needs to be remembered.\n",
      "Oh, he will.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Well, nobody's going to forget Tom Landry.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "no,\n",
      "no.\n",
      "Shoot, come now\n",
      "Absolutely not\n",
      "That's true,\n",
      "but he needs to be honored,\n",
      "I mean, I'd not a\n",
      "let's put it that way.\n",
      "you betcha.\n",
      "I'm not a native Texan by birth\n",
      "but, uh, I guess if I, uh, length of, length of time I'm in the state now, is what, after you're here twenty years you're considered native.\n",
      "You bet.\n",
      "I've been here since seventy-four,\n",
      "and I feel like a native.\n",
      "Well, let's see,\n",
      "I came down March of sixty-nine, went to work for T and I.\n",
      "Oh, did you.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, uh, I haven't looked back yet either,\n",
      "so\n",
      "We came, we came down from New York state in seventy-four, and uh, never had any regrets at all.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Especially looking at some of the weather New York state has had\n",
      "You bet.\n",
      "It's been.\n",
      "and then look at the weather we have down here.\n",
      "Huh\n",
      "It's a great place to raise our kids,\n",
      "and I've got my last kid graduating from college this next December\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "she's getting married the month before in November,\n",
      "so\n",
      "Oh, goodness.\n",
      "I will have finished, be finished with that.\n",
      "Well, we're well, we're finished with all but the last one, and trying to get him through his technical school\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and, uh, we're, uh, he's over halfway,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Well, good.\n",
      "You know, we're not staying on the topic of television shows,\n",
      "but I'm really not too concerned,\n",
      "are you?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "not at all.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "me neither.\n",
      "I'm enjoying the chat. Uh.\n",
      "Well, I enjoy my T V programs.\n",
      "I like those,\n",
      "I like those detective programs.\n",
      "I like everything.\n",
      "I can watch Bill Cosby because I think he has a great show.\n",
      "Well.\n",
      "Do you have, uh, some strong feelings one way or the other about, about the care of the elderly?\n",
      "Well, yes,\n",
      "I do.\n",
      "Uh, this is a, a question that hit pretty close to home.\n",
      "I had to go through this with my dad about four years ago.\n",
      "He was, his health was failing\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, he was adamant about two things.\n",
      "One was that I take care of my mother,\n",
      "and two, that he not be put into a home.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And we talked, uh, about some length,\n",
      "and I respected his wishes.\n",
      "He, uh, stayed at home as long as he could,\n",
      "and then, uh, he died in a hospital.\n",
      "But, um, I think that, my position is that, uh, you need to find one that you can really have confidence that they are taking care of the, of the, uh, of their clients\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "and, um, because I've heard about the many abuses, and because he had heard of so many abuses, he just didn't want that.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "How about you?\n",
      "Well, my graduate work is in speech pathology,\n",
      "and, uh, so, so, uh, I've thought about this more than once, uh, you know, dealing with\n",
      "uh, you know, I'm concerned, we're going to have a geriatric, uh, population, in in twenty years it's going to be, you know, phenomenal.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "almost thirty, all over thirty percent, isn't it.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Uh, and, um, but I have been amazed\n",
      "and, and in talking with, uh, some of my fellow students, it looks as though, um, nursing homes are not going to be the only option any more\n",
      "and, uh, in twenty years. Uh, where a lot of students are hoping, uh, to work as an in the home type, uh, uh, approach, where, where the, uh, where there's, you know, the speech therapist, or whether it's a nursing specialist or someone plans to, uh, work out of a family's home and take the responsibility away from the family but yet allow the, the loved one to stay, you know, at home with the family members.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, it's, it's difficult for many families, especially in the case of, uh, of Alzheimer's and, and, uh, some of the more degenerative diseases to, uh, say, uh, uh, leave them, to have them at home, because then the family becomes completely, uh\n",
      "They're captive.\n",
      "exactly.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and, and did, did you experience that with your, with your father or not?\n",
      "Uh, we had a, at one stage we had care somewhat like, like what you're talking about.\n",
      "We had the Visiting Nurses program\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they sent somebody in,\n",
      "and it, it was a, a nominal charge that this, uh, it started out that the lady would come in I think three times a week and eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "They would try to get him to exercise.\n",
      "They would try to, uh, you know,\n",
      "they would check him over to, to, you know, the basic checks.\n",
      "Try to get him to talk and be motivated\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, that's what we went through.\n",
      "Uh, up to a point things seemed to be working,\n",
      "and then, uh, I think, he, he became discouraged\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and they did not know how to take care of that,\n",
      "and then, um, at that point I think it's mostly a psychological problem.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And, uh, but, yes,\n",
      "I agree there's a lot of options.\n",
      "There could be a lot of options.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I think it's time that, uh, we decide to do something about it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "You know, one of the other subjects on the switchboard, and this is one that I've been thinking applies here, uh, where, where, uh, young, young kids, uh, graduating from high school, whether they should do a community service type work.\n",
      "This would be an excellent example of some where, uh, some place where, um, the community could be more involved, you know, more than just leaving it only to professionals.\n",
      "There is a lot the community, the community can do to, uh, enhance the, or, or assist the lives of those who are keeping a loved one at home.\n",
      "I suppose at one time the church would fulfill this need.\n",
      "Possibly before.\n",
      "I don't know now.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "the church or synagogue, whatever because typically these were close knit groups at one time,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but in today's large metropolitan areas, or even in most, even, even the rural areas now, people are not quite as close as they once were.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Uh, the mobility factor, the factor that, uh, oh, we're living longer and people are less trusting, all these things tend to destroy this type of system.\n",
      "But I agree with you,\n",
      "there might be some possibilities there.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Although dealing with geriatrics is something a lot of young people just aren't emotionally prepared to do.\n",
      "I agree.\n",
      "That's a, that's a good point.\n",
      "I think they would have to have some training.\n",
      "Uh, let's see.\n",
      "Personal computers.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So, do you use them?\n",
      "Uh, yes,\n",
      "um, we own one.\n",
      "Terrific.\n",
      "What kind?\n",
      "Uh, its an Emerson eighty eighty-six, um, two low density floppy drives, and no hard drive yet.\n",
      "But, uh, you know, it's, it comes in mighty handy.\n",
      "Mostly for word processing type things?\n",
      "Uh, yeah,\n",
      "a big chunk of it's word processing.\n",
      "We're also taking programming classes,\n",
      "and, uh, so there's a fair amount of programming getting done on it.\n",
      "But, uh, uh, the, uh,\n",
      "right now we got a project going where we're trying to put, uh, all my wife's stray recipes on the disk.\n",
      "Nice.\n",
      "Did you buy a program to handle menus?\n",
      "Uh, it came with a menus program,\n",
      "but, uh, that doesn't,\n",
      "it, it\n",
      "both, excuse me,\n",
      "mostly kind of a pain in the neck without a hard drive\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "and hopefully sometime this spring we'll be able to get one and get it configured.\n",
      "Eighty eighty-eight is what you said?\n",
      "Eighty eighty-six.\n",
      "Eighty,\n",
      "oh gosh, it's worth your time to just upgrade,\n",
      "they're so darned cheap now.\n",
      "Which,\n",
      "Computers.\n",
      "Uh, impoverished college student.\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "This one went on a credit card,\n",
      "and we got a way out, while to pay it off yet.\n",
      "Uh, I've, I've got one at home too.\n",
      "It's a three eighty-six, thirty-three megahertz, forty, four meg ram and hundred and thirty meg drive\n",
      "and super V G A\n",
      "and, yeah, it's fun.\n",
      "I do programming, too.\n",
      "My job is, uh, E D P auditor,\n",
      "and so I'm into computers all the time.\n",
      "E D P.\n",
      "Electronic Data Processing.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "that sounds like fun job.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I really enjoy it,\n",
      "and it treats me well.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Uh, what are you studying in college  computers?\n",
      "Uh.  Computer engineering.\n",
      "How nice.\n",
      "Well, computer engineering technology, uh, which, uh, all I can understand is it's a slightly more hands on version of computer engineering.\n",
      "But, I've got a ways to go yet.\n",
      "So far most of what I've done is getting, gotten core classes out of the way,\n",
      "taken some electronics classes, and one class in, um, with computer logic.\n",
      "How they work is fascinating to me.\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "I enjoy it myself\n",
      "The, uh, lab for that, uh, computer logic class was a lot of fun.\n",
      "Was it.\n",
      "Did,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we got to hook up a few, uh, counters and, uh, encoders.\n",
      "Hardware stuff, huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "What do you think of that fuzzy logic?\n",
      "I've not had a chance to work with it, although, um, my, uh, data structures teacher was telling us something about how fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Now how you'd implement that software wise or mechanically I don't know,\n",
      "but, uh, it sounds like a very impressive piece of, piece of work.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they're pretty amazing.\n",
      "Uh, I've written a couple of programs for, commercially, uh\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "and it's a fun field.\n",
      "In the fuzzy logic direction?\n",
      "What,\n",
      "no,\n",
      "in, uh,\n",
      "no,\n",
      "just regular, uh,\n",
      "but you have to take into account, you know, with any computer program all the type of things people can do to you to make your program crash or things you normally don't consider.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Entering bad information of one sort or another\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "pushing keys certain times and, Uh, messing up your files and things like that.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And you're going to be an engineer, computer engineer type.\n",
      "Uh, yeah,\n",
      "well, what the computer, what the C E T program seems to be so far is just a broad based specialized from,\n",
      "you get programming, a fair amount of programming,\n",
      "you get hardware,\n",
      "you get, uh, more or less, uh, you get basic electronics courses that, uh, deal with, you know, not only the digital circuitry but, uh, you know, power supplies and, and, uh, just the whole gambit, but mostly towards, uh, computer electronics.\n",
      "So, the idea is that, um, you can go in a variety of direction from C E T major,\n",
      "but I I have more with the hardware than I do with the software,\n",
      "so, yeah\n",
      "I pretty much plan on, I mean, so far I'm planning to go in the engineering direction.\n",
      "I don't,\n",
      "That's good, uh,\n",
      "Set.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You, you got the topic, right?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Uh, well, where in Dallas are you?\n",
      "I'm in Richardson.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "So you do do recycling there?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "Richardson has, uh, well, they have a newspaper pick up once a week supposedly, if it's not raining.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And they also have a couple of areas where you can take, uh, cans, plastic and paper, to, uh, you know, dump them off there if you don't, uh, want to wait and have a pick up, least of paper,\n",
      "but they don't pick up the other items.\n",
      "They don't pick up cans or the plastic.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Are they going to later,\n",
      "do you know?\n",
      "I'm not sure.\n",
      "They only started to do the newspaper uh, late last year.\n",
      "Just kind of like a trial basis. And see how it goes, so I don't know if they're going to pick up the other things.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "What about you?\n",
      "Well, I'm, I'm in Dallas proper in the city of Dallas\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I know they do have, you know, a pilot program going on\n",
      "but it's not here.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "So they're not picking up anything\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "So, I mean, we, we collect everything\n",
      "We've got all these boxes in our garage for, you know, green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything.\n",
      "Where do you take them?\n",
      "Well, there's, there's a couple places.\n",
      "Unfortunately, we can't find a place that will take everything.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Uh, there's a lot of places to take, like the plastic, uh, shopping bags like most of the grocery stores.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And there's a Wal-Mart nearby that takes almost everything.\n",
      "I can't remember what it is they don't take.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "And the library will take glass.\n",
      "So we end up, you know,\n",
      "on the weekend we pack it all in the car\n",
      "and, and as we go places we, oh, wait, we can drop the glass off you know.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Drop things off one at a time,\n",
      "but, uh, and it's kind of disappointing, I mean,\n",
      "I would even be happy if they just had one, you know, one place where you could do everything.\n",
      "You know, it would still be more convenient than what we have now.\n",
      "One of the people from my department, I think used to take a lot of the stuff to a recycling center that was for the benefit of the Dallas Shelter.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "I think it was closer to downtown.\n",
      "Where is that?\n",
      "Uh, she's not here anymore\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "but, uh, yeah,\n",
      "I'm pretty far north.\n",
      "I'm not, I'm, I'm, I'm just, I'm north of Addison actually.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "So I'm, I'm really\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm, I'm in Dallas, but only technically\n",
      "Well, sometimes we take our, uh, we always keep our aluminum cans.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I've seen those.\n",
      "You don't get too much money back.\n",
      "I figure it pays for the gas to take my cans over there.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But normally I collect, oh, like three trash bags full\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and I take them over to that can bank\n",
      "and it's more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans in the can bank.\n",
      "Don't get too much money for them\n",
      "but,\n",
      "Well, you get something\n",
      "Uh,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We used to do that,\n",
      "but, again, that's another stop\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it doesn't take plastic bags and, and all that sort of thing,\n",
      "but, uh, I think that, you know, I heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is\n",
      "and so hopefully they'll do it soon.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, where I grew up we only had one a week\n",
      "and that was certainly sufficient.\n",
      "So if they just do,\n",
      "one of them will be trash\n",
      "and the alternate time would be recyclables,\n",
      "that would be great.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, I'm disappointed sometimes they're not always consistent in picking up those papers, you know.\n",
      "I seem to put them out there on Wednesday\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and like sometimes they come by,\n",
      "sometimes they don't.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "I'm not really sure why they're not always consistent in that.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "But I could certainly have, uh, three bins out there for, you know, plastic and and tin and paper, whatever they were going to, uh, separate into and, and have them pick it up on, on one of the two days per week.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "That would be easy.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Do you have to, uh, sort the paper and take out the glossy pages and that, that sort of thing\n",
      "or do they take the whole thing?\n",
      "You're not supposed to have, like the coupons in there.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Uh, or you're not supposed to put magazines in there\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and you can't take newspapers.\n",
      "Now at work, uh, you know, we have changed our recycling.\n",
      "At first they were kind of finicky about what kind of paper you could recycle.\n",
      "And not too long ago they finally decided if it's anything that's paper and tears, you can throw it in there because at first they said,\n",
      "Let me guess\n",
      "you work at T I,\n",
      "right?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "at first they said, They said, no telephone books.\n",
      "So do I.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You know, well, that's stupid\n",
      "and then they said no newspapers.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Well, in the, my department everybody gets the WALL STREET JOURNAL.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "There was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasn't recyclable.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So I thought that was pretty good to expand upon it,\n",
      "say,\n",
      "Well, and they take cans, now, too. Which is great.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I still put my cans in with the cans.\n",
      "I mean, I don't want it with paper.\n",
      "Somehow that just seems weird to me\n",
      "Well, our department used to collect the cans anyway for the Christmas tree project.\n",
      "And, In fact we got, this past year, we got all of our money for the Christmas tree because we saved cans for the entire year.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Ooh.\n",
      "And it worked out really well.\n",
      "Well, we had the one person who used to take things to the Dallas Shelter.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I think that's what that was called.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "She collected, she used to collect from the whole department,\n",
      "but she took them all down to that Dallas Shelter place.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I wish I could remember the whole name of that place,\n",
      "but it's a charity for the benefit of this shelter.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, yeah,\n",
      "she, she used to collect them from everybody in the department.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "She'd go up and down with her little bag collecting from everybody.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Because we would get it,\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "you got any hobbies that you want to talk about?\n",
      "Well, I, uh, don't seem to have as much spare time as I used to,\n",
      "but, I guess I'll have to say my computer has probably taken the place of most of my hobbies.\n",
      "What in the world do you do with your computer that takes so much time?\n",
      "Well, I sit and design cards\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "and, uh, oh, I, I'm really into graphics,\n",
      "so, it, it just, I sit and learn new programs\n",
      "and I play\n",
      "and I do this,\n",
      "and I do that\n",
      "and, I'm, I'm starting a side business in desk top publishing\n",
      "Did you have, uh, your own business\n",
      "or you do that as, just on the side, or what?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, it's just getting going.\n",
      "I, I'm teaching in the daytime\n",
      "Well.\n",
      "and, uh, I teach business and computer technology.\n",
      "What do you teach?\n",
      "Oh, that's good.\n",
      "Well, I guess\n",
      "It's, uh, to high school kids, it's, uh, alternative learning\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, it's, it's really a challenge,\n",
      "but. What hobbies do you have?\n",
      "Well, I, uh, play trombone in the Plano Community Band.\n",
      "Ooh, neat.\n",
      "And I, uh, like to do a lot of bicycling when the weather allows, and during summer when there's daylight savings time's when I get out and bike.\n",
      "Well, I hope you all had as pretty a day today as we did.\n",
      "Well, it wasn't too bad, other than the Cowboys didn't do so hot.\n",
      "Oh, well now, yes\n",
      "I don't think you can blame the weather on that.\n",
      "We had.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "just a crummy, well, actually\n",
      "the Lions are pretty good, I'm afraid, they a lot better team than the Cowboys were today.\n",
      "And, uh, .\n",
      "On any given day, they say.\n",
      "Uh, I haven't, I haven't played in a while, but I do, when I get time and it's pretty weather and it's summer I like to play golf.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "I, I play that about six times a year\n",
      "and every year I hang my bag up if I get that five or six\n",
      "and I swear, swear that game off for another year,\n",
      "but I always go back to it\n",
      "Oh, I, uh, oh, I take spells,\n",
      "I'm, I'm kind of a compulsive obsessive person\n",
      "and when I start something, I, I go into it a thousand percent\n",
      "I understand that.\n",
      "and then I get, I get burned out on it.\n",
      "But, uh, I do some counted cross-stitch and some painting on shirts.\n",
      "Well, you do lots of stuff.\n",
      "Well, it doesn't seem like I get anything done,\n",
      "but I guess I do\n",
      "and, I, I like to bake.\n",
      "It's just me in the house,\n",
      "so, when I bake it's usually to take out for something.\n",
      "Gosh,\n",
      "I come up there I'll have to stop by and have, try some of your baking.\n",
      "Well.\n",
      "I call on people in .\n",
      "My business is, uh, machine tool sales,\n",
      "and I have some,\n",
      "I, I cover Texas and Oklahoma.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "So, I, what I said that I wasn't being real facetious about that.\n",
      "I got customers in Oklahoma City and Tulsa and Perry, Oklahoma  and Eda and all that, all that way.\n",
      "Oh, how neat.\n",
      "So you do quite a bit of traveling then.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "I,\n",
      "about thirty-three thousand miles a year.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "Ooh, well that doesn't leave a lot of time for hobbies,\n",
      "does it?\n",
      "Well, I usually,\n",
      "see, we, we have our, our band practice is on Monday night,\n",
      "and during the summer we, uh, we have concerts every Monday night in the park,\n",
      "and, uh, we, we have, you know, some concerts during the year,\n",
      "and, you know, various people in the communities want us to play for things,\n",
      "but those are usually on the weekend,\n",
      "so that isn't too bad.\n",
      "How big is your band?\n",
      "Well, we got, uh, pretty good size band.\n",
      "Not everybody shows up,\n",
      "but if everyone did we'd probably have over a hundred\n",
      "but we only average about forty to fifty people a, you know, usually.\n",
      "Ooh.\n",
      "Well, that's still a pretty good size band.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's not like there are four or five of you there.\n",
      "Oh, no,\n",
      "no.\n",
      "This is a,\n",
      "it's a concert band,\n",
      "and, uh, we have a lot of,\n",
      "I, I don't pretend to be that good,\n",
      "but there's a lot of people that, uh, you know, are band directors at schools, or have been,\n",
      "or, uh, you know, there some people that are actually music majors.\n",
      "They don't necessarily follow that any more, you know,\n",
      "that isn't necessarily their career,\n",
      "but, uh, we have some extremely good talent in there,\n",
      "and, uh, as a rule, it sounds pretty decent,\n",
      "so\n",
      "It's fun.\n",
      "I, I have absolutely no musical ability whatsoever,\n",
      "and I'm always very envious of people who do.\n",
      "Well, I don't know if I have any or not.\n",
      "I, I've always enjoyed it.\n",
      "I sing in a church choir on Wednesday nights when I'm around, and play in the band on Monday nights, and keeps you out of trouble that way.\n",
      "Well, I'm probably one of the few people that the,\n",
      "Okay, Lee.\n",
      "Tell me about your ideas on this, uh, the U S government supporting health insurance and so forth.\n",
      "Well, I think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health care\n",
      "and the reason is because the market place doesn't seem to have performed adequately, uh, the invisible hand that which Adam Smith wrote has, uh, provided some very good health care and, uh, much, I think inadequate health care. Uh,\n",
      "and in some cases, the absence of health care has resulted from market place forces\n",
      "and I think, uh, it's inevitable.\n",
      "It is just a matter of, uh, time and mistakes\n",
      "and they're both inevitable.\n",
      "Well what is this going to do the insurance companies who are supporting this work now and hopefully are doing, uh, a good job?\n",
      "Well, it's going to make it tough for them\n",
      "and it's going to be a difficult transition.\n",
      "I don't know, uh, how it's going to, uh, play out in terms of the particulars,\n",
      "but I don't think that society will be willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long.\n",
      "Our, uh, physical and mental and spiritual health, uh, it's really, uh, very costly.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "And, uh, as a society we are paying a staggering price for this.\n",
      "Well  this is what's bothering me, Lee, another question,\n",
      "My,\n",
      "do you think that there should be some control, uh, innovated such that the doctors are not allowed to charge ridiculously over priced things.\n",
      "We realize that for the individual person, some things are very important.\n",
      "Uh, matter of fact, in some respects their life might depend on it.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "But, by the same token some of these charges they make for well, minor endeavors, shall we say on the parts the doctors are really out of line.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "there are  they're abusive of privileges\n",
      "There should be some control of that.\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "and that is what is giving the local, uh, insurance companies hard times.\n",
      "That is the one thing we have no control over are these charges that happen when you go to hospitals\n",
      "and you get something done\n",
      "and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Well, this I think is one of the things that national health care of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten, or twenty or thirty years will address.\n",
      "Because I know this is, addressed by, uh, in Canada.\n",
      "I, I have a good friend who is, uh, a physician practicing in Canada.\n",
      "And they made the transition, uh,\n",
      "and I think that the, uh,\n",
      "for example the duplication of magnetic resonance imageries uh,\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "We have had several of them.\n",
      "My wife and I both have had that recently.\n",
      "I've, I've had one myself\n",
      "and, uh, they're wonderful technology,\n",
      "but cities have three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they need.\n",
      "So, I think that what the market place doesn't do because of the way the system has worked\n",
      "and it doesn't allocate resources oftenly because there is a tendency, uh, at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills,\n",
      "but it's begun to change all of that.\n",
      "The people paying the bills, uh,\n",
      "employers ultimately, have begun to squawk because they have seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, I think the evolution will be interesting.\n",
      "Uh, Hawaii has a system that is apparently working\n",
      "and, uh, it will be interesting to see how, how, uh, much more attention we pay to that.\n",
      "I do think though that it is inevitable primarily because of the pain, uh, that people are feeling, uh, under the circumstances.\n",
      "Uh, I believe that it will contribute to something that we would at this point call national health care, whether it's subsidized by the government and and operated by private insurers, uh,\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I like that idea.\n",
      "I tend to be one of those people who believes the market place can under varied circumstances with the profit incentive work very very well.\n",
      "Uh, I, we would be a lot better off if we, if we, contracted our national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity because we would probably have much less waste.\n",
      "See, that, that bothers me about the government see,\n",
      "uh, my,\n",
      "Well that's, that's the problem with government, uh, administration of these programs\n",
      "and that is one of the things that we as society are going to have to deal with.\n",
      "Government is going to have to change in this regard.\n",
      "Do you think that that these insurance things should be covered on a State basis or U S government basis?\n",
      "You know, that is really a tough one for me to answer.\n",
      "I don't, uh, I would like to see the greatest improvement in management.\n",
      "My, my, my field is the cognitive sciences\n",
      "and I recognize that a lot of these things that are done, are done, uh, as a function of the operating systems in place.\n",
      "And those operating systems have to change\n",
      "and and as we become more efficient in developing machine operating systems we're going to develop more efficient human operating systems\n",
      "and so a State or federal application, uh, could work.\n",
      "Uh, it all depends upon the way you structure the environment.\n",
      "We may have to deal with,\n",
      "I'm ready.\n",
      "Well in Atlanta, Georgia you probably have a lot more crime than we have here in Patterson, California.\n",
      "Oh could, could be.\n",
      "Uh, this little city is only about eight thousand people.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we,\n",
      "is, is crime a problem there?\n",
      "like a major problem, minor problem or,\n",
      "Well in Patterson there's,\n",
      "it's not a problem here.\n",
      "But like, uh, I lived in Oakland, uh, until just recently\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, Oakland, California, God, they've had like, uh, sixty-seven murders so far this year compared to like, uh, forty at this time last year.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So it's really bad there.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, and it's all related to drugs it seems like.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Is that what it's there too?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I've only been here for like, uh,\n",
      "probably just over six months I start, I  started school here.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, I came from a smaller town in, in New York\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and the city was fairly big size or not real big\n",
      "but we had a problem there\n",
      "but here there's just no comparison that, much more crime.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, every night the news is very depressing because it just, they run down the list of how many people were shot, you know, drive by shootings or whatever\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and it's, it, it's pretty bad.\n",
      "They're, they're,\n",
      "it's,\n",
      "things have basically improved here over the last few years.\n",
      "They've, they've actually taken steps to try to make it better\n",
      "but it still, it still is a problem.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Like I don't know what they can do to make it better unless they just hire more policemen.\n",
      "Well that's, that seems to be what they were doing\n",
      "and it has, and they've started, stepped up more patrols in certain areas\n",
      "and it has has made some places safer\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, you know, it's very difficult.\n",
      "I mean if you don't have an infinite amount of money to, to try to stop the problem although most people wish you could as it is a, it's definitely a problem\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "and you know, the more, more, less that's done about it the more it seems it tends to spread into smaller areas unfortunately.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well I, I think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and, you know, then maybe those other people would be kind of scared\n",
      "and they would not do these bad things, you know.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I think, I think that, uh, it's, uh, seems to be that, I don't know, some people they they do something, you know,\n",
      "they shoot somebody or whatever,\n",
      "they go to jail,\n",
      "sentenced to jail for like thirty years they're out in five\n",
      "and they're back on the street\n",
      "and then they shoot someone else\n",
      "and just a, a cycle\n",
      "and it seems, seems as though the, the system doesn't tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I just don't understand our, our laws here.\n",
      "Because, you know, like in other countries, man, I mean, they're really a lot stricter than we are.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's, definitely true.\n",
      "It seems, seems as though we try to play humanitarian I think to, a little to much *typo too\n",
      "and maybe some of the people don't deserve the, the humanitarian treatment that they get.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "But I don't know.\n",
      "It's a difficult situation I think\n",
      "and some, something has to be done because I definitely think it's, it, it really plays, reeks havoc with your quality of life when, you know, you can see it's going on around you\n",
      "but then when, once it finally affects you then, then it really starts to bother you.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh. Uh,\n",
      "But it seems, I mean,\n",
      "people have moved like out of the city because they want to get away from the crime\n",
      "and so they tend to spread the cities farther and farther out\n",
      "but, you know, it's only a matter of time before, you know, it still catches up with them.\n",
      "You can't really run away from the problem\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and something, you know, something has to be done but just that too many people argue about how to fix it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I know when I lived in Oakland, it was just that, uh, like, I definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of, of the city by myself.\n",
      "Oh, sure.\n",
      "And, uh, and then, then again some areas I wouldn't go by myself after dark you know.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "But down here, in Patterson, well like I say, it's so small that you can go anywhere.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's good .\n",
      "But just, uh, like twenty miles away see in Modesto, they have, uh, those gangs and things over there.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And it, it's bad.\n",
      "In Sacramento also, they have, uh, drive by shootings it seems like all the time.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, I don't know.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I just, I just don't know what, what they can do you know.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's, it's to bad because it's, uh, I mean, just even the random occurrences where, you know, it's unsafe for a woman just to walk from the car to the, some, in certain areas like from the car, from their car to the mall or something\n",
      "and it's dangerous.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "And it's just, that's just ridiculous\n",
      "and you know, it's just, that's just not right.\n",
      "Something you know .\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I mean like even, even going to the grocery store.\n",
      "I know we've had this one lady that was attacked, you know.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "I mean, just, you just, you just don't know what to do anymore, you know.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And some of the times it's happening in the daytime too, you know,\n",
      "so it's not always happening at dark.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So I don't know.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's definitely unfortunate\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Uh, let me see\n",
      "I've been sitting here awhile.\n",
      "I almost forgot the topic.\n",
      "But, uh, it seems like I get most of my news from television.\n",
      "I'm, we only get the paper on the weekends\n",
      "and so I'm not much of a, of a paper reader\n",
      "or but I, I and I'm don't, rarely listen to the, uh, radio\n",
      "so I get most of my news like from documentaries like FORTY-EIGHT HOURS, TWENTY TWENTY, you know, the news at night. News in the afternoon, that kind of thing.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well I get a, weekend paper as well\n",
      "and, uh, in addition to that I get a local weekly.\n",
      "I, I live in suburb of Milwaukee\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they get, they have community newspapers around here so the local, their extremely local stuff uh, is in the local paper that comes out once a week\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and then I get the Sunday, uh, MILWAUKEE JOURNAL because I don't have time to read a paper.\n",
      "Uh, mostly  that's my difficulty.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I, uh, I get my news pretty much from the same sources as you do, although I do listen to N P R which has very good, and that's National Public Radio which  has very good, uh, coverage of the national and international news, I feel and does a pretty good job of analysis as well.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Are you in the car quite a bit\n",
      "or,\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I'm not actually. Uh,\n",
      "but I can run my radio in my office.\n",
      "I, I  teach at the university\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "and when I'm not teaching, if I choose to have the radio on I can listen to that station,\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, I see. Uh,\n",
      "How are you, are you satisfied with the TWENTY TWENTY and FORTY-EIGHT HOURS and the things that you do watch?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I, I, I pretty much am\n",
      "and I watch the news at least twice a day.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, uh, if I've missed something and, and I've just recently decided to stay home with my children\n",
      "and so it seems as if I catch the news right as it happens, you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "There was the explosions and that kind of thing.\n",
      "My husband will say how did you know about that.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "it happened at such and such time\n",
      "And that's so, that, that's different for me.\n",
      "So I usually find out exactly when it happens and that kind of thing.\n",
      "Is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in is, is the timely noting of the events as they happen?\n",
      "Is that what you feel good about in the news coverage?\n",
      "Uh, no\n",
      "it just seems like since I've recently stayed home, that is what's happened, you know.\n",
      "It's just that, uh, now that I've stayed home, I'm, I'm usually aware of when these things occurred\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it happened\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Well, I, myself, uh, the reason why I listen to N P R and the reason why I watch MACNEIL LEHRER, rather than the, than the network news shows at night, although I do watch a local ten o'clock in the evening news which carries over a lot of the national news stories uh, is that quite often it seems to me the national doesn't do a very good job of analysis.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "The local doesn't either\n",
      "but I feel that MACNEIL LEHRER get a little more deeply into some, some of the issues that are really current.\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "And perhaps newspapers do that\n",
      "but as I said, I don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper\n",
      "and frankly when I have read a newspaper I haven't noticed that kind of analysis either.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "So. Uh, there's, there is some danger to that, of course, too.\n",
      "Because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then, you know, how good is it.\n",
      "But, uh, I like a little more indepth coverage\n",
      "and I think that's what you're, maybe appealing to you too on something like TWENTY TWENTY or FORTY-EIGHT HOURS.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "It kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That kind of thing.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So. Uh,\n",
      "I'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world  rather than simply being aware that, you know, there, that an event has occurred\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I, I like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture.\n",
      "Maybe because I'm easily confused by detail.\n",
      "I don't know\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I know what you're saying.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "But I try and catch most of those programs on Wednesday's and Friday's\n",
      "and if I miss them, I try you know, I try and, and tape them if I'm out that kind of thing,\n",
      "I try and tape them\n",
      "and so I can sit back and watch them.\n",
      "And it's pretty interesting.\n",
      "When,\n",
      "you have young children, right?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the T V set for awhile without interruption.\n",
      "Well, yeah.\n",
      "Plus, I find that I have to video tape quite a bit of things\n",
      "Oh, you do?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "If I don't want any interruptions, you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That kind of thing.\n",
      "When is your good watching time?\n",
      "Uh, it seems like ten o'clock at night\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's what,\n",
      "Unfortunately,\n",
      "but that, that's what it seems like, ten o'clock at night.\n",
      "I have older children and getting dinner on the table.\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "I come from the east coast\n",
      "and I was,\n",
      "it amazed me when I got out here to the midwest and found out that even though they're an hour earlier in time, they still watch the news when,\n",
      "Uh, in Texas they do have the, uh, capital punishment\n",
      "and, uh, I, I I, I'm probably one that has to agree with it too.\n",
      "Uh, there\n",
      "some things that go on that I just feel that I, I, just feel, that, that, that is a need.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "A lot of people don't feel that way either\n",
      "but I just feel that\n",
      "Well I don't know how much publicity it's gotten outside of the state\n",
      "but California we just put somebody to death uh, for, I think it was a double murder.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, to be honest, I didn't pay that much attention, uh, to the details of it. Uh,\n",
      "but it had a lot of controversy out here.\n",
      "Uh, basically, because in California people like to protest about everything.\n",
      "Uh, but I agree,\n",
      "I believe that, that there are a number of crimes that capital punishment is the best way to go.\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "Uh, the big disagreement I have is that in California, the appeals process, uh, is so extensive and takes so long that you end up spending a huge amount of money in like ten to fifteen years before you can actually, you know, put somebody to death for, for a crime.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that is a consequence,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "And, I mean, that's, that's ridiculous.\n",
      "I mean if you can, you know, the trial is supposed to prove, you know, within a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty,\n",
      "and then they have appeals.\n",
      "Well, that's fine\n",
      "but it shouldn't take more, than a few years.\n",
      "I mean, I should think  two or three years maximum, you should be able to know\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and you should be able to either put the guy to death\n",
      "or he's innocent.\n",
      "I mean  it's, if he's guilty for, for, you know, multiple murders or whatever the case may be you know.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well maybe that's something that needs to be worked on.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But I, I just feel that, that capital punishment needs to stay within the system.\n",
      "Not all states have them\n",
      "but I, you know, was that, was that the, I'm not sure if that was in,\n",
      "was that the man that, that claimed he was abused\n",
      "or,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "he was like, uh,\n",
      "the   the  defense, the defense they're were giving, given was that, uh, like his mother had, had been an alcoholic when, when she was  pregnant with him\n",
      "And that he had\n",
      "he ,\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "and so he, he wasn't, you know, mentally competent or anything else. Which is ridiculous,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and, and the court found him competent, uh,\n",
      "and he knew what he was doing and everything else.\n",
      "I mean you know, it was, it was the best defense they could come up with.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And how long had he been appealing\n",
      "How long was that?\n",
      "I forget.\n",
      "I think it was something like twelve years or something.\n",
      "Gosh.\n",
      "Boy.\n",
      "It was, it was something really outrageous.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Boy. Well, I mean\n",
      "and it seems like it, it rarely does happen.\n",
      "You know, it's not, it's not used that often you know. At least here in Texas\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but I think it's something that needs to stay.\n",
      "I really do\n",
      "I think in general, uh, punishment in the United States is a lot weaker than it should be.\n",
      "I mean, it needs to be, you know,\n",
      "it's kind of like the, the justice system in the United States is kind of like the dog poops on the carpet\n",
      "and you wait three months\n",
      "and then you put his nose in it and spank him for it. You know.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean there, there's no connection between the two.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean you take these, you know, most of the people who are committing violent crimes, most of them, not all by any means,\n",
      "but, you know, a large percentage are the kind of people who are living very much day to day in the first place.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, they don't really see past next week much less next year.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And to say, you know, well if I kill somebody then a decade from now, I might face the punishment.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's not real.\n",
      "It doesn't have any real impact on them.\n",
      "My sister and I were wondering about this recently because a, an old friend of ours in California, this happened about a week ago.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, her husband just killed her\n",
      "and we're wondering if that has an effect.\n",
      "If that, if something, does capital punishment, you know, does it happen with that, within that, uh,\n",
      "I don't know\n",
      "Uh, you mean, would he be put to death for that?\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh, largely depends on the circumstances\n",
      "and generally, you know, from what I understand, it's, it's only the most brutal types of things usually.\n",
      "Where it's multiple, you know.\n",
      "I think you're right.\n",
      "If, if they can say things like, you know, well he was just, you know, temporarily insane because of, some domestic squabble then you know, they'll, they'll give him, you know, twenty years with, with parole in, in twelve or something like that\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, uh, I have an uncle that is an attorney that defends people\n",
      "All righty.\n",
      "Uh, I guess our topic today is air pollution.\n",
      "And we are to just discuss what substances do you think that contribute most to air pollution, as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Um, does your work entitle, uh, anything of environmental along these lines?\n",
      "Me, I'm in the legal department\n",
      "and, um, we do have, uh, a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I don't know too much about the air pollution thing.\n",
      "I do know for other types of pollution like the toxic waste and such that T I has to dispose of that we normally put in the ground, you know, we're coming up with a, uh, a new solution.\n",
      "We have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump\n",
      "and we just transport to these places.\n",
      "But after awhile it always seems that the, um, oh, the site starts to leak\n",
      "and then you have to clean it up and such.\n",
      "But the new idea is to take everything up to Sherman,\n",
      "and we're going have that, you know, incineration place up there and, dump everything there.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants from what I've heard, that everything would be in, in, you know, a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up.\n",
      "And that we won't be polluting the air.\n",
      "I'm sure we have to have, uh, permits, you know, for that place. And that there's, you know, limits as to what we can, uh, let, you know, go into the air.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's, uh, uh, uh, well,\n",
      "I work in , I work in environmentals, uh, projects right now.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "And so the Sherman deal is, um, uh, lost a lot of hair over that project.\n",
      "Oh\n",
      "Uh, what we run into, um, is we have the Texas Air Control Board, T A C B, that send out, uh, jurisdictions under which we have to, uh, uh, reply to.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And a lot of their rules and regulation aren't real clear, so we have our manager of environmental, who assist the T A C B, which is located in Austin, in writing\n",
      "and, hey,\n",
      "look what we've done here at T I.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, we are presently, uh, in receipt of a site permit, which will allow us to, um, uh,\n",
      "this is our side allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's in, in, in tons per year. Um,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "and so, you know, what we do to make contributions so that, basically, we go and do things like put in high-tech scrubber systems, uh, that, uh, scrub out the, N O X and, uh, V O C's and, and ammonia compounds, uh, like all the acids, to a certain level.\n",
      "We, are very, um, aware of the opacity, which is the thickness of a stack emissions.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or thereabouts.\n",
      "And so what we go through is, uh, if you see it smoking there's a problem.\n",
      "And having worked with some of the legal folks very closely, uh, it becomes a real issue, especially, when it's smoking\n",
      "and you have to get it fixed el pronto.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "As you know, they, they're allowed to come on site, the federaldes, anytime they want, drive through, and see, and inspect.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "So it's a full time, uh, everybody has their home phone number type of job. Um,\n",
      "Now is that place built\n",
      "or you're still on the makings of it?\n",
      "The Sherman facility, we are still in the, closer too, but still have a little bit of, um, finalization to do.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "It's been pitched to the Sherman City Council with, um, open arms, as well as the public.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "We had open forum\n",
      "and, and, uh, uh, Tom Jones, our environmental, corporate environmental guys handle the project.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, its real, uh, going real well.\n",
      "I think it's matter, just a matter of fund, funds right now as I understand it. Uh,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but it's, uh, it's something else.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "they're, they're, they're in the same issue.\n",
      "We were hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there.\n",
      "Uh, because the, the system is setup where it won't have any emissions.\n",
      "You're correct.\n",
      "It will have something coming out of the stackhouse it was, it was human nature.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "But it won't have can any, uh, any bad stuff.\n",
      "So, uh, I think T I, we spend, of all the major semiconductor firms, we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost, foremost, uh, uh, first thing we always look at.\n",
      "And we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the system of any other firm I know of.\n",
      "We eat and sleep the stuff, everything we do over here.\n",
      "and, uh, it's an interesting job.\n",
      "But um,\n",
      "Well, I know from some of the sites that we've had, uh, quite a list of cites that have gone bad\n",
      "and you have to clean up.\n",
      "And, you know the law now is the super fund\n",
      "and anybody who's contributed toxic waste, no matter if you were somebody that eventually, you know, uh, damaged the ground or not.\n",
      "Uh, everybody has to contribute\n",
      "and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've gotten, uh, gotten pulled into these super fund deals to clean it up and, you know, mega bucks to, uh, you know take everything out and redo it and, you know, fill in some other area\n",
      "and, um, certainly, it would to have a better solution, like the Sherman facility than, um, just letting it go in the ground.\n",
      "Because eventually, you know, it, it seems that no matter what they do, if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined, uh, dump area.\n",
      "It still only in time starts to leak out.\n",
      "Possibly.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "There, there was one site that they cleaned up\n",
      "and then the new place leaked again. .\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm familiar with that one.\n",
      "We have, we have stuff that's very interesting, uh,\n",
      "we have hoods,\n",
      "we have duckwork and all those type of interesting pieces of equipment where, um, they have, um, that we sample\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it may have over, uh, a certain emission levels,\n",
      "this is on the solid side ,\n",
      "and so we take it\n",
      "and, uh, we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid.\n",
      "And we mix it with concrete and actually, um, potash, per se, and concrete and then actually put it in the ground. But not so, not in a hazardous waste location because it's, basically, a concrete slab.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "It was totally legal.\n",
      "But the cost of doing this is astronomical, they actually show you what duckwork and things.\n",
      "Um,\n",
      "And so we were, uh, very, very, uh, cognizance of, and aware of all these types of, uh, expenditures because it could get very expensive.\n",
      "But I think we, uh, you know, we do all kinds of things to make the, the world a better place to live, you know,\n",
      "I think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that.\n",
      "I really would.\n",
      "Um, I've enjoyed speaking with you,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "This has been an interesting topic.\n",
      "Uh, I was one of the,\n",
      "I was responsible for all the planning and engineering over the corporate, or in the north building\n",
      "Oh, you were?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "So, uh, I hope you like your office.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "It's a heck of a lot different.\n",
      "And we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk.\n",
      "We were about the only, place in, you know, T I that had the gray metal desk.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "People used to come and laugh and go, gee, I hadn't seen one of those ten, fifteen years.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Glad to see y'all taken care of.\n",
      "Well, the, uh, I think what changed everything and, uh, is, uh, y'all were, y'all were the only ones that make any money for TI, here in the last ten years,\n",
      "We, finally got a little respect.\n",
      "Nobody thought of us as a profit center before.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "And that's, um, when, when you start, when you start paying your way, uh, you know, Jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I was just,\n",
      "Not just overhead.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "I've enjoyed speaking with you.\n",
      "You too.\n",
      "See you later.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "in order to make the, uh, curried chicken, I just fried the chicken, until it was nice and brown, you know\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "make sure it's nice and brown on both sides\n",
      "and then you take it out of the fat\n",
      "and you, you let the chicken you fried kind of drain, so that a lot of the oil comes out of it\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And then you, you, uh, pour most of the, all of the oil out of the pan\n",
      "and you kind of clean it out\n",
      "and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some, um, bell peppers and onions in, in that little bit of oil.\n",
      "Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons, let that brown, then put all of the chicken back in there.\n",
      "And then you, uh, mix flour and a cup of water, maybe, uh, one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water.\n",
      "Stir it real, real well.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Then you, uh, pour that in there, you know, to make the gravy.\n",
      "And you let it come to a boil again\n",
      "and then you let it simmer\n",
      "and you add, uh, about a tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And that's going to, it's going to be really good\n",
      "That's very spicy, too.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's,\n",
      "I mean these bell peppers and curry.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "and then if you like it really hot, you can add some hot, hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff.\n",
      "Oh, that sounds really good.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "I guess it was,\n",
      "is this dinner time for you?\n",
      "Uh, well it will be in a little while,\n",
      "I'm trying to get it, get it ready early.\n",
      "All done in advance,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "That's um, I, uh, I'm, I'm not that great a cook\n",
      "but I was single until I was thirty\n",
      "so I did cook a little, you know.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Uh, and I cook a little bit now.\n",
      "What I like to do mostly is stir fries\n",
      "and my wife normally says, oh, Tom, why, why don't you make a stir fry tonight\n",
      "and so we even, we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And we do a lot of, um, stir fry vegetables.\n",
      "What kind of wok do you have,\n",
      "is it, is it a real Chinese wok.\n",
      "It's, it's called a stir fry pan\n",
      "and it, and it fits right on your, uh, it fits right on your burner, whether it's gas or electric\n",
      "so it's, it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I see.\n",
      "And, um, normally what what we do is, um, just, you know, like two tablespoons of oil, maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular vegetable oil.\n",
      "But I will use peanut, peanut oil, or things.\n",
      "And then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and, um, green peppers, and, um, maybe put in a little bit of, um garlic and ginger, uh, beforehand.\n",
      "That gives, uh, uh, uh, spicier flavor\n",
      "and then after the stir fry is over, just mix in, um, a little bit of, uh, sometimes chicken broth, and corn starch and soy sauce\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and that sort of makes a, uh, a glaze, that sticks to the, the vegetables,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I've used,\n",
      "you turn them over.\n",
      "A lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu,\n",
      "we don't put in meat, cause I guess we're, I'm not\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, uh, she likes to watch all the, how much red meat and things,\n",
      "so. We'll do, a lot of times vegetarian.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and, uh, carrots and celery and green peppers and, um, oh, gee, mushrooms.\n",
      "Oh that's, That sounds real good except the squash,\n",
      "It's, it's a pretty big\n",
      "and we put that over rice.\n",
      "I just don't like squash.\n",
      "Oh, you don't\n",
      "I never did.\n",
      "My mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash\n",
      "and she'd have squash and corn bread\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And maybe some, she'd have chicken or something.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I'd just be,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "see, we never, in fact I never had squash growing up.\n",
      "My, my wife eats more vegetables, ate more vegetable than I did growing up.\n",
      "I'm, I'm from Pittsburgh\n",
      "and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Red meat and a potato.\n",
      "Oh, that sounds good.\n",
      "We, we were from North Carolina\n",
      "and we had a garden\n",
      "and my mother would, would, uh, grow the squash\n",
      "and she'd grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of,\n",
      "Oh, she had all of those types of vegetables.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "See, never, no vegetables in my family.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it was really funny.\n",
      "You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens\n",
      "Well that was a real farm.\n",
      "You ever seen anybody kill a chicken?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "but I, I've, I've heard stories uh,\n",
      "I've heard stories.\n",
      "And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "And then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub\n",
      "and finally it dies down,\n",
      "you get just a little patter\n",
      "and then it,\n",
      "Oh, this is\n",
      "you shouldn't be talking about this right before, while you're fixing dinner.\n",
      "Getting ready to eat chicken too.\n",
      "That's right,\n",
      "you should be careful\n",
      "That's pretty funny.\n",
      "But my dad used to tell stories, you know, about the way they eat chickens\n",
      "but I never, we never, we lived in the suburbs,\n",
      "we, we bought everything in a grocery store.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "There was no,\n",
      "but it was funny, you know,\n",
      "it so,\n",
      "but when we got married, you know, a lot more vegetables, a lot more, you know, a lot of changes.\n",
      "Well that's good.\n",
      "A lot of people are eating healthier now a days.\n",
      "I think so too,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but we just went shopping\n",
      "and we came back with, uh, with, uh, sweets, you know, chocolate covered peanuts\n",
      "and uh, we came back with sweets.\n",
      "Ugh.\n",
      "We didn't bring all the healthy food back too.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I'm trying to learn how to cook, um, deserts without, without all of the sweets, you know, maybe use honey or something.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "well that's, that's supposed to be, um, the trend of the future, but, uh, the cut back.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I, uh, recently was over a friends house that's Indian\n",
      "and, uh, she had brought Indian sweets into the office\n",
      "and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots.\n",
      "Ugh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that was a sweet\n",
      "and I was like ugh.\n",
      "This is a sweet.\n",
      "Oh it is, it's a candy,\n",
      "I'm like ugh, you know,\n",
      "Indian candy is not very good.\n",
      "Uh, right.\n",
      "But everything was, and everything,\n",
      "you didn't notice it at first,\n",
      "but everything was sort of hot.\n",
      "Everything had a little bit of curry in it.\n",
      "The spice,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "It was funny, even the sweets did.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "When you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it\n",
      "but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it.\n",
      "You know, it had that, that after taste that, very, it was a very Indian flavor.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Good,\n",
      "they didn't have,\n",
      "I didn't like her desserts very well,\n",
      "they were very, yogurt and carrots and pistachios, pistachio nuts and yogurt.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And it wasn't very good.\n",
      "Well I might have liked some of that\n",
      "I, I like hot stuff,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I really do.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well have we done our ten minutes.\n",
      "Oh is it ten minutes.\n",
      "Something like that,\n",
      "I think we're,\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "do we get a signal.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "normally they just come in\n",
      "and they say you've overextended your, your conversation.\n",
      "Oh, well this is my first one.\n",
      "Oh, okay\n",
      "well that's,\n",
      "you'll see it will normally, it will come on\n",
      "and it'll say you've over extended your conversation, you now have fifteen minutes to fifteen seconds to complete it.\n",
      "Oh wow.\n",
      "But, uh, I've been cut off twice.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So I just thought,\n",
      "in fact I'm just also,\n",
      "I'm hearing a siren outside I think my, my neighbors car must have got bumped, you know,\n",
      "he has one of those alarms on his car,\n",
      "Goodness.\n",
      "one of the, the neighbor has an alarm on a car\n",
      "and it's going off.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, I was going to go out and see what they were doing.\n",
      "Well, okay.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "hey thanks so much.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "thank you,\n",
      "it was nice talking with you.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "and you said this was your\n",
      "well you'll, you'll get a couple more probably.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I, uh, I called yesterday, I, or Friday,\n",
      "maybe I talked to somebody that, uh, I got them on, uh, during the day.\n",
      "It was a housewife\n",
      "and she was home with two kids.\n",
      "Ugh.\n",
      "And while we're talking the kids are screaming in the background, you know, that they wanted something\n",
      "and they were arguing back and forth\n",
      "and she just kept talking the whole time,\n",
      "it was pretty funny.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "kind of hard that way.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Hey thanks a lot,\n",
      "I'll talk to you later.\n",
      "All right,\n",
      "thank you,\n",
      "bye-bye.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "so, uh, do you own a P C?\n",
      "Um, no,\n",
      "not personally\n",
      "but,\n",
      "But you have one at work.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "uh-huh,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "several\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "and, now because, um,\n",
      "see I'm, I'm doing my, uh, Master's in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, um, and I, I don't have one,\n",
      "but I have to use them, like during, especially during my undergrad.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "You, you use, um,\n",
      "like your first couple of years you use personal computers because, uh, you know, the software.\n",
      "You know, like it's easier for you to go to and run a program, you know, through the disk, because, um, the grader can do it at home.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Then, as the, you know, as you go up higher, like in your senior level, you're doing projects which are, are so big,\n",
      "and you have to have so many people sharing the same data, that you can't use personal computers, so you have to use, you know, a main frame.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I know I, uh, I do have a, uh, you know, a computer at home,\n",
      "but it's one that the company has loaned me.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "And, that, that's been my situation, is that, uh, that way I can get in, access our, uh, computers that I have up here and, you know, do work from home.\n",
      "But does it have, uh, like, a disk drive?\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "Oh, okay,\n",
      "because, uh, the ones that we use, you know, are like UNIX base systems.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, so they don't have a disk drive.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "You know, so you can't,\n",
      "the only way that you can do it is through a modem.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And, you, you know, you just do it that way.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But, that's, uh, that's the only way that you can get to, through to the system,\n",
      "you can't store it anywhere.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "no\n",
      "I, um, I, I have both, because that, that's what I use all the time is UNIX Systems. Um, versus the DOS.\n",
      "But then I teach DOS classes, uh, at night.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "part time.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "And then you also have to do all your grading on the P C.\n",
      "Well, that, that's the really neat thing, I teach in the continuing education classes, so I don't, uh, I don't have to have any grades, no grade books, so that's great\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "But, no,\n",
      "I find that I use the, the personal computer a lot though for my WordPerfect, and also for my spread sheets.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Um, so I think it's extremely helpful and very useful.\n",
      "Well, uh, for us it's, uh, uh, you know, it's like for doing like, you know, like resumes, and, presentations.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, um. Uh-huh.\n",
      "We use like for example, a Mackintosh, which is a lot easier for graphics, than the than you know, the I B M P C's or anything compatible with that.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Due, due to the fact that, well, you know, I, I haven't tested the, the P S two yet.\n",
      "Um, um. Uh-huh.\n",
      "but I don't know if the software is as easily, you know, like you can manage it a lot easier than, than the old one.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "The old one you had to go pick a line, use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start, and where, you know, with the mouse you do it, you know, like, a hundred times faster.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "And, uh, you also get, you know,\n",
      "when you see it on the Mackintosh with, you know, the one I have,\n",
      "that doesn't have any color,\n",
      "you can look at it\n",
      "and that's the way it's going to print out.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, especially if you have a laser printer, it's going to print out the same way as it's on the screen.\n",
      "Oh, Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, so, with, you know, with the I B M what would happen is, uh, since the software that I had was, it was basically, you know, you only see part of the page.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, so, the whole page you, you never can actually see it,\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "you just draw it\n",
      "and they have to zoom out and zoom in\n",
      "and, you know, it's like, every time that you have to do something is, it's really a pain.\n",
      "What a hassle,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "And, also, you know, it's like for, for presentations,\n",
      "it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a, on a P C.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "it can be easily represented on a, on a P C.\n",
      "You know, like years back when you didn't have that you would have to map out all this, all these numbers.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and get a graph which you weren't sure if it was okay or not, you know.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But, with a, with a new system I can calculate everything so fast, you know, like for spread sheets.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "You can see what the trend is over the years.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, I love all the windows that they have out now too,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that, that\n",
      "they have really simplified things.\n",
      "I, I had a, I had a program due\n",
      "and uh, one, one window I had the program\n",
      "and the other one I had the program running. so if there was ever a mistake, I could easily check, you know,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I could look at the program and say, this is where I made the error.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Instead of saying, where did I make the error?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "You know, go back and forth\n",
      "and, and, you know, you always, you know,\n",
      "the old ones you had to go out of your program, load up, um, uh, well load up the program again, in this case.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "After you load it up change it, hope that's right, get out of that, run the program, run, uh-huh, as long as it took, and then go back and see if that worked or not.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But with windows you can have the program\n",
      "and say it messed up in line fifty-four.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, you take a look at line fifty-four,\n",
      "you take a look at the output at the same time,\n",
      "and you can see that, where it messed up, because, you know it's like in the old computers, the ones that, uh, we're using here a couple of years ago, you would always have to have a printout,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I know, I, uh, I remember my college days And having to do that too.\n",
      "did, did you learn it in computer science?\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "I sure did.\n",
      "And, when was this.\n",
      "Uh, I graduated in eighty-six.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So it's been fairly recent.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I know because, uh, all I know is that when I came here in eighty-seven, they still had, uh, it was the last year to, to put all your punch cards in.\n",
      "The cards.\n",
      "Oh, oh dear.\n",
      "I didn't have to bother with that at all, thank goodness.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, yeah.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "but it, it was just sensational because I walked in\n",
      "and they go, Oh, my God, they're still using this.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "It was like, this is the last year you can put your punch cards in and get your program out\n",
      "and, you know You can get a hard copy of it,\n",
      "Wow,\n",
      "wow.\n",
      "and that's about it.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "wow.\n",
      "So. But, I mean, the price of computers has gone down.\n",
      "They said that, um, if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since, you know, it started, they said that, uh, cars would cost two dollars\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they would run forever.\n",
      "Oh, that would be great.\n",
      "So, I mean it's like, you know, the, the joke with the Yugo, you know,\n",
      "it's like, yeah, you know, like when your, uh, car runs out of gas just throw it away.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, that, that's the way it would be.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "It's like yeah, I think I'll buy a new car today, you know,\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but I mean the price has really gone down.\n",
      "I mean, I B M which, uh,\n",
      "an I B M P C in like in nineteen eighty-one it would cost you five thousand dollars,\n",
      "Oh, sure,\n",
      "oh, sure.\n",
      "and now you can get it, you know, like for, one thousand dollars, because, you know, because of the parts basically.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and the two eighty-six too,\n",
      "so, yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "The parts and the labor is what they're charging you,\n",
      "they're not charging you, you know, over pricing, it because it's like, if we sell it for less, you know, it's like we're losing money, you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "It's like we want to sell it to break even at least.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, I think they stopped producing the I B M P C.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, and the, uh, P C Junior was a total failure, to them.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "They had, uh,\n",
      "they're trying to get out small computers,\n",
      "but, the only problem was that when they took that one out, the small computer was the I B M P C\n",
      "And, so, you couldn't, you know,\n",
      "it's like, sure bring out. into the market something that's smaller when nobody uses anything that's smaller than, you know, this, you know.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, so.\n",
      "Oh. Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, over the past years it's like I B M has been producing like\n",
      "every two years they bring out a whole new system. You know, like the P C X T, A T, and the P S one, P S two things, you know,\n",
      "and so. It's just that you have to always compete\n",
      "and, uh, Mackintosh took a lot of the market from a lot of schools.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Because of, of their, you know,\n",
      "you can work with it a lot easier.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "So, that's what they're trying to do.\n",
      "Oh, well, I'll leave you back to your work.\n",
      "Well.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And, uh, have a good lunch.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "All right,\n",
      "bye, bye.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Now, we used to be big time campers\n",
      "but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "What type of camping did you do?\n",
      "Well when we, before we had kids, we was in a motorcycle group, you know,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "we went like twenty or thirty at a time.\n",
      "We took, uh, just our little tents,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and we did it that way.\n",
      "Then when we started having children we bought a camper. You know,\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "and we did it that way.\n",
      "Oh, how neat.\n",
      "So, we've always enjoyed camping.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, I know I have, um, I just have a tent,\n",
      "and the kids and I like to go out and camp in the tent.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And then I bought a van\n",
      "and that way I can sleep in the van and be more comfortable\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "Now we have friends with a van,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van, you know.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Like one night\n",
      "and the next night they'll stay at the motel, you know, or something like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And they enjoy it.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I don't, I don't think I'm a real true, trooper, you know, when it comes, to camping.\n",
      "Oh,\n",
      "really, that's television\n",
      "I don't know\n",
      "in general on this project we're suppose to talk about\n",
      "so I mean,\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "I'm sorry.\n",
      "That's okay,\n",
      "don't,\n",
      "I mean, I, I always .\n",
      "Well, it's hard to talk about something,\n",
      "it's like me talking about taxes or something,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I feel bad cause I mean,  I should know something about T V shows.\n",
      "Oh, that's okay.\n",
      "I had one lady one time\n",
      "they called in\n",
      "I just signed up\n",
      "my husband had been on this project, um,\n",
      "and I, I, she called in\n",
      "and it was all about, we don't have children and it was all about, um, sending your kids to college,  and why you would advise them.\n",
      "And she was from Boston,\n",
      "and she, I shouldn't talk about this but she was, pretend she was a television show,\n",
      "and she was very snooty\n",
      "and, uh, her kids were going to places like Amherst and B U\n",
      "and I said I didn't know what that was\n",
      "I she went, oh,\n",
      "and I thought, um,\n",
      "so I know,\n",
      "I mean it's like don't worry about it\n",
      "television at least, you know, everybody's,  at least seen television. During the war did you laugh when they had that man on,\n",
      "uh, what was his name Wolf Blitzer?\n",
      "What was that?\n",
      "That guy that was a reporter for C N N.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "His name is Wolf Blitzer.\n",
      "Did you see it, him when he was doing the coverage of the Gulf?\n",
      "Um, I might of.\n",
      "I forget.\n",
      "Was he the guy that got captured?\n",
      "Uh, no,\n",
      "that was the other guy from C B S,\n",
      "oh,  what was his name, uh,\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "I can't remember his name.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but what about this Wolf guy?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but just ,\n",
      "they made jokes about him like on the CARSON SHOW and all of that,\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Jay Leno.\n",
      "You know, what my absolutely favorite show is?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "DAVID LETTERMAN.\n",
      "I love that guy.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "he's funny.\n",
      "And SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE,\n",
      "I use to watch that\n",
      "like I'd come home from second shift and watch him like for an hour and a half,\n",
      "he's great.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE has changed a lot if you haven't seen it in about a year.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "I mean I haven't seen it in a couple of months\n",
      "but,\n",
      "Has it gotten better?\n",
      "Uh, yeah,\n",
      "actually I think it has,\n",
      "I mean they finally like\n",
      "and some of those people\n",
      "they really have funny characters on there.\n",
      "Really.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they have one character on there\n",
      "they just call it Pat\n",
      "and they, you don't know if it's a man or a woman\n",
      "And they say well, they're trying to deduce what he or she is,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so to see if it's a female they say well do you carry a purse\n",
      "and Pat says no\n",
      "I carry a fanny pack\n",
      "So you still don't know because a fanny pack is man,\n",
      "or now days, you know.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "it's weird\n",
      "That's funny.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's, yeah it is pretty funny\n",
      "I mean they do some crazy things.\n",
      "Like when WAYNE'S WORLD,\n",
      "I love that.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "WAYNE'S WORLD, hey man\n",
      "And what's that other one where they, where they do the, um, skits,\n",
      "well, you've must have seen it recently?\n",
      "Well, I don't know,\n",
      "I've seen it off and on, I think.\n",

      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's, uh, more of a matter of what you, the steps that you do to keep yourself safe,\n",
      "and um, so that's, that's why I try and, uh, do,\n",
      "Well, the only thing that we can do as citizens is, you know, like, uh, watch groups that they'll have.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "But they can be dangerous too.\n",

      "you know, and, and I was thinking well, I need to call the police when I get back home\n",
      "and because it was about oh about four or five blocks from where we live\n",
      "and, uh, and I thought no, you know, because I wouldn't know if that was really a robber or not because it was in broad daylight.\n",
      "But anymore, you know, the crime happens in daylight, as it does in, in night,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, I watched it on T V, oh, I guess last year sometime.\n",
      "They'll break in at the day, in the daytime,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, I hear that, you know, it's if you lock yourself out of your house\n",

      "that's the one thing that I like.\n",
      "I'm getting me, uh, I want a German Shepherd.\n",

      "And he, um, ease very protective,\n",
      "The Cocker Spaniels are loud\n",

      "yeah.\n",
      "Very protective,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That's a deterrent.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Because they know that that dog's going to bark.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "But it's easy to fool a dog too.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "you know, throw them meat or\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "um, a a real intense burglar can just get another dog that's in heat.\n",

      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, I,\n",
      "New York does not\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, uh, they're, they're trying to reinstate it\n",
      "and the governor's opposed to it being that, uh, the Democrat that he is,  and Mario Cuomo\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, uh, I ethically don't like the idea\n",
      "but, or I should say morally I don't like the idea,\n",
      "but, uh, social and ethics, socially and ethically I think it's a good idea, in certain crimes.\n",
      "I'd, I would agree, with that even more,\n",
      "I don't know if this is cold and too pragmatically\n",
      "but I'm really offended,  by the thought that I have to support,  uh, just the existence of, you know, murder, rapist,  you know,  right, that, uh, after they've gone and done horrible things, molested children, and kill,  them whatever, that, society has to pay, uh, upwards , uh, thirty thousand dollars a year to incarcerate them.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Right,\n",

      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and Texas is having a problem right now\n",
      "and it's, the, the, the, the, the I think that's the, the repeat crimes and the repeat offenders is happening down here where they're, they're patrol, the state patrol board is letting people walk that have done, oh, heinous things from from killing police officers to, I mean just multiple, you know, molestations to murders of children, just, you know, really bad things\n",
      "and they're get, these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and now, they can't find them\n",
      "and they're finding bodies in you know,\n",
      "I mean, you think why they say it's because you're over crowd, it's over crowded,\n",
      "and you think how is, is everybody that stupid\n",
      "or is the world really that rotten\n",
      "I, I don't know,\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "it's a hard question,\n",
      "you look at the United States,\n",
      "we have the largest murder rate of any developed, uh,\n",
      "And then,\n",
      "or, uh,\n",
      "I don't know how Americans are about handguns\n",
      "but, uh, yesterday a lady I work with just told me today that, uh, in the state capitol here in Austin, Texas, they had been, uh, looking at a bill, uh, making it easier to accept the bill to access, to access handguns\n",
      "and they passed it, which basically means without an F B I check any person here in this state over twenty-one can get a gun\n",
      "Here in New York it's a lot harder than that, uh\n",
      "Is it,\n",
      "that's good.\n",
      "it takes, uh, it takes almost six months to get, uh, handgun permit, in this state.\n",
      "Say, that good,\n",
      "I think that's, like the state of Virginia,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "that's great.\n",
      "Now, the, the,\n",
      "and that's with, uh,\n",
      "you have to have, uh, oh, a police investigation,\n",
      "you have to,  have references,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I know, because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference uh,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I know it,\n",
      "there is, it's very easy to get, uh, uh, you know,\n",
      "there's no restrictions, whatsoever, on hunting rifles and shotguns and things like that,  which aren't the, I, I don't consider to be the kind of crime, uh,  weapon, you know,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "they're no,\n",
      "the cattiness behind,\n",
      "right,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "uh, so,\n",
      "I mean I don't like guns in general\n",
      "but when I think about, uh, this topic like capital punishment I look at somebody, I mean, I just remember when I was in college in a dorm\n",
      "and I think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him\n",
      "but in Florida, in the state of Washington when they had the Ted Bundy case\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and how they just\n",
      "well, it hasn't been just\n",
      "but it was in the, I think the second or third quarter of last year, nineteen ninety\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and I had, you know, I knew some people that said, why are you glad,\n",
      "you you know,\n",
      "this is nothing,\n",
      "and I said just maybe because he got a lot of media hype and all that\n",
      "but I actually, I mean in there should be more cases like that where they flip a I might be too cold too, but they flip a switch,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "well, and the thing with Bundy was though he escaped\n",
      "I mean,\n",
      "and then\n",
      "So many times.\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and did it again\n",
      "and, uh,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I mean, and that's just maybe because of the little more, they said celebrated that, uh,\n",
      "he's not the only one,  you know,\n",
      "No.\n",
      "you, you see somebody's mini series\n",
      "and you hear about somebody's crime,\n",
      "there was something on,\n",
      "and this gets back to capital punishment,\n",
      "but the man had stolen, uh, not stolen but kidnapped, uh, some wealthy ex-athlete's daughter somewhere in Florida\n",
      "and they changed all the facts that they said it was true\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they buried her alive\n",
      "Oh, God.\n",
      "and Peter Strauss had played the lead role\n",
      "and the man, and, and at the end of, you know how they have these mini dramas, at the end they said, this set person was paroled like six months ago\n",
      "and you're thinking oh, that's nice.\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "I mean, you know, I'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence\n",
      "but it does serve as a uh, definite,  you know, lasting\n",
      "Surely,  there's and end to, the situation.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "in that particular instance, uh,\n",
      "but I, but I don't, but I know it's on a\n",
      "and all and be all,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "that's the problem I have with it,\n",
      "in Texas they think it's\n",
      "and all and be all,\n",
      "they think that if they electrocute or slip, or do something, or gas somebody, uh, that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have\n",
      "and we happen to live in Dallas which is extremely crime,  ridden,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and we just moved here, uh,\n",
      "we've been here before, lived in Minneapolis, Saint Paul, uh, which has an exceedingly low crime rate,\n",
      "and then we were transferred back here,\n",
      "and when you're gone from some place like it for about six years as we were, you really begin to see, uh, just how problematic just living is,  even suburban, no matter where you are,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and how,\n",
      "you're in,  Rome, New York,\n",
      "Rome, New York,\n",
      "it's up state\n",
      "it it's, uh, near Syracuse\n",
      "is that\n",
      "and, and, is that like near Albany or Syracuse,\n",
      "it's about, uh,\n",
      "well, I, I actually live in a Village of Sylvan Beach,\n",
      "I work in Rome, uh,\n",
      "What, what type of area is that,\n",
      "It's more rural,\n",
      "is that in term,\n",
      "uh, it use to be use to be a, uh, uh, have a lot of heavy industry,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but it's kind of, uh,\n",
      "all the industry has gone south,\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "and, uh, now the Air Force is the largest employer in the, uh, area\n",
      "and, uh, uh,  so it's,   Not too bad,\n",
      "How would,  how is the situation in there in terms of crime and,  and things that would,\n",
      "it, you know, you still have the, uh, more drug problems and typical,  uh, small city type problems,\n",
      "not too bad.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but I don't know that there's a real, uh,\n",
      "Not the harsh criminality,  that you find in,\n",
      "no\n",
      "there isn't the harsh crime and all.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "now, Dallas is a\n",
      "I'm being very sarcastic,\n",
      "it's just a great,  uh,\n",
      "on some days, uh, it's, uh, I don't know\n",
      "the good ole boy network here is, uh, very strange, like I said\n",
      "they believe that, if they kill somebody, you know, tit for tat and,  deed for deed that,  that does something, uh,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that,\n",
      "I mean, they really are over,  crowded,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I mean, that's, that's just not a cop out, uh,\n",
      "and I just, you know, I'm originally from Pennsylvania which I think is basically like New York these days,\n",
      "I'm not sure if they, I don't think they have capital punishment there.\n",
      "I think, I think Pennsylvania may have just reenacted it\n",
      "because I'm from, uh,  from Pennsylvania also, just, uh, just outside,  of Philadelphia,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and I'm from Pittsburgh\n",
      "so,  oh, well, we'll forgive each other\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, because they use to be very, very conservative when I was growing up\n",
      "I and I can't, I haven't lived there in twenty,  years\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "but, uh,\n",
      "The west part of the state is\n",
      "and then the east part of the state has got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases\n",
      "so.\n",
      "There you go\n",
      "I don't know\n",
      "that's a different subject,  altogether\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "but, uh, I don't know\n",
      "I think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime.\n",
      "I think everyone would,\n",
      "you and I think are honest and candid because we could do it on, in this,  vehicle, uh,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "but I think everybody if they were touched by it would say, if they had any sense of rage that could be brought out,  I think every human does, I think they'd say, yeah,\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "do it if somebody in my family or if it happened it me, you know,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh,\n",
      "if your friends or family got, uh, had that happen to them I think everyone would,\n",
      "I, they'd,  probably pull the trigger themselves or flip the switch themselves and with a smile on their face,  as they did it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I just,  don't think that, uh, you can rehabilitate,\n",
      "I mean I just don't, uh, oh,\n",
      "I did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class,\n",
      "and I just,\n",
      "the subject,\n",
      "I remember we drew things out of a hat\n",
      "and it was something, uh, it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment\n",
      "and when you see how many repeat offenders there are, uh, check, check fraud cases where they go to jail for five to ten years and, uh, rape, rapist getting their hand,  just slapped, you know, and how it is based on the judge and if the time of day that the court is in session,  you know, all these, uh, intangible things\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and you're thinking, oh, you would not only would you not want to be a victim\n",
      "you wouldn't want to be a criminal either because you wouldn't know what you're getting, uh\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "but, I don't know,\n",
      "methods of capital punishment I have no opinions on that either\n",
      "I just\n",
      "Well, uh, I, uh, yeah,\n",
      "I don't know\n",
      "I think the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless\n",
      "because I guess it's a pretty,  pretty rough thing to be, uh, electrocuted.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Is it, uh,\n",
      "how about the injection,\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "an injection,\n",
      "is that suppose to be.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "that would be even,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I didn't even, think about that.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm not even sure, in the split among the fifty states,\n",
      "do you know which way it is the ratio,\n",
      "it's more than,\n",
      "aren't, uh,\n",
      "it's more that don't have it,\n",
      "I think,\n",
      "isn't that correct.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "there's more that don't have it\n",
      "but amazingly it's like, uh, Massachusetts went back,  and reinstated capital punishment, oh, maybe six or seven years ago,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I don't know if they've used it since then since they've reinstated it\n",
      "but, uh, it's on the books.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I don't know if they've, they did something about\n",
      "I'm not sure if Texas,\n",
      "Minnesota,\n",
      "I, they didn't, they didn't, they were\n",
      "well, did they have it,\n",
      "they were against it, uh,\n",
      "Texas, as I said, has it\n",
      "but I haven't been back here long enough to, to realize whether or not,  if they've done it in the last,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Well, I guess it depends on what age.\n",
      "I am in the thirty something,\n",
      "so I know,\n",
      "I mean I lived through it.\n",
      "Uh, are you old enough to know about the war?\n",
      "Uh, just barely.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I am, uh, twenty-nine.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So, uh,\n",
      "Well, yeah,\n",
      "you are old enough.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But\n",
      "But it was on the fringe.\n",
      "just, uh, yeah,\n",
      "exactly.\n",
      "Had some friends that were, that were in it.\n",
      "It ended, uh, when I was in, uh, college. In, uh, when I turned nineteen in nineteen seventy,\n",
      "I cannot even remember at this point. Uh,\n",
      "when I turned nineteen it was the year that, uh, the draft was still going on.\n",
      "If I had been a male or in Israel, I would have been number two.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Wowie!\n",
      "So I learned a lesson in gender\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, in terms of the war, I do not know. Uh,\n",
      "actually I do not really know that much about it.\n",
      "I just know socially the impact it had here and what you hear in the media, you know. Uh,\n",
      "I guess I think it was, uh, uh, not that great that we were in there, uh, in terms of for how long it lasted.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "You know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "What do you think?\n",
      "Well, I think it is, uh, basically the same way.\n",
      "It is certainly has affected, uh, U S policy though.\n",
      "There is, there is no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached the, the thing in, uh, Iraq.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Because, uh, the whole thing that was bad about Vietnam, it was no different from Iraq.\n",
      "I mean it was, uh, one country picking on a smaller, weaker one.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "The devastation,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "The only difference was that the government said, okay\n",
      "if we were going to support this smaller country, then we are going to support it a hundred percent.\n",
      "And we are going to consider ourselves against, in war, against these people as well.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And in full faction,\n",
      "Which, uh,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Which really was not the attitude with Vietnam.\n",
      "It was sort of, of a president's war rather than a country's war.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it just kind of dragged on.\n",
      "Uh, I do not know how you were historically.\n",
      "But I was a little bit older before I realized just how long it had been going on since L B J and\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It seemed to me like it was, it seemed like it was going on forever,\n",
      "I mean, I\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "It really, well,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "in fact, because in terms of when your,\n",
      "there is at least ten years between us,\n",
      "so in terms of when you were in school, I am sure that it was, you know, the majority of your high school and junior high years.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, one of the things I did not like was the weapons, the weapons, I can't even say it, the weaponry systems that they used.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, it just did not seem that, uh, I do not know, technically we knew what we were doing either.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And then you heard about the things like agent orange, et cetera,\n",
      "and you would think, you know, just, uh, how could the government or the Pentagon, uh, or whomever is in charge there been so careless.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "Uh,\n",
      "Of course now uh, now everyone's more, uh, you know, environmentally uh, intelligent than they were back then.\n",
      "Conscious,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "I mean back then it was not commonly known that saccharin was bad for you and all these other things that people that people know about themselves now.\n",
      "Nutrisweet,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "and all these other things.\n",
      "That is true, uh,\n",
      "Uh, monetarily too, I just do not think we have done enough for the, uh, Vietnamese people as a whole. Uh, in South Vietnam, in general, in helping them restore themselves.\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "You know, and I don't know if it is because there are not any oil fields there\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I do not know if they, uh, I do not know if they have that resource or not.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean I do not think they do.\n",
      "But I just think it is kind of a shame that, uh, you still hear things about the children that are orphans there\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "uh, so on a whole, I do not know, war is not good.\n",
      "And that one I probably,\n",
      "uh, my main opinion would be we should not have done it.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Well, that is what I know about the Vietnam War\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Unless you,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, you know a little, uh, a little bit more than I do,\n",
      "explain it.\n",
      "I did not, uh, get to live through it.\n",
      "That the people that I know that it did, uh, felt very strongly.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Most of,\n",
      "I work for a government contractor.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So most of the guys I work with, are, uh, oh, at least some of the guys I work with rather are veterans.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, Vietnam?\n",
      "And, uh, from Vietnam.\n",
      "Jeez,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "And, I have not talked to any of them that, that were not, you know, glad that they went or, or rather thought that the reason they went was a good one.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "You know, most of them are very strongly that, that the reason for America to be there was a good one.\n",
      "And that, that,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "They just felt that the way America backed them up was not, was not at all right.\n",
      "In terms of the personal.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "In term of, uh,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "The bitterness is more on a personal level than on a,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Personal level\n",
      "and, and the finances, how they started. You know,\n",
      "like air attacks and stuff like that dropped off like crazy.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Because the Congress would not approve, you know.\n",
      "The money is\n",
      "So, Yeah.\n",
      "after,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "I mean, I think it started actually like, like in the late fifties. I mean like in fifty-eight, fifty-nine.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "I, I,\n",
      "So it really,\n",
      "I mean, because I know, in nineteen sixty-three, I mean I was nine years old, when Kennedy was shot.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, I mean I remember, uh, right around then that's when I first started hearing about Vietnam.\n",
      "But then as I got older and studied in school, I realized it was even going on before that.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You know, and you think to yourself, oh, my goodness, Eisenhower\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "That sounds ancient,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "And I know, I know, you know, a lot of the Vietnam vets that are my age in their later thirties, uh, guys that I know, that, they are just kind of bitter, you know.\n",
      "They, they, you know,\n",
      "I hate to that movie BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY,\n",
      "but it is that kind of idea.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "You know, they just do not feel that socially they were given,\n",
      "like a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "They were not given the,\n",
      "right,\n",
      "the ticker tape parade and all that.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, well, I won't keep you any more.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That is probably as about as much as we both know\n",
      "But thanks for talking to me.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Uh, were you calling from Texas?\n",
      "Uh, yes,\n",
      "is that where you are at?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I am in Falls Church, Virginia.\n",
      "Oh, I know where that is.\n",
      "That is beautiful where you are at.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "right in, right near D C.\n",
      "D C,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Are you a native of there?\n",
      "Uh, pretty much,\n",
      "yep.\n",
      "Been,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh, Dallas, it is, uh, ninety-two degrees here today,\n",
      "but at least the humidity is, uh, below forty percent, which makes it kind of like Phoenix.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It is about the same weather here.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Little bit, little bit cooler, like eighty-nine.\n",
      "Well, you,\n",
      "But, basically the same thing.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well you are not missing too much then\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Really.\n",
      "Well, take it easy.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Uh, do you want to give a start on it?\n",
      "Well, I think for me,\n",
      "I, I'm from Alabama.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "South Alabama,\n",
      "and so I grew up in the midst of civil rights movement. Uh, in a pretty liberal family for, for that area at the time.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And so I was very much a part of all the, uh you know, what was going on there.\n",
      "Uh-uh.\n",
      "Uh, my parents are pretty active\n",
      "and, uh, it was very scary\n",
      "and, but now we've seen, you know, uh, black people have a lot more civil rights in that area and I guess all over than they did, you know, twenty years ago.\n",
      "Oh, definitely.\n",
      "There's still a lot to be you know, to be accomplished,\n",
      "but for me, when I think about social change, that's what I first think of\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "because I can remember, you know, separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and sitting in the back of the bus and everything.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "You can relate to that.\n",
      "Now see, we didn't, we don't have any of that because, well, like, we live in the country in Clarion County\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, we really didn't have things like that going on that we, you know, uh, ran into.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So we kind of, uh,\n",
      "I guess when I think of social changes, I think, think more of, uh uh, visiting habits of families and such.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, that's true.\n",
      "Uh,\n",
      "That's a good one right there.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that there's less visiting done, I think, on a whole than there used to be.\n",
      "Used to be that you took the family whether the kids wanted to go or not,\n",
      "you went visiting\n",
      "And, uh, today, you know, people, they do visit,\n",
      "but it's not quite the same as, uh, what it was, say, twenty years ago, thirty years ago.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And I grew up in, out in the country, too, basically, in a rural area and with lots of family.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "And so we were always at family in different family members' homes.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But even now, you know, they don't even do that.\n",
      "Well, they're so spread out,\n",
      "I think has a lot to do with it.\n",
      "Well, and they're so busy.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "People, people's personal schedules are so busy.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Mainly because, I, a lot of it has to do, I think with more women working\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "in our family, you know, twenty years ago, not that many of the women worked.\n",
      "That's right,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "And now, uh, almost all the women work.\n",
      "The majority,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "And, so that means, you know, a lot of a lot of the social visiting and all was, I think, probably instigated by women at that time.\n",
      "Probably,\n",
      "because when you work you don't really care to go out and visit as much.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And now,\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "And, uh,\n",
      "And now, uh,\n",
      "I mean my mother does not work\n",
      "and, and she, you know, she's finds herself pretty alone a lot because most of her friends are working women.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But even just social visits, people don't do that anymore.\n",
      "You're right.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "huh-uh,\n",
      "they don't do as much.\n",
      "And people don't feel comfortable just to drop in on people anymore.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "There's a real,\n",
      "You have to make arrangements or have an invitation or,\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "you know, you don't want to, You want to make sure it's okay\n",
      "or,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "I guess we don't not to make, invade people's privacy or whatever.\n",
      "Well, that could be part of it.\n",
      "I don't know for sure what it is.\n",
      "I know our children mostly are scattered out at a distance, so we really don't have that even.\n",
      "We don't,\n",
      "Well, out of, out of fifteen grandchildren in my family, only two of us don't live within fifty miles.\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "And and most live within ten or, or twenty.\n",
      "Oh, that's pretty good.\n",
      "So, but that's, you know, that is rural, it's a rural family\n",
      "and most people didn't go away.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "I'm just one of the two out of fifteen that don't live in the, you know, even in the same state.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, apparently there must be work available, for those that are,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "There is in that area.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Because around here, there's really nothing for the young people,\n",
      "no good, I mean there's jobs.\n",
      "There's minimum wage jobs,\n",
      "but, uh, to make a good living, there really, around here, there just isn't too much.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I guess, you know, that would greatly affect social i. e., social change.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Probably the job market has and the, the economy has always affected, uh, social change.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Probably.\n",
      "So, well, there's the main things I can think of.\n",
      "I really tried to think of some other things\n",
      "and I couldn't really,\n",
      "Well, I think just, also, you know, the women's movement, too, has affected a lot of social change.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "definitely.\n",
      "Uh, people marry,\n",
      "Some good and some bad\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "People marry later.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I mean basically, I think,\n",
      "now, again, where I'm from in, in Alabama that's not necessarily true because people do still get married right out of high school.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "But now out here in Texas where I am now, that's very unusual.\n",
      "They'd rather get their life started first before,\n",
      "Most people get I mean get, go to college or at least get a job\n",
      "and even, you know, people are, seem to, a lot of people seem to be engaged for a long time before they get married because they do want to be financially set up.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, even to get school finished, I think,\n",
      "a lot of times it's better if they do finish their schooling before they settle in.\n",
      "Because a marriage takes a lot of effort and concentration\n",
      "and if you're busy with school it's, I think it's really difficult for a family.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "But probably, uh, you know, more women being in, in the work force also greatly, greatly affects social change.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Because it affects child care\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "Uh\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I know my, my daughter that lives in Pittsburgh, she has two little boys\n",
      "and they, they've been in day care since, you know,\n",
      "one's four\n",
      "and one's one\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and they've done well\n",
      "Now, I wouldn't want to do it that way,\n",
      "but, uh, she's quite happy\n",
      "and the children seem quite adjusted.\n",
      "Well, and they're, you know, they're, they're saying right now, we don't know what, we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation that's just now coming into the work force and in their twenties.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That's right,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "They are the first generation that basically grew up with day care.\n",
      "That's right,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "And so, you know, it remained to be seen exactly what that, what that does.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Now, I'm going to baby-sit my granddaughter.\n",
      "She's just eight weeks old,\n",
      "so this will be new for me\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, uh, but the others I'm too far away to help them out at all.\n",
      "Where do they live?\n",
      "Uh, well, I have a son and daughter that live in Pittsburgh. One in Maryland and one in Connecticut.\n",
      "A son in Connecticut.\n",
      "Well, they're not too far, though.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "but like Connecticut takes eight hours to drive home\n",
      "and, uh, it's too far to, you know, really go too often.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Pittsburgh's not quite so bad.\n",
      "It's just a couple hours.\n",
      "Maryland, maybe five hour drive.\n",
      "Well, I live like fourteen hours from home.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That's worse yet.\n",
      "In fact I'm, I'm driving I'm, I'm driving home tomorrow, so,\n",
      "Oh, are you really?\n",
      "To go be there for the Fourth of July.\n",
      "Do you, uh, stay overnight on the way,\n",
      "or you,\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I can drive it all.\n",
      "It's just me,\n",
      "You're young.\n",
      "So I can make it.\n",
      "How old are you?\n",
      "I'm thirty-five.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "well you're young enough yet to\n",
      "Although it's, it's, it is pretty,\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "I don't enjoy it that much.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's pretty much like get there\n",
      "and,\n",
      "It's work to get there.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's just not that pleasant.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Even with other people, I basically just don't like to drive that far.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Now my son,\n",
      "they, they, flew,\n",
      "he rebuilt a Aranca Chief, airplane,\n",
      "and they flew down last weekend.\n",
      "They came down in it.\n",
      "And it still took a long time because it's not a fast, it's not a high-speed airplane.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But they enjoyed in thoroughly.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "When you say you're in the second phase of this project, what is the second phase of it?\n",
      "I'm not sure,\n",
      "but you have to change phones.\n",
      "You have to call from another, a different,\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Wondering how you keep up on the news.\n",
      "Primarily with our local newspaper and T V.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I listen to the radio but not, um, not like I did when I was working.\n",
      "I am recently retired\n",
      "to that means I have a lot of time to watch the news on T V.\n",
      "How do you gain your news?\n",
      "I guess the, I get the WASHINGTON POST\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "and that is a pretty big newspaper\n",
      "and I think that's almost exclusive me, my first of the news.\n",
      "Though I have the radio on when I go to work, I don't think the news usually hits,\n",
      "because I'm not going right on the hour.\n",
      "Oh, I see.\n",
      "You know.\n",
      "Well, that's, that is one of the handicaps with both T V and, and radio.\n",
      "If you're not available on the hour or half hour, then you lose out on an awful lot.\n",
      "Well, what is your newspaper?\n",
      "That is the WASHINGTON POST\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "is that correct?\n",
      "I have read that when we were in that area,\n",
      "and it is a splendid newspaper.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, what more do we need to discuss tonight?\n",
      "That seems like a very short one.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I think that, you know, we, we've resolved the issue\n",
      "and that's what we were asked to do.\n",
      "Well, I can discuss a lot of the news that we have,\n",
      "but, uh, I feel that that's not part of our responsibility.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So thank you for calling.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Well, thanks for discussing it.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Good-bye.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, Carolyn, the, uh, one of the main things I'd like, like to know is, uh, how do you feel about the, knowing about the environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth.\n",
      "Well.\n",
      "What do you think would be required, and so forth?\n",
      "Uh, I'll tell you,\n",
      "I, I watched what went on, um, with the TWENTY TWENTY show, I don't know if you saw that a few days ago that, that talked about nursing homes,\n",
      "and actually they specifically talked about some in the area where I am, here in Texas,\n",
      "and\n",
      "Oh, you knew of the homes, then.\n",
      "Pardon?\n",
      "You knew of the homes themselves?\n",
      "Well, I,\n",
      "no,\n",
      "I'm not familiar with those homes per se\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "but, um, they were in the area where I live uh,\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "and it was really revealing to see some of the, you know, the things that go on, I guess, in some of these homes,\n",
      "so I would definitely, you know, want to really check things out and, uh, go,\n",
      "I guess that the big thing would be once you got someone in a home like that, to, to make sure that you went daily, you know and made sure that they were cared for,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Well, from your point of view, how would you feel about actually sending someone that, that's, you know, means something to you to one of those homes.\n",
      "I realize that you indicated you wanted to check out as much as you can about it\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, of course, that makes sense,\n",
      "but how do you think they would feel, I should say, about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole new, new home situation?\n",
      "Well, actually, I have that kind of situation, because my mother lives with me,\n",
      "and she's eighty-seven\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "and, uh, from the time that we were tiny, she said, you know, I want you to promise that you'll never put me in a rest home.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So I know how she feels about it.\n",
      "You know, if I, uh if I ever had to put her there, I think, uh, it would be probably when I just could not handle it any more, you know, if I she got to the point where she was totally bedridden, and, and I mean, I just didn't have the skills or the strength to lift her or whatever it needed,\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I think that would be the,\n",
      "Well, how do you find that your, your personal relationship is with her, know that you're both together all the time and you are having to do a lot more for her than normal?\n",
      "Does that, does that cause any problems between the two of you?\n",
      "Uh, I wouldn't say any more than usual.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Is she,\n",
      "I think it's very hard for her, um, to be waited upon, so to speak,\n",
      "I mean, I think it's hard for her to have that role of not being able to do as much as she used to.\n",
      "It's hard to accept the fact that you're unable to pursue life, at the level that you did before,\n",
      "isn't it?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I think that's very true.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Um, on the other hand, it takes on almost a, a switch of a mother child relationship.\n",
      "It is different.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "I had that almost similar situation.\n",
      "My mother lives in an apartment with my sister\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "and, uh, so I, except for the three or four months this summer,\n",
      "that's the only time I ever spent with my mother,\n",
      "and, of course, since I see her only once or twice a year, I was just thrilled to have her here with me,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I spent every minute I could to be with her and, uh, cooking foods for her, you know, just to make her, her life as though she were on vacation.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But somehow another, it, that doesn't work between my mom and my sister,\n",
      "and they, they find they, they are,\n",
      "in speaking they,\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "my mother feels uncomfortable around my sister,\n",
      "and my sister's uncomfortable because her mother's there\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I guess it's just because they're there all the time.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So it's, it puts, has put pressure on both of them from that point of view.\n",
      "So that's, that's kind of bad news.\n",
      "And by the same token, my wife's mother is now moved into a nursing home,\n",
      "and after all she has been a farmer's wife for sixty years\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "and now all of a sudden she's had to move off of her farm, into another home where the environment is totally different.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "She's relatively happy,\n",
      "but she doesn't like the food.\n",
      "And when she complains about the food then they kind of get angry with her.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, that's another one of those things you have to solve.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, that's got to be a big adjustment for someone that's, as you say, lived on a farm for sixty years,\n",
      "and then go to something like that.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "after all, their, their life is so totally different\n",
      "because in those early days, the food, they had to make it from scratch, so to speak.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I mean, you raised your own chickens,\n",
      "and you killed your own hogs, I suppose,\n",
      "and then they they had to store the meat in, uh,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I don't want to say barns,\n",
      "but they had regular little places they, they would hang it, you know to cure it and so forth.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, and now, all of a sudden, it, uh, comes in differently,\n",
      "it tastes differently.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Do you have a, do you have any, uh, major preferences as far as television?\n",
      "T V, uh,\n",
      "trying to think.\n",
      "I was trying to think of some while they were calling you. Uh,\n",
      "I like Friday,\n",
      "what is it,\n",
      "is it Friday or Saturday night shows\n",
      "I think it's Friday night.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "All the, uh, the one with the two little girls in it, what's it called.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh, oh,\n",
      "Or three little girls.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "the, the two twins play the, the twins play that one that the youngest girl.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "I really like that.\n",
      "What's it called?\n",
      "Uh, I don't know,\n",
      "all I can think of is the name of ALL IN THE FAMILY\n",
      "but that's not it.\n",
      "FULL HOUSE.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "there you go.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I really like that show.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that is good.\n",
      "I, I like, uh,\n",
      "we have cable.\n",
      "I really like watching the old NICK AT NITE shows, you know. Where you get to watch DRAGNET and MISTER ED\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "and, uh, we, we can watch those all night sometimes if,\n",
      "DONNA REED\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, lately I've been getting into talk shows\n",
      "and\n",
      "Oh, yeah?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "just, you know, controversy and,\n",
      "Which which one does, which ones do you like?\n",
      "Just really whatever.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Just as long,\n",
      "it depends on the subject actually.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Where, where it's more interesting.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Some of them get pretty boring\n",
      "but,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh, there's that guy,\n",
      "I think it's out of Dallas,\n",
      "his name is, uh, oh,\n",
      "I wish I could remember his name.\n",

      "Huh, let's see.\n",
      "Oh, it's like,\n",
      "his first name's like Marlo or Marlin,\n",
      "I can't remember his name.\n",
      "Anyway, he always has like really strange shows like, uh, uh, male strippers or female strippers or just really sensationalistic, you know, like what Geraldo used to be.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "see, I don't, I don't like those,\n",
      "I like more controversial subjects, I think.\n",
      "I don't either.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, I mean, yeah\n",
      "Do you watch cartoons a lot?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "I'm, I don't watch T V that much, uh, anymore.\n",

      "But,\n",
      "I'm going to U T D here in Dallas.\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "My dad taught there for a while,\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "What did he teach?\n",
      "Uh, speech pathology.\n",
      "Oh, that's what I'm majoring in.\n",
      "I'm a graduate student in speech.\n",
      "Oh, wow!\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "No way.\n",
      "How long have you been there?\n",
      "Uh, this is my first semester.\n",
      "Oh, okay,\n",
      "so you wouldn't know him.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Who, Who, who, who, what, when did he teach?\n",
      "He, Uh, he taught about a year ago.\n",
      "He used to work at, uh, uh, University of Texas at\n",
      "what,\n",
      "no,\n",
      "uh, oh, shoot,\n",
      "I can't remember what it's even called now,\n",
      "but, uh, he worked there for like fifteen years and then part time U T D at night.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "And, and then they stopped funding the program there. Uh,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and so now he's at Texas Women's University.\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh, is he teaching speech pathology there?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "what's his name?\n",
      "Allen Bird.\n",
      "Bird?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "B I R D?\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "he published a paper, uh, couple of years ago, I think, didn't he, well, one that I read.\n",
      "Does he publish a little, quite a bit?\n",
      "Uh, somewhat\n",
      "and he has, he has some like different programs out,\n",
      "like I don't know what they're called,\n",
      "but they're like,\n",
      "and he has like little stuffed animals with them and like little cards and stuff.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I don't know that,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "okay,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "he has a test, he has a testing, yeah,\n",
      "a testing battery.\n",
      "He uses real,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I I remember.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, that's interesting.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, what are you studying?\n",
      "Uh, I was, I am studying nursing\n",
      "but I'm thinking about changing right now\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I just, I don't know,\n",
      "and it's really tough to get into the program down here\n",
      "so if I don't do that, if I decide to stay in nursing I'll probably come and go to T W U.\n",
      "Oh, yeah?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I'm living in the T W U dorm across from Collier, uh,\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "and, uh,\n",
      "My dad used to teach at Collier, too.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "that's, that's where the speech program is. Uh,\n",
      "I'm living in that dorm\n",
      "and there, all those nursing majors.\n",
      "I, I tell you what,\n",
      "that's, that's a tough, that's a tough, uh, field, though.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Nursing is.\n",
      "I, I have a lot of respect for those people.\n",
      "I mean, they've spent a lot of hours studying\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, you're at Baylor?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I'm at B Y U, in Utah\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Brigham Young.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I see,\n",
      "all right.\n",
      "So, but, I get to come home at, on the nineteenth\n",
      "and I'm so excited\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "I'm so homesick.\n",
      "Do you like\n",
      "it's in Salt Lake City, right?\n",
      "It's in Provo actually.\n",
      "Oh, is it?\n",
      "But yeah,\n",
      "I really, I really like it out here.\n",
      "Do you?\n",
      "But, I've been, I, I've been away too long.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I'm from Colorado,\n",
      "so I, I've been away from there too long\n",
      "Uh, how, how,\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "all set.\n",
      "Good morning\n",
      "Good morning.\n",
      "Let's see,\n",
      "music, um,\n",
      "well, I play a couple of instruments.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I try to.\n",
      "What do you play?\n",
      "Um, clarinet is my primary instrument,\n",
      "and I also play a little bit of saxophone, flute and piano when I get the opportunity, which isn't very often.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Really,\n",
      "that's too bad\n",
      "How about yourself?\n",
      "I play, uh, the violin and play trumpet\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "and I run a municipal band\n",
      "and I sometimes conduct.\n",
      "Oh, wow.\n",
      "So, I'm pretty busy too.\n",
      "I play in three different symphony orchestras.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "We have a nice big one here in State College, called the Nitny Valley Symphony.\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I play in the Altoona Symphony,\n",
      "was about forty-five miles away\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I play in a slightly smaller one called the Lockhaven Symphony and Community Orchestra.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So are you a professional musician?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I'm, uh, just retiring from Penn State University\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "only I, I should, should have been.\n",
      "I spend about half my time playing music or preparing for it somewhere.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, uh, I've been working at, uh, Penn State and using up all my nighttimes, and weekends uh, going to these orchestra rehearsals and, and concerts and so forth.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "I understand,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "I'm in one community band here,\n",
      "and that's just,\n",
      "well, we rehearse once a week.\n",
      "We generally have a concert every other week\n",
      "and,\n",
      "You have one that often.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "That's amazing because I, I, I have it set up here that we have at least six to seven rehearsals per concert.\n",
      "That's a lot.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "we sure don't.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Well, one thing is, we have a summer summer series,\n",
      "and every single Sunday night we play at the library to have a little out, outdoor stage set up\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "and so we do that every Sunday night during the summer,\n",
      "You are busy.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "and then, I don't know. We just have an awful lot of engagements,\n",
      "and we're just having to turn a lot of people down, um, because, you know, uh, we don't want to do things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row.\n",
      "Where do you get all this music,\n",
      "I mean, you, you must back up and play some of the music twice.\n",
      "Oh yes,\n",
      "definitely, we really do.\n",
      "You know, you get your little Sousa book\n",
      "and you just flip through it, and that sort of thing.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "So your, you don't play pretty well a full concert band music most of the time then.\n",
      "It really depends on who shows up.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, and it's always a mystery,\n",
      "because it actually doesn't matter who shows up,\n",
      "it matters what instruments they brought,\n",
      "because so many people switch instruments so often.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, um, yeah,\n",
      "in the winter we do more concert stuff\n",
      "and,\n",
      "How many people in your band?\n",
      "Um, I think there's about seventy.\n",
      "Seventy.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "there's a lot.\n",
      "Holy mackerel,\n",
      "that's.\n",
      "But, on any given night there's not seventy you know,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "it alternates quite a lot.\n",
      "Boy,\n",
      "that is a huge organization,\n",
      "that's great.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it really is.\n",
      "Because about the best I can normally hope for is about fifty in, in the band I have here.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well.\n",
      "But that fills a stage and keeps us busy,\n",
      "but they were, half have been professionals from, uh, a lot of them are from, uh, faculty at Penn State here.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "And so they want to play things that, uh, push them to do.\n",
      "So that's why we have to work real hard when we get a concert together.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "We have about four concerts per year indoors and two or three that we play outside.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And the last one we did was in a large, uh, mall close here,\n",
      "we played Christmas about an hour out in this mall.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "So that worked out very nicely.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's fun.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, let's see.\n",
      "Well, there's another band around here.\n",
      "Someone at work is trying to get me to join that one, because they need clarinet players\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and their concert schedule isn't as heavy,\n",
      "but they have more in the summer,\n",
      "I think they have ten in the summer, you know, one, one week after the other.\n",
      "I think they're like Monday nights and they don't have rehearsals during that time period.\n",
      "Wow,\n",
      "that.\n",
      "Are you just saying you, you sight read every concert?\n",
      "Uh, well, it's not really sight reading when you've done it, you know, again and again and again,\n",
      "but some people are,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "some of them are.\n",
      "And where, where does this happen, Laurie,\n",
      "is this in Dallas?\n",
      "Well, they're in the suburbs of Dallas, in Richardson and Plano.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "We're real close to Dallas.\n",
      "Well, I declare.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's amazing.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, it's more of a, I think it's very much more of a social group than anything else, you know.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And, and people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and hang around for an hour or so\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "and, That's probably why we get so many people.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Do any of your, you, in your group get paid for any of this?\n",
      "Um, well, the conductor gets paid a little bit, you know,\n",
      "we do get some money from the city because we do play at a lot of city events.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, I think he's the only one that gets paid.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And you do have to buy your music.\n",
      "Who, who sponsors you basically, the city?\n",
      "The city,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah, uh,\n",
      "my band is sponsored through what they call Parks and Recreation.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's a similar thing.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I can't remember what they call it,\n",
      "but the same type of thing.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, but we do get an awful lot of music, you know,\n",
      "we can borrow music from any of the area colleges\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "or, you know, if some, some group just isn't going to play any more, they'll just give us their music, and that type of thing.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And we do an awful lot of, you know,\n",
      "we don't charge for any of our performances,\n",
      "but we get a lot of donations.\n",
      "Well, I, I work the same way\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Well, I'll be darned.\n",
      "It's amazing.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "Well, what do you think?\n",
      "Well, providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task\n",
      "and I, uh, personally, I don't approve of it for two reasons.\n",
      "Number one is that I think that, uh, the federal government has a problem with the deficit right now,\n",
      "and if they were to administer this, they would, uh, get us more and more into debt, further than we can ever get out ourselves.\n",
      "Number two I think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would, would be dried up\n",
      "and really no one would be, would only answer to, to the government to a big bureaucratic mess.\n",
      "And, uh, I've seen what it has done in other countries\n",
      "and so I don't think, uh, I don't think we should head in that direction.\n",
      "Although that we have problems right now\n",
      "and I do agree that they exist\n",
      "because health care insurance for, for everyone is skyrocketing\n",
      "and it's become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "How do you feel about the whole ordeal?\n",
      "Well, I agree that it's a big task,\n",
      "but I think that, I think that the U S should move toward some kind of national health care plan. At least as a long term kind of goal.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And possibly, just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing,\n",
      "but I think that ultimately it would be a good idea to, uh,\n",
      "and not have a completely socialized, medical system in the country, maybe something about halfway between that and what we have now.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It, uh, just because it seems that, uh, health insurance costs are sky rocketing, well, as fast as the national deficit perhaps\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "and so that,\n",
      "and  that's a   that's a vicious cycle, of course.\n",
      "But what,\n",
      "What you're  Yeah,\n",
      "so what you're  saying though, is instead of having the national government, uh, government administer, giving health insurance to every man, woman and child with, throughout the whole company, you see more of them as regulating the high costs, uh, that people are forced to pay for it right now.\n",
      "Because,\n",
      "Is that is that correct,\n",
      "Um,\n",
      "or do you think that,\n",
      "Well, I, uh, well, I wouldn't exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately.\n",
      "I don't think that that would necessarily be such a bad idea.\n",
      "And, uh\n",
      "Well, with the, with the costs as they are right now, do you think that the government, uh,\n",
      "because what that would require is for us to pay, uh, more taxes\n",
      "and the, the the people that can afford taxes, the middle income and the upper income will be paying more taxes to, to pay for health insurance for everyone, whereas right now the, the public themselves get health insurance\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and they provide their own health insurance.\n",
      "The, well, as it is now, the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance\n",
      "and so that the other people have no health insurance\n",
      "and, you know, they'll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies\n",
      "and somebody winds up paying for that\n",
      "and basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance\n",
      "so I don't see that anything, that this situation would get any worse.\n",
      "That way it might get better.\n",
      "You think it might get better, huh?\n",
      "I, I kind of disagree\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "The reason being is, uh, we have,\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "I guess it's my, my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic rules that it would take to administer it\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, the, the health insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and, and, uh, don't allow cases where they might throw them out of business, whereas the federal government if they took over everything, they wouldn't care because they'll never go out of business.\n",
      "People would still have to pay taxes,\n",
      "the money would have to come from somewhere\n",
      "and so you'd\n",
      "I, I feel that the cost would increase dramatically also.\n",
      "But in the same sense the, the care and the, the attitude of the doctors and the professionals within the medical, uh, field would, would diminish.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, I think,\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "First off, speaking of air pollution I'm coughing .\n",
      "Um, I'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly.\n",
      "I find it hard to believe that a lot of the hair sprays and things that we use cause the air pollution.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it, it.\n",
      "It doesn't seem like,\n",
      "but I guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and it's kind of dangerous.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's true.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, I don't know.\n",
      "We live, um, well, I'm close to Salt Lake\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and there's mountains, uh, you know, all around.\n",
      "But sometimes I think tend to hold a little bit of it in, you know.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Really, it's, it's fairly clean, um,\n",
      "I think it's a fairly clean city compared to some,\n",
      "but, you know how quite a,\n",
      "But you think the mountains and the, are kind of a barrier?\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Oh .\n",
      "I think sometimes it seems to be\n",
      "but, But, uh, anyway, I don't know.\n",
      "That's an interesting thought.\n",
      "I know there's a lot of plants here,\n",
      "when I drive down you know, along the, just along the freeway, there's a lot of plants that they're burning things\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Here in Texas I know a lot of the, pretty much every place here is relatively flat,\n",
      "and so I would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a, like a smog problem or something like that.\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We, we have a real fog problem. Um.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "The last few years just in, through December and January it, it really is foggy and, and seems to just, um,\n",
      "it's kind of like it, it just stays for a month quite foggy.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, uh, gee,\n",
      "I don't, I don't know what else.\n",
      "I\n",
      "I know cars\n",
      "I\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I guess I've never really, uh, thought about the fact, like in California they, they have a lot of smog problems.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And it's real hilly there.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So that is probably something that plays a big factor.\n",
      "I think probably just, uh, a lot of factories, um, you know, they have the smoke stacks, I guess you call them and different things like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's, that's what I see burning a lot.\n",
      "I'm not exactly sure what they're burning.\n",
      "I know, uh-huh, there are some oil companies,\n",
      "and I'm sure that that contributes a lot\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "just the burning of the\n",
      "Aren't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of, uh, special gas or something that doesn't emit certain chemicals or something?\n",
      "Oh, I don't know.\n",
      "I haven't, I haven't heard that.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "I know, uh,\n",
      "I don't know how your emissions test is on your cars or anything,\n",
      "but I know I think they, they differ from state to state.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "But, um, you know, that's been a new thing in the last few years,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I guess some cars are a lot worse than others.\n",
      "I think those, uh,\n",
      "what are they,\n",
      "the,\n",
      "I know,\n",
      "a Rabbit's one, diesel\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "the diesel.\n",
      "the diesel cars.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they seem to put out quite a bit\n",
      "I know a lot of people with diesels\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "truck, you know.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "But, um.\n",
      "Well, do you, um, are you working for T I?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I don't.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "I, I work in Waco at a T V station.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "My mother works at T I.\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "That's why,\n",
      "And that's how you got involved.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You work at T I?\n",
      "No\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "we, we have, um,\n",
      "my husband's sister lives in Dallas actually.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And they kind of got it, us involved that way.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "That's interesting.\n",
      "but. Well, I don't, I don't know.\n",
      "What else causes air pollution? Um,\n",
      "Noise.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "noise.\n",
      "Noise causes air pollution\n",
      "I've got,\n",
      "speaking of noise, you can probably hear my little.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's why I thought of it.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "he is quite noisy.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "gee,\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "I know that, um,\n",
      "don't dumps, you know, where you dump all your trash in the, uh.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Landfills.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I'm sure that does.\n",
      "I know they're always churning that up\n",
      "We just.\n",
      "and I, I think they burn a lot there, too.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We just had a big, uh, thing here in Waco.\n",
      "They're needing to open a new landfill, or to expand onto the old landfill.\n",
      "And, uh, it's, it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded, because they're thinking that they're water is going to be contaminated somehow.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And so they,\n",
      "Well, I don't think I'd, I'd like that.\n",
      "You know, we, um\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "when we've taken things to the dump, just the dump, uh, that is, uh, you know, closest to us,\n",
      "there's some houses around there,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I know that on windy days, you know they're always moving the, the trash over to different spots,\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "and they've got those big bulldozers,\n",
      "and you can see the dust flying,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, and I'm sure that their homes are really quite  dusty\n",
      "One  one of the big concerns is they have a, there's a school right across the highway from the landfill.\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Oh, is there.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So the parents were really, really upset.\n",
      "Worried about their their kids getting, huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "They, they've been fighting over it for the last year,\n",
      "and they just now approved it.\n",
      "So they're going to try an appeal or something.\n",
      "We could talk about my favorite subject\n",
      "Cooking and food, huh.\n",
      "Food\n",
      "What do you like to cook?\n",
      "Uh, I don't cook a lot actually.\n",
      "I have just started baking,\n",
      "so, uh, I am kind of interested in cakes and, uh, muffins and stuff like that,\n",
      "but I can't seem to get them exactly right.\n",
      "So, I am just trying to perfect some things.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I tried to make an applesauce cake. Which I will never ever try to make again.\n",
      "It was horrible\n",
      "Oh dear.\n",
      "I don't know if the cake was horrible or if I made it horrible.\n",
      "Oh, probably not.\n",
      "I, uh, have, uh, a bread recipe that is real easy that everyone always really does like. That, uh, doesn't require kneading the dough.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Hey\n",
      "And, it is always, it is wonderful.\n",
      "It is,\n",
      "and what is funny is that you use, uh, bran, all bran\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it looks like it is a wheat bread.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "But, it is actually all bran flour\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, you know, it is just regular\n",
      "the type that, you know, yeast and that sort of thing\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and you let it rise\n",
      "and you can let it rise in the refrigerator and then punch it down, and then, uh, make your rolls.\n",
      "They really are good\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "and they are so easy to do.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That is\n",
      "seems like every time that we have a dinner party, or that we are going some place where everybody is suppose to bring something and they have had my rolls before.  They always ask me to, bring those rolls\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "They request it.\n",
      "I have not gotten any requests yet.\n",
      "Last year, I had a Christmas party, at, uh, my office,\n",
      "and I, uh, made the tuna fish sandwiches.\n",
      "And everyone, uh, I mean, I think, everyone knows how to make tuna fish,\n",
      "so I thought that would be easy for me to make\n",
      "and I can not go wrong with that,\n",
      "and so I made it\n",
      "and, uh, I used celery seed in my,\n",
      "Do you use celery seed in your tuna fish?\n",
      "No\n",
      "I haven't.\n",
      "And I just thought it was so strange,\n",
      "because I never, I thought that that was what celery seed was for.\n",
      "Was for tuna fish.\n",
      "Oh, how funny.\n",
      "And so, but everyone really, really loved the tuna fish\n",
      "and they just couldn't get over the fact that I used celery in it\n",
      "and it just surprised me.\n",
      "Celery and onion and,\n",
      "Well, see I, I have always used celery, I mean, I have used celery before.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But I never used the celery seed in it.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, what else do you put in it besides the celery seed.\n",
      "Just like, uh, really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed\n",
      "and I use like, uh, Miracle Whip salad dressing instead of the actual mayonnaise because I really don't like the Helman's Mayonnaise.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But if you use salad dressing with kind of, uh, you know, kind of, I guess a tart taste. Then it comes out real good.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, I, uh, it was the first time I have I have ever found out that the, the, nobody else used celery seed.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, having been there not too long ago, and my wife having only recently completed a doctorate, I'm fairly full of it, of it myself.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Uh, the main point that I have about choosing where you want to go to school, is that, you have to early on define what it is you want to do or at least what area you want to be in.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, I had the unpleasant experience of going through several schools that were very specialized.\n",
      "I went through a number of them, uh, undergraduate schools, before I found a, a good school that was more general, uh, to give me time to make up my mind.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Oh, that's interesting.\n",
      "I went to a, a liberal arts school, actually, at first,\n",
      "and you weren't really even, um, they didn't expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until you were in your second year,\n",
      "and then you, you know, you had, I think you had to pick it, by, by, by the end of the second you had to pick some sort of major,\n",
      "but until then they didn't sort of force you.\n",
      "They, they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then. Certain requirements,\n",
      "so that, so that you had to sort of get a general feel for everything,\n",
      "so it wasn't that specialized.\n",
      "So that,\n",
      "That's wonderful.\n",
      "I'm a great proponent of liberal arts education, for anybody.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, being an engineer now, I believe in it even more strongly than I did before.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I was just on a committee recently, actually sponsored by, uh, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, trying to sort of, you know, where, where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together, you know, because there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts,\n",
      "and then the other way around as well,\n",
      "people are getting pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "Well, thus far it's working to my advantage.\n",
      "Uh, the great gap historically has, with engineers, has been while they may have all this technical information, they have no way of imparting it to, except to another engineer.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I have the ability to listen to them and then translate that into something that nonengineers can understand.\n",
      "Well, that must be helpful.\n",
      "Well, it's,  a lot of fun, at the moment.\n",
      "That could be very helpful .\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, I figure that, that, that's probably the thing I would most tell any parent, you know, to tell their kids, I think, probably\n",
      "make sure the kid goes to a school where they get sort of a general education\n",
      "and save specialization, I guess, for graduate school, unless they're sure they want, early on they want to do something like engineering or something.\n",
      "Or they can,\n",
      "Even at that, I have a son, that, who's only nine at the moment.\n",
      "But I see him very rapidly becoming the engineering personality,\n",
      "and, uh, if he decides to pursue that, I'm going to insist that he spend two years at a liberal arts college, before I'll even let him go to an engineering college.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "And, yes,\n",
      "that'll add one year to his education experience.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but, but that's a good idea.\n",
      "Well, where I am right now,\n",
      "actually I'm at the University of Rochester,\n",
      "and that's a pretty good engineering school, I think.\n",
      "I think we do some  they have pretty good engineering here.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "it is.\n",
      "They also have a fairly large liberal arts college as well. A sort of, a separate, you know, arts and sciences college.\n",
      "Um, and I believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in, in everything,\n",
      "and I know people, I do, uh, I do work in language processing,\n",
      "and, and, and at least one person who's in my field started off as an engineer, started off as an an electrical engineer student, and then switched over at some point into language processing, because he found that he enjoyed it more.\n",
      "So they do force them,\n",
      "people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here, which I think is wonderful.\n",
      "Oh, I agree.\n",
      "Uh, I have the experience, uh,\n",
      "the last school that I went to was Mississippi State University which is historically an engineering and agricultural school.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh, the typical land grant university,\n",
      "every state's got one.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Anyway, while it has both engineering and liberal arts, the engineering students tend to cluster together.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You know, they're in classes together, even when they're outside of the engineering department.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And they don't learn the communications,\n",
      "they don't learn the thought processes of other fields of, of endeavor.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "It's, you know, it, that's kind of like if I were king for a day, and got to, and got to make one rule. My rule would be, no one could get out of high school without an entire year of philosophy.\n",
      "Um, uh-huh.\n",
      "That would,  be very good actually.\n",
      "And it's,  that's not even true in our colleges.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "you, you don't need any philosophy at all in school.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Or\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "or, or, or, or some other thought provoking area, you know.\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "We had, uh, when I went to undergraduate, we had uh,\n",
      "went to Brandeis,\n",
      "don't know if you know of it or not, uh,\n",
      "we had, uh, uh, a requirement freshman year of just Humanities.\n",
      "Then you were given a choice of, um, you know,\n",
      "there were ten or twelve, or whatever, or fifteen different courses that you could take,\n",
      "but they all centered, they all came out of Philosophy, English, and Literature departments,\n",
      "and they were, they were, they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read, you know for,\n",
      "so the first year Humanities courses everyone had to read the Iliad an, and so forth,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and what they did do, was they all approached it from, from very different,\n",
      "so that you could have one class in the philosophy of something, that the philosophy of Greek mythology or something that actually approached this, or, um, one literature, you know, or a, a literature course or, just all sorts of different perspectives on it,\n",
      "and people got to pick and choose,\n",
      "but, but by the end, everyone had a good sample of, of, of, sort of how to think about these things nonscientifically, you know,\n",
      "and, uh, and that sort of forced them.\n",
      "But I believe that, that, that you, one of the, one of the best things to do, at least for me in school was, was, I was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses.\n",
      "Um, I was forced to take, I think you know, some sort of art history course,\n",
      "and we all grumbled about it at first,\n",
      "but then, afterward, we all wound up taking extra art history classes, because it just seemed like something, something we didn't totally know nothing about, but just enjoyed very much doing,  and something I would never would have done if, if I wasn't forced to take it.\n",
      "Yes, I  I remember that experience\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "that and, uh, extra music classes.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And that, and that really is something that, that I notice,\n",
      "like I talk to a lot of my friends at school that are more specialized,\n",
      "and they don't have that.\n",
      "They just, you know, they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take,\n",
      "and that was all.\n",
      "They never had some of the more fun classes, I guess .\n",
      "I feel a little more worldly now\n",
      "Well, that will continue to grow even as you go beyond graduate school.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I'm, I'm, I'm hoping, I'm hoping.\n",
      "Have, have you gone straight through?\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I, I graduated, um, college in eighty-seven,\n",
      "and I just went straight through.\n",
      "Um, I'm finishing up next year.\n",
      "So, yeah,\n",
      "I didn't take any break or anything yet.\n",
      "I've been trying actually, in graduate school, I've been trying to do the same thing, take courses, completely outside my area,\n",
      "and I'm finding in graduate school it's a lot harder, because, uh, I just don't have the time any more to sort of sit in a course, that I'm not getting graded for.\n",
      "Whereas before I would just sign up for credit for it, now I can't sign up for an art history course for credit necessarily.\n",
      "So I have to try and go myself,\n",
      "and I went for like two or three weeks and realized, not enough time for the work unfortunately.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "Are you pursuing a Master's or a Doctorate?\n",
      "I'm pursuing a Doctorate in Psychology.\n",
      "So, I'm just, wind up spending a lot of time doing that instead.\n",
      "Uh, what else.\n",
      "I, I think I,\n",
      "Well, let me, let me encourage you to stop and experience life along the way.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "I, I first enrolled in college in nineteen sixty-six.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, six years, and a, and a war later, uh, I got a degree, an undergraduate degree.\n",
      "And then fifteen years after that, I got the first of a set of master's degrees\n",
      "and four years after that I got another master's degree.\n",
      "Um. You had real world experience in the middle there.\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "And that helped, you think?\n",
      "Or that was,\n",
      "It, it certainly makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um. Yeah,\n",
      "I'm getting some of that.\n",
      "Um, I have, I have sort of some, work experience .\n",
      "My wife is not an academic at all.\n",
      "My wife is sort of in the real world,\n",
      "and so I sort of hinge halfway out in the real world\n",
      "and I, getting, you know, real world .\n",
      "Especially she works in, uh, uh, she works in the, she works for a temporary agency,\n",
      "and I never would have had,\n",
      "she's the office supervisor,\n",
      "I never would have had any, I've, I've learned much just sort of by watching her and her, and her business as well.\n",
      "So yeah,\n",
      "so I, I can, I can see where that might be a,\n",
      "Well, vicarious learning is a wonderful thing.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "It certainly means that we don't have to experience everything,\n",
      "but experience is a wonderful, teacher also.\n",
      "That's my,\n",
      "oh yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "agreed,\n",
      "agreed.\n",
      "Well, I'll, I'll take that, I'll take that and think that through a little bit. Uh.\n",
      "My wife, as I may have mentioned, just finished a doctorate a couple of years ago.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "and she pursued her education along the lines that I did with lots of break in between.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And she feels reasonably comfortable teaching now.\n",
      "She has an awful lot of experience to draw on.\n",
      "No longer\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, I take it since you selected this topic that you have children.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I don't,\n",
      "You don't?\n",
      "but I have nine younger brothers and sisters.\n",
      "My goodness.\n",
      "So. Well, I have two daughters\n",
      "and, um, they're past this, they've been latchkey children for a while,\n",
      "and they're almost where I can start saying they're, you know, young adults,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so I don't have to worry about child care too much anymore.\n",
      "Um, we're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask, or expect.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I would assume it's, you know, if you were looking for a day-care center or something like that.\n",
      "Well, if I were\n",
      "Or probably even baby-sitters would be the same thing.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Um, I think my, my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I would think someone older\n",
      "and I would want to know if they've had any past experience with children.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I think that varies.\n",
      "I think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "that's true also.\n",
      "Um, you know, it's, it's, once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's, you know, really, really qualified per se.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, with a, with a baby, definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "Well, um, I did a lot of baby-sitting when I was younger.\n",
      "I'm twenty-two now\n",
      "and I did most of my baby-sitting when I was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen.\n",
      "But, um, the only thing people ever asked me,\n",
      "well, of course, they knew I came from a family with younger kids,\n",
      "but they really didn't ask me if I was used to children or not.\n",
      "The only other thing they asked me is what I would expect in pay.\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "You know, and, um, I was pretty surprised because if I had a child and someone, you know, I would want to know, I personally would ask for people that that person has baby-sit for before.\n",
      "Well, I, my experience, I baby-sat a lot also at, when I grew up\n",
      "and, um, coming from, you know, that background and the background as a parent now, I think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a, a lot of times baby-sitters,\n",
      "I know I did this with my children,\n",
      "it's, you get somebody where you kind of know the family already.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "because I had three younger brothers and sisters myself\n",
      "so they, they thought, okay,\n",
      "she knows how to, how to treat children.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Well, see when, um, I first got my my first baby-sitting job was pretty strange.\n",
      "Um, this lady saw us at church\n",
      "and she was a you know, she was a younger lady.\n",
      "She didn't really know my mom.\n",
      "She knew my mom by name\n",
      "and that was it.\n",
      "And, um, she knew that I was one of the oldest girls in my family\n",
      "so she just asked my mom if I could baby-sit.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "You know, she really didn't know my name or anything, you know,\n",
      "I thought that was pretty strange.\n",
      "You know, and she had two children.\n",
      "One was still in diapers when I started baby-sitting.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "So, um, she pretty much, you know, just assumed that I would know, you know, how to handle them.\n",
      "So, I you know, I enjoy kids\n",
      "and I get along with them very well\n",
      "so there's no problem.\n",
      "But, uh, with today's world and the kids today, uh, there's no way, I can't say that I would just ask someone, you know, that I didn't know like that to baby-sit.\n",
      "Oh, I agree with you,\n",
      "but there again she, you know, she knew, knew of your family,\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "that's true.\n",
      "and she, and she met in a safe setting, such as church.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So she was going on those two instincts.\n",
      "Just the same I know myself,\n",
      "I never,\n",
      "and I was very very protective on who baby-sat my children.\n",
      "Oh, I would be too\n",
      "And, and in it really shocked me\n",
      "because just about six months ago someone came to my front door, rang the doorbell.\n",
      "She had just moved in the neighborhood.\n",
      "She had her daughter with her,\n",
      "and the daughter was, oh, about a second grader.\n",
      "And she was actively looking for people who would baby-sit her child.\n",
      "Oh, my.\n",
      "And I thought, well she doesn't know me or my children from anything.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "And it was, I was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go baby-sit for her because I didn't know her then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, I mean people are so different.\n",
      "Oh, I know.\n",
      "Um, well, I I, obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything.\n",
      "Well, I did, I did have, um, my, my child, uh, in a day care for just a short time when my oldest was about two and a half\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I worked just a part-time job\n",
      "and, uh, in, in those situations, um, what I did is I'd, I went in\n",
      "and, you know, I made a few phone calls,\n",
      "I went in and visited.\n",
      "I asked questions such as how they would discipline a child.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, that was a concern with me.\n",
      "Um, you know, you, you learn a lot by going in there\n",
      "and they they explain to you, you know, what their day consists of and what their general rules are,\n",
      "and, um, that's, you know, that's as much as I know.\n",
      "You probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers you know, that have done this over and over again.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well,\n",
      "But I,\n",
      "go ahead.\n",
      "How did you stumble upon the day-care center?\n",
      "Did you just look it up in a phone book\n",
      "or what was it?\n",
      "Um, I think lots of people, I, I think I went by location for one thing.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I think most people do that.\n",
      "I think you start out with the criteria of, you know, do I know of anything\n",
      "or do I know anyone who has their child in a day care\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "there is , I would say most people would probably go by word of mouth.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And then, you know, I mean, even at that you have to consider the logistics of it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "You know, I mean, you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north. even if that's the best one in the whole wide world\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "exactly.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So there, there are just so many considerations.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Then again, did, um, money come into play with it at all?\n",
      "Oh, money is always a factor in my life, definitely.\n",
      "I've never, you know, I've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor. Um, even in something as important as day care.\n",
      "I know if I didn't have that stipulation, I would have done things differently you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, Montessori school would be something that I would have pursued,\n",
      "but that's always a little bit more expensive than what I could look at.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, and I was very very fortunate in that I didn't have to do that on a full-time basis.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So, and, and then when you get, you know, when you get into the full-time basis day care,\n",
      "Good morning.\n",
      "Hi.\n",
      "My name is Jean.\n",
      "I'm Tina.\n",
      "Oh, where you from Tina?\n",
      "I live in Garland, Texas.\n",
      "Oh, Garland, Texas,\n",
      "I'm in Pennsylvania.\n",
      "Oh, my lands, you're the farthest person I've ever talked to.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Do you work for Texas Instruments?\n",
      "My husband does.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Probably most people you talk to do, huh?\n",
      "Most of them do.\n",
      "Now, I don't have anybody that works for T I,\n",
      "but, uh my son works for a computer company, the National Institute of something,\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "I don't know what\n",
      "I see,\n",
      "well that's neat.\n",
      "So, I guess we're supposed to talk about foods today.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I guess you have to push one, though.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You ready?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Uh, foods like you would for a dinner party or something like that.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I guess so,\n",
      "it may be interesting, because probably here in Texas, we may eat a little differently than you do up there\n",
      "Well, I don't know,\n",
      "my brother lives down East of us down there,\n",
      "and I don't think they ate all that much different\n",
      "Oh, really.\n",
      "Uh, I think as long as you plan your basic foods,\n",
      "course, for a dinner party, you fancy things up a little bit more.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's true.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "Well, uh, the thing that I found interesting,\n",
      "my husband and I lived up in Washington State for awhile\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "and up there, of course they ate a lot of sea food, and that kind of thing,\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "and down here, sea food is pretty expensive, because, you have to ship it a long way to get it\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and it's not as good as if it's fresh.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "and, and, uh, and, but here, we eat a lot of like Mexican foods,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, um, up there there was no, no place that we went tasted like real Mexican food to me.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it tasted like they were trying to do the best they could,\n",
      "but it just, didn't taste right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, they probably were trying to do the best they could.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and, uh, down here, we eat a lot more fried foods, I think.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Like chicken fried steak, is a real big thing.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Up there, uh, it was hardly ever heard of\n",
      "and, we drink ice tea with every meal,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and up there hardly anyone drank ice tea\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well they do in the summertime,\n",
      "I think that tea is big in the summertime mostly.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Of course, you have warmer weather most of the time.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, uh,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it never gets real cold.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, I,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but when, when we have a dinner party around here, I think a lot of the time a Mexican menu is something real popular.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I know that, um, I do a lot of planning with our church,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and a lot of the times when we get together, well everybody will bring a Mexican dish\n",
      "or. And Italian food is real big too.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "More like covered dishes for those type of dinners.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "How about you,\n",
      "what is real popular up there?\n",
      "Well, I don't know,\n",
      "just about anything\n",
      "Oh, really.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we, we really, uh, use most anything.\n",
      "I, uh, I think like parties and that though are,\n",
      "well, like we had a dinner party here, here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "But, basically, we tried, you know, included all the basic, uh, foods that you are supposed to have in a meal .\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Your, uh, bread family and your,\n",
      "or least what it used to be the regular menu was followed and , ham and bake potatoes, uh,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "uh, something from each, each area that you're supposed to choose from.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, we, we, we ourselves are into the wok cooking,\n",
      "you know they been advertising that\n",
      "and, we've really been enjoying those, uh, meals.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, that's good.\n",
      "They have a lot of vegetable to them,\n",
      "and, uh, they really are very good.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "Oh, yes.\n",
      "I, I love that kind of cooking.\n",
      "My, uh, unfortunately, I am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things\n",
      "Is he a meat and potato person?\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "They.\n",
      "Well, all our family is, is gone.\n",
      "They are out on their own.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh. It, it's much different\n",
      "That probably makes it easier,\n",
      "but.\n",
      "and, uh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We find ourselves eating a lot of macaroni and cheese\n",
      "and, uh, and of course ,\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, my husband didn't like that,\n",
      "so we, us kids,\n",
      "we had five children\n",
      "and we ate that when he, he wasn't going to be home for supper,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "that's what we had\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, that's pretty much what we do,\n",
      "if dad's not coming home, we have macaroni and cheese, or something.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, they like, uh, spaghetti.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "You know, that's one meal, I can fix\n",
      "Uh, yeah.\n",
      "and the whole family eats.\n",
      "But, uh, there are several things that,\n",
      "well as a matter of fact, I keep chicken nuggets handy all the time, because.\n",
      "Oh, those always go good.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "the children love them,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and, uh, they are real easy to cook\n",
      "and, that way, whatever meat we have, if they don't like it, well,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and my girls don't like beef,\n",
      "I, don't know,\n",
      "Oh really.\n",
      "Well maybe. that's good the way, way the things are going.\n",
      "I guess,\n",
      "Well, yeah,\n",
      "it could be, they don't,\n",
      "I think it's the texture of it,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but it takes more chewing\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers, and that,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it is easier to chew.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So they're not too much into beef.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "My husband and I eat more beef than we should,\n",
      "but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "We don't really have, uh, you know, entertain too much.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I don't know if you do or not,\n",
      "but we, we don't a whole lot,\n",
      "we're more, once in a while, but mostly family, activities.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, most of the entertaining we do is church associated.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "We have a real tiny little house,\n",
      "we don't have room really, to have people here.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "But, we do get together for fellowships at our church,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, my husband and I do a lot of the planning in that.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And,\n",
      "Well that's good.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it is\n",
      "and it's fun to, uh,\n",
      "I like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we do a lot of that take , things to church\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and our homemakers meet at the church also,\n",
      "and, uh, that's what we do mostly, most of the time for that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, you don't really include any certain food groups,\n",
      "you just bring, what you like\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "That's right\n",
      "Sometimes you have all desserts,\n",
      "sometimes, you have all vegetables\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's true,\n",
      "that's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever, you, uh, like best.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But, it doesn't happen very often,\n",
      "usually you get a pretty wide variety\n",
      "and you can, you can , have pretty good meals, from one of those.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I remember one time we had a progressive dinner.\n",
      "Oh, those are fun.\n",
      "It's the only time that ever.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "they are.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But it's the only time I can remember that,\n",
      "I can't remember what food it was\n",
      "I, it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with.\n",
      "Several people were supposed to bring, you know, each, like, uh, a, an appetizer, and a main dish and a dessert.\n",
      "Uh, uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers\n",
      "and, but when we came to the main, main dish plate, there was only like two or three\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh\n",
      ", Oh.\n",
      "Was there enough to go around?\n",
      "Well, not really,\n",
      "you know we all took real tiny little portions, and, uh, were kind of angry with whoever it was,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "we were not sure who didn't show up with the food\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's kind of irresponsible and does upset you, because they are grown adults usually\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "and you know they know better.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Even if they can't do it, they can always maybe get somebody else to cook .\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Either, either go ahead and fix your dish\n",
      "or call someone that can.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I know it.\n",
      "Well, that sounds neat,\n",
      "I can't, uh, believe you're so far away,\n",
      "but you sound so close.\n",
      "They said that we could share, we share, a recipe\n",
      "It sounds like you're here in Dallas.\n",
      "but, I'm up at my daughter's,\n",
      "I don't even have any of my recipes with me.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Uh, you know ,\n",
      "I don't know if I have anything handy,\n",
      "we were just about, we were getting ready to go swimming,\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "and we're waiting on my sister.\n",
      "Oh, great.\n",
      "Cara, hold on just a second another person in the\n",
      "As a matter of fact, my, little one is hollering\n",
      "They are ready to go.\n",
      "Well, we probably, have we talked long enough\n",
      "I,\n",
      "I think it probably has been.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "so I'll let,\n",
      "So, I've enjoyed talking to you.\n",
      "Oh, same here.\n",
      "You have a good day.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Thanks for calling.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Uh, well, let's see.\n",
      "How many,\n",
      "you said yours are all,\n",
      "I mean, that sounds like an army.\n",
      "Five.\n",
      "Oh, lord.\n",
      "That is an army,\n",
      "I came from a family of six,\n",
      "and I have only got two,\n",
      "and they are, one ...\n",
      "Well any number is nice, let me tell you.\n",
      "Well, I kind of decided that single, single children that, that, that's not parenting,\n",
      "that's a hobby.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But,\n",
      "It's not as fair to the children either, I do not think.\n",
      "Well, do not tell that to all my friends.\n",
      "They are into quality time.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "I am into getting through the day.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too.\n",
      "sounds as if speaker B is washing Well I, I, I can spot a kid who really, you know, whose parents spend every, quality time with them, you know, outside of the work day.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And when I take care of some people's kids, you know,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "when they, when they have teachers' holidays, and that kind of stuff, I will take my friends' kids, that are usually in day care,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and you can spot them, because they have no idea how to hang out and mess around.\n",
      "You can tell.\n",
      "How to just entertain themselves.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Really.\n",
      "It's a problem for any child\n",
      "and you take one that's used to being, uh, busy being, having something to do all the time, it makes a big difference.\n",
      "It's not a problem for my two,\n",
      "they are only eighteen months apart\n",
      "uh, keeps you busy.\n",
      "They can find things to do and mess around, and plot and scheme and everything else.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, that's great.\n",
      "You, did all five of yours complete college?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "our last daughter, she did not want to go to school.\n",
      "She's, uh, but she's married now,\n",
      "they built a home just a couple miles from us.\n",
      "And,\n",
      "Well, how did you go about selecting a college, then?\n",
      "Well, we did not do it right all the time\n",
      "With our first boy, we persuaded him to start here,\n",
      "and I do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home.\n",
      "I think the main thing is to, uh, right now, I think the main thing is to look at what they are interested in. Uh, and take what they are interested in,\n",
      "and then, then start looking for schools.\n",
      "Do you think that what they say that they are interested in is, at eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately ultimately graduating at.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "not necessarily.\n",
      "But, Mike, our oldest boy, I think he would have.\n",
      "He wanted to go to Embrey Riddle\n",
      "and we talked him into going local here first.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh.\n",
      "He went to aeronautical, uh, oh, just learning to work on engines and that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, it has to do with airplanes and everything, which is what his whole life is\n",
      "And I really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally.\n",
      "And he would probably be flying, is what he would be doing.\n",
      "Uh, but, but right now, of course, he's, he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut\n",
      "and they build and rebuild non jet engines.\n",
      "How about the other four, other three who went?\n",
      "Uh, the other ones, uh, the second one, she chose, we let her go where she wanted to, uh,\n",
      "we did not want her to go,\n",
      "but she went to Erie, to Gannan University. Uh, or Gannan College,\n",
      "I am not sure which it is,\n",
      "college, I guess.\n",
      "Uh, she went there two years\n",
      "and it was more expensive\n",
      "and she soon realized, you know,\n",
      "even though she did not like Clarion, she came back and finished at Clarion. Because, it, uh, saved her quite a bit of money\n",
      "and she got really the same basic education that she wanted.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And our other two boys, they went to Clarion also. And, uh, did very well there.\n",
      "And they have all really got, uh, they have all really got really good jobs.\n",
      "And, uh,\n",
      "When they were, like in junior high and high school, I mean, had they, did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, yeah,\n",
      "they kind of had that,\n",
      "they just expected to go.\n",
      "Daphne never went,\n",
      "she always said she would never go to college.\n",
      "She said, I, I always thought she would change her mind, you know,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but she did not.\n",
      "And there's nothing wrong with that, you know, if,\n",
      "college is not for everybody.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "But, uh, it, it does make a difference in your wage income.\n",
      "I think it's what they want out of life,\n",
      "because if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are, they can make a, you know, a much better income.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Like my kids, they are all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state.\n",
      "You know, that boggles,  my mind.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I was,  I was making more than, I was making three times what my father was making, as an executive in the insurance industry, when he retired.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "did you go to college?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "You did.\n",
      "See it makes a difference.\n",
      "I went, uh, four years to undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln, because Lincoln is where, where my parents live.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And there really, there really was not a choice,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I mean the finances, uh, dictated that you had to go there.\n",
      "Uh. Uh-huh.\n",
      "I kind of,\n",
      "I am not going to say I resent it,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but I was, well you know, one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and, you know, one of the Rhodes Scholars kids, and the whole bit, uh,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "my parents did not even discuss with me going to college out of state, or anyplace else,\n",
      "Some place else.\n",
      "and I just knew that the finances, you know, would not support it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "If I had known how, not, I am not going to say easy, but how much less difficult than I thought it would be to get a, uh, scholarship, to go anyplace else, I think that I would definitely, you know, have gone\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Now when I finished there, then I got a scholarship to go the Harvard University in Boston.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And that was, uh, I think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened,\n",
      "I mean I was, taken out of my element, you know, the homogeny midwest, which is a lovely place to grow up, and put into someplace else where, people thought differently, looked differently, sounded differently, you know, different life style.\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Different life styles,\n",
      "yes,\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "And I think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Now my kids, I keep saying that, uh, you know, I would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I do not know, you know, what the realities, you know, is going to look like, you know,\n",
      "we are putting money away already.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, but I really think it's important to put these children someplace where, in addition to, you know, them getting an education, they really need a, you know, a socialization away from what they are raised in. Especially if you lived a pretty insular community\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, An upper class suburb of Dallas, let me tell you, It's very different.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "It's quite a bit different.\n",
      "See that's the way we are,\n",
      "we are more of a rural type of an area\n",
      "and it does make a difference.\n",
      "I, they say, you should not look at the expense of the college when you are looking.\n",
      "You should not.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "not really.\n",
      "Because, they say that a lot of times you get more help, with a more expensive college.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "And so, in the long run, if it's really what they want, you know, they are better off.\n",
      "Now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, we, we did all we could,\n",
      "but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go.\n",
      "They suggested some sort of a recipe, uh, for, uh, company, for entertaining.\n",
      "Did you have anything in mind that, uh, you'd like to share?\n",
      "Well, I, uh, just had a Christmas Around The World party the other night and had some hors d'oeuvres.\n",
      "Ooh.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And I fixed, uh, a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy.\n",
      "Ooh, that sounds good.\n",
      "What,\n",
      "It's, uh, it's like, uh, eight ounces of cream cheese softened,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice, one tablespoon worcester sauce and mix it and spread it out onto a plate.\n",
      "And,\n",
      "One tablespoon of worcester?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then you take and, uh, cover that with drained crab meat mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on Triscuits crackers.\n",
      "Oh, that,\n",
      "And that always goes over real well\n",
      "and it's real easy.\n",
      "How much chili sauce did you say?\n",
      "It's one of the small bottles.\n",
      "Like eight,\n",
      "I don't think, uh,\n",
      "Not eight ounces.\n",
      "That would be a lot.\n",
      "Well, it's about eight ounces.\n",
      "Is it?\n",
      "It, it,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "this would make a lot, right?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it would probably make,\n",
      "well, it doesn't make quite as much as you think,\n",
      "but, yeah,\n",
      "spread it out because you keep the cream cheese kind of thin.\n",
      "And how much crab meat did you use?\n",
      "One tin. Of the flake.\n",
      "One, One can of flake.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And drain it real good.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Have you ever used the, uh, imitation, yet?\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I have.\n",
      "I used it, uh, last Christmastime.\n",
      "Uh, what did I put it in?\n",
      "I think I just served it by itself.\n",
      "There's like a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff.\n",
      "Ooh, that sounds,\n",
      "I've tried it\n",
      "and then I have it here on hand for about a week\n",
      "and then all of a sudden it dawned on me,\n",
      "wait, is this totally imitation\n",
      "and then I found out,\n",
      "I went back to the store\n",
      "and they said it is a fish product.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "So, therefore, you really don't have a very long life, you know once you buy it.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I thought, so, you know, they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is.\n",
      "That's very true.\n",
      "You know.\n",
      "Very true.\n",
      "I had bought a cheesecake, uh,\n",
      "and they very nicely put onto the box that it may be re frozen, which I felt was real nice.\n",
      "Oh, that's a good idea.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Whose was that?\n",
      "It, uh, was, uh, Lawry's, I believe, or Lawler's.\n",
      "And I got it,\n",
      "do you have a Sam's Wholesale Warehouse up there?\n",
      "It's real,\n",
      "Uh, Sam's,\n",
      "right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "okay,\n",
      "that's where I picked it up.\n",
      "It comes out of Chicago\n",
      "and they're very good cheesecakes.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Oh, that sounds good\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "because that's great.\n",
      "That must be the ones that look like they're packaged for a restaurant.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "I, I've,\n",
      "And they have, and they have the little papers between them.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Oh, hey, that sounds,\n",
      "And I think they're, what, about nine dollars and something.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And it's something good to have on hand, too.\n",
      "It's frozen in the first place, right?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So, you can, uh,\n",
      "it is frozen, isn't it?\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "it is frozen.\n",
      "And then you can re freeze.\n",
      "And I thaw it\n",
      "and then you can re freeze it.\n",
      "And,\n",
      "Hey, that sounds great.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That\n",
      "It was, they're very good, very good.\n",
      "And that's the one thing that I hate to make is desserts.\n",
      "Oh, do you?\n",
      "And that's my favorite.\n",
      "Is it?\n",
      "And I really don't care for desserts that well other than one piece of it.\n",
      "Oh, I love to eat it,\n",
      "but I don't like to make it.\n",
      "It takes time\n",
      "and you have to rack your brain,\n",
      "and, time I don't have anymore\n",
      "That's the, that's the thing I hate most about entertaining is thinking of what I'm going to serve.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It is.\n",
      "I, I said I can make it no time.\n",
      "It's trying to think,\n",
      "and then we just, uh, built a new home\n",
      "and I have one of these kitchens that's the center of the house\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and so no matter where they're at, your company can see you cooking. Which is funny.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "And your mess\n",
      "This, well, this is what everyone has said.\n",
      "They said it's okay for you because you keep a real neat kitchen.\n",
      "And I said, yes,\n",
      "I decided it looks better in BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS than it does in practicality.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "But, uh, what I have learned in the, uh, ten months we've lived here, is it that when I entertain, I have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven with all the, everything through, ready to serve. Because with the open area, you don't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess, like you said.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "That's, that's right.\n",
      "So you have to have the picturesque kitchen, you know, right out of the magazine.\n",
      "Well, I like to have mine all done anyway, because then I want to, I want to party, too.\n",
      "I don't want to sit in the kitchen and be putting an olive on something\n",
      "You're right.\n",
      "You know.\n",
      "And you know the funny thing is, now that I have a large kitchen with a big island and that, I still have people trying to come, you know,\n",
      "they'll come in the kitchen\n",
      "and I said, out,\n",
      "we have the chairs on the other side of the counter for guests.\n",
      "Correct\n",
      "You're not allowed to trespass into my kitchen\n",
      "Sounds,\n",
      "And it, it has worked out.\n",
      "But at our point of life we know many of the people we're entertaining uh, well enough that they know, you know, it's very much at home type situation.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Well, a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples, again, that we've known a long time like you, they, uh, we all bring things\n",
      "and it sure makes it a whole lot easier. Anymore.\n",
      "Well, we even have a better one.\n",
      "Now we decided that we all meet, we have it worked,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right,\n",
      "well, I'm not a big exerciser,\n",
      "but I kind of had to start after I had my baby because I wanted to lose that extra weight.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And so basically at this point I'm, I'm a real walker.\n",
      "I am, too.\n",
      "Are you?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I don't do that, oh, I guess I'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips, you know, and keep their arms up.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I don't do that.\n",
      "I mostly just take a, a walk around the block or with my baby\n",
      "or, you know, and I have to do that at least once a day. If it, If it's going to make any effect on, since I have to eat the same as I did before.\n",
      "Oh, that's good.\n",
      "I can't neglect that because of the baby either.\n",
      "And how old is your baby?\n",
      "She just, uh, well, she was premature,\n",
      "so she's about nine months now, though.\n",
      "times goes fast.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Well, I walk two and a half to three miles every night.\n",
      "Oh, that's great.\n",
      "My husband and I were on Nutrisystem about eighteen months ago\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and he lost sixty-two pounds\n",
      "and I lost twenty-one.\n",
      "Oh, my goodness.\n",
      "So we've decided to maintain our weight, that we will do this exercise walking program\n",
      "and we walk our dog every night and go up around the elementary school.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "We have a little path that we do. And, uh, except if it's raining or real cold which it hasn't been\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "we try to get out, uh, every, every night.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And he plays racquetball twice a week,\n",
      "but I'm not into that,\n",
      "so I think the walking is enough to help us stay in shape and toned.\n",
      "Well, I think that is just wonderful.\n",
      "Now, as far as I'm concerned, I have several other children\n",
      "and so, uh, I think at this point to fit it into, to other things, it's kind of a task.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "You know. Uh, it's not to where I'm just so freed up that I, I just go, oh, this is wonderful,\n",
      "let's go\n",
      "Right\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "I know my kids are into sports\n",
      "and a lot of times, tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty\n",
      "so we will just go out after that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, my kids, luckily, are old enough I can leave them at home alone while I go out and walk.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Now, does your husband usually go with you, then?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Oh, see, now that's really nice.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Because mine's at meetings sometimes\n",
      "and, and he's not really into it\n",
      "so I have to,\n",
      "No\n",
      "my husband never was either until he lost the weight.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That was his decision.\n",
      "He had arthritis in his hips\n",
      "and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise.\n",
      "I think that is so wonderful.\n",
      "So once he got motivated, now he's ready to walk every night.\n",
      "And our dog has lost a little weight.\n",
      "He walks every night, too\n",
      "So, he gets excited when he sees us put on our, our shoes, our walking shoes.\n",
      "I bet.\n",
      "I think that's really, really good.\n",
      "And, and, you know, I think this, after you've done it a certain amount of time, it kind of does get to be a routine.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "It's not,\n",
      "like when I first started, it, you know, that was the hardest thing was to get ready and get out there.\n",
      "Making time for it.\n",
      "But now if I haven't done it in a day or two or something, I really notice that I haven't done it in a ...\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "You know. And I like the time because my kids, sometimes they come with me\n",
      "and sometimes they don't.\n",
      "And when they don't, I, I really notice, you know, how fun it can be when they come.\n",
      "So, uh, I like to have somebody come with me.\n",
      "I know,\n",
      "I do, too.\n",
      "Uh, I know most of, enough of the people that if anything ever happened I could go to a home around this block area.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So it, it's not real dangerous,\n",
      "but still, I don't like to go alone.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "So\n",
      "I never do either. Even if I have my dog with me.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You know, it's nice to have another person there,\n",
      "but ...\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You know,\n",
      "Mostly, it's my husband\n",
      "and sometimes it's my kids.\n",
      "Well, I think that's great.\n",
      "I, and, well, sometimes when I, I take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise I, I really think I do.\n",
      "I was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, I found real quick that wasn't for me.\n",
      "Me, too.\n",
      "I did the dance step when I lived up in Michigan\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "and it just wore me out.\n",
      "I would leave totally exhausted.\n",
      "I never lost any weight,\n",
      "and I got to the point I dreaded going in.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "So walking seems to be a good solution for me\n",
      "and it doesn't cost anything\n",
      "Right\n",
      "right.\n",
      "And it gives me time to think.\n",
      "So I think, not only does it help my body,\n",
      "but I think it helps my mind too.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So I like that.\n",
      "That's the one time in the day my husband and I can get away and talk without having the kids jump in and ...\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "need something\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "They can wait until you get back home.\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "Well, I think that's great\n",
      "Well, that's what I do for\n",
      "Yep,\n",
      "that's all I do, too.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "how's the weather been in Plano?\n",
      "Basically about the same as what you've probably had.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, I don't know about you,\n",
      "but I was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks,\n",
      "and I'm ready for it to come back.\n",
      "Oh, you like the rain, do you?\n",
      "Well, not the rain so much as the cool, the other mornings when it was like sixty-five when we woke up and sixty-six,\n",
      "and today I know when I got up that the temperature said more like, close, seventy-nine or eighty\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so I'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather.\n",
      "Oh, are you?\n",
      "I don't care for that as much.\n",
      "You don't\n",
      "No.\n",
      "are you a summer person?\n",
      "I'm a summer person\n",
      "Are you?\n",
      "I like the heat.\n",
      "Well, I have a friend who's the same way,\n",
      "and anything below sixty, she's just not happy\n",
      "but I, I think what I would miss is the change of seasons and all because I know in Plano we really don't have as many seasons as, uh,\n",
      "my husband's from Nebraska,\n",
      "and they have more of the four seasons.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and I'm from Utah,\n",
      "so, I, I like, the four seasons\n",
      "Oh, you're used to that, too.\n",
      "I just don't like the cold.\n",
      "You don't like the cold.\n",
      "Well, I usually like it about sweater weather,\n",
      "and the problem here in Plano is it doesn't last very long.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It goes from hot,\n",
      "and then you get a couple of weeks of that Indian Summer,\n",
      "and then it's cold\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and I wish it were several months of that.\n",
      "The thing, the other thing is the, I don't like the rain either.\n",
      "Well, I don't either unless it's like, uh,\n",
      "some of my favorite's like a Friday night when it rains\n",
      "and you really didn't have anywhere to go,\n",
      "and it's sleeping time.\n",
      "But if you have to get up and get out in it, I don't like it either\n",
      "Well, we have several children that are in sports,\n",
      "and so it always makes their games be postponed forever and ever and ever on, on, and on.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Well, sure it does.\n",
      "That kind of schedule, you really need a lot more sunshine.\n",
      "I like it better, I think.\n",
      "And also the evenings are going to be getting, uh, darker sooner as it gets cooler.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But I did a walk last night,\n",
      "and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still.\n",
      "Sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler.\n",
      "The thing about when it gets hot here is, I don't like the humidity,\n",
      "that part I don't care about.\n",
      "Well, I agree, absolutely,\n",
      "and you know, it's all relative,\n",
      "because I was from West Texas,\n",
      "and it was very dry,\n",
      "and so I thought Dallas was awful,\n",
      "and I still think so,\n",
      "but then this summer we went to Orlando for a week,\n",
      "and it was so humid there that your, um, all your windows were were wet every morning.\n",
      "They had to get the squeejies and clean them off.\n",
      "Oh, really.\n",
      "And when we got back to Dallas it seemed really dry because it's kind of like what you're used to.\n",
      "But I agree with you,\n",
      "the humidity, especially for curly heads like me.\n",
      "Oh, is that right?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I do not like the\n",
      "Well another reason,\n",
      "well, I guess I can't say that it, I don't like the rain completely.\n",
      "We have a little garden that we have\n",
      "and and so it really helps our garden,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, you know, even, I don't know if that's because plants are just that way\n",
      "and they like rain,\n",
      "or, it seems they thrive when it rains,\n",
      "they just, really,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I think so too.\n",
      "I know our grass needs mowing twice as often when it rains\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but it seems like here,\n",
      "I would like it to rain and then be over, and then not rain for a while.\n",
      "It seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern, that's all it does.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "So, uh, but I, I am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties but something like,\n",
      "Well,\n",
      "I guess my, my best would be probably sixty-eight when you wake up or sixty-six, and then probably seventy-five during the day.\n",
      "Well I like seventies I like seventies okay.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "are you, do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds.\n",
      "Oh, I don't like nineties.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "You can give me seventies\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and you can give me eighties\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "keep it there\n",
      "and I'm okay.\n",
      "But when it gets too hot, then it's, that, I don't like that\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I stay in the house because it's just, It's just too hot.\n",
      "Well, I do, too,\n",
      "I do, too\n",
      "and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it.\n",
      "But then we started thinking, especially in Plano, the weather is so hot in August, that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Static here.\n",
      "That's okay\n",
      "Um, I've, I've thought about that, too,\n",
      "and, um, when we take our vacations, we, we do take them in August sometimes so that we can be away from here\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We do too.\n",
      "I think a lot of people agree the same.\n",
      "It just really gets way,\n",
      "when it gets way too hot\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "and we've been here for several years,\n",
      "and we've been here years when it's been hundreds\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "now there have been worse summers.\n",
      "In fact this morning when they were talking about, uh, Harold Taft, they were talking about how this has been one of the milder of the summers and milder fall,\n",
      "Years,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "everybody seems to be,\n",
      "you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat, because they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're melting,\n",
      "and you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings when we're, it'll be too cold,\n",
      "and they'll say,\n",
      "well those are the ones that like the cold weather.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "He, he always did such a good job, I thought.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "he did,\n",
      "he did.\n",
      "It was it was really a shame.\n",
      "A good weather man,\n",
      "He didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them did.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Anyway, um, I guess it's,\n",
      "It's kind of hard to keep on about the weather for five minutes\n",
      "That's okay,\n",
      "they say when you're done you're done,\n",
      "Oh, is that right?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "you don't have to wait for them to say cut off your time.\n",
      "Oh, good.\n",
      "You just say, Have a good day or whatever.\n",
      "Well good,\n",
      "well, then have a good day.\n",
      "You too.\n",
      "And I hope you enjoy the weather this week.\n",
      "You too.\n",
      "What is it about, nursing homes?\n",
      "well, about nursing homes, and, and older people.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they're just really close here.\n",
      "And his mother has bad health too\n",
      "and so I go over sometimes in the day when he's at work\n",
      "and I, um, help with her and bathe her and feed her.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And, uh, and I, that's hard to be a caretaker I really believe.\n",
      "It's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty-four hours a day.\n",
      "Oh, it's very difficult\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Uh, she has Alzheimer's and does not remember, uh, a lot if anything.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And so she asks the same questions over and over again. Which is not you know, unrealistic.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Um, and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, I, uh,\n",
      "some nights his mother calls me and says can your family,\n",
      "and just bring the kids in the family\n",
      "and just come over and, and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "how old is she?\n",
      "She's ninety-two.\n",
      "Uh, my, see my father is ninety-two\n",
      "and still, uh, he and mother still live at the house and drive and and do the whole thing,\n",
      "Oh, I think that's wonderful.\n",
      "but you know if something would, uh, whenever something happens to one of them then, I don't know what I'll do up there.\n",
      "Well,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I, I just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes\n",
      "and so,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I was just going to say.\n",
      "They're in Missouri\n",
      "and I could, I, I know, I know stories for sure that they just, they, they just, well, they can't take the proper care of them. Most of them.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Um,\n",
      "And, uh, it's, it's tragic that, you know, when people live so long that they, uh, don't have a really don't have a place to go.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "Uh, I think it's wonderful these, these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily\n",
      "but they can go and reside there like little apartments, places in between places.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And I like that idea if they can handle it themselves.\n",
      "Um,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "there's one very close to where my parents are\n",
      "but, uh, I think it would be nice\n",
      "but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "So, uh, I mean, he's from that old depression era\n",
      "and, uh, you know, it's, oh, it's just blissfull that they're both, able to do everything for themselves.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I would imagine that I'll, uh, if something happens, I'll move one of them or you know, in, in with me.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, uh,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But I know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is\n",
      "and, but I think you'd have to really,\n",
      "they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the, uh on this homes.\n",
      "Nursing homes.\n",
      "But I just don't know how much you can see when you go for a,\n",
      "Visit.\n",
      "I think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And so many people when they put people in the nurses home, they never see them.\n",
      "They don't go and see them.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "They never go to see them.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "I've talked to many, uh, owners of places and say that nobody even,\n",
      "maybe, maybe Christmas.\n",
      "You know, um, I, I think nursing homes are, are, um, some are good\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I have to say that.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "But for the most part I truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children.\n",
      "Oh, I do too.\n",
      "Um,\n",
      "Or if, if they could be real, real nearby where they could see them everyday or so.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "Uh, because I know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes, uh, regulation in Texas\n",
      "so maybe we'll get it improved.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "I hope so.\n",
      "Anyway.\n",
      "You know, it's, I think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice to have them go there.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Oh, it's tough I'm sure.\n",
      "And then if you find out that they are not having good care, you know, I'm sure that it is just, you know, you'd pull them out of there so fast.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "that would be devastating I'm sure\n",
      "so.\n",
      "And, uh, and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker I don't, uh,\n",
      "it's a very, very hard decision I think.\n",
      "It is a tough decision\n",
      "and it's one that needs a great deal of thought, and prior probably.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I think that's right,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Now I know a friend of mine who had a father, uh, she brought to her home, uh, to live there,\n",
      "but he needed the medical treatment\n",
      "and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to, to help him out.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And that might be a partial solution, or something.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "But, um, I personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before I think I'd ever,\n",
      "I would hope we could do that, and then go from there.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, anyway,\n",
      "Well, I, I think we kind of are along the same lines.\n",
      "We've covered a little bit\n",
      "and, uh, it's good to hear from you\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Good to hear from you.\n",
      "Have a good,\n",
      "Have a lovely day.\n",
      "Have a good\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Have you faced, uh, elderly care yet, uh, nursing home care for any of your parents?\n",
      "Unfortunately, yes.\n",
      "Uh, in fact, tonight I had the dinner with, uh, my three brothers and our wives\n",
      "and we were talking, uh,\n",
      "we had a review with the nursing home staff.\n",
      "My mother's in a nursing home.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, we had a review today\n",
      "and a few things we had to do that are part of it that you don't really like, like, uh making decisions on living wills and extended care, that type of thing,\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "so, yes,\n",
      "I'm very familiar with it\n",
      "and it's not something that is, uh, you know,\n",
      "I never thought I'd have to go through this kind of experience.\n",
      "But I guess we all do.\n",
      "I think sooner or later, uh,\n",
      "both my mother and my husband's mother, we had to end up putting in nursing homes\n",
      "and they were to the point that they only lived, both of them, about six weeks once they got in.\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "And, uh-huh.\n",
      "And it's absolutely, I believe that was one of the hardest things I ever did. In my life.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I, that, it just, you know, it's absolutely devastating.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "What have you found in dealing with the nursing homes?\n",
      "Well, they're not, every, all the horror stories you hear about them I think are true.\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Uh, we've, you know, we've looked around\n",
      "and, my wife has looked at, extensively at all the ones in the area\n",
      "And the one she is in now, uh, there's a lot of drawbacks, a lot of things we don't like.\n",
      "But, again, it's no different than every one.\n",
      "And, you know, the cost of it, the, three thousand dollars a month\n",
      "Um, uh-huh.\n",
      "when you think about it, for what you're paying a hospital for almost the same, well, even not as much care.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "It's not that expensive, really.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "uh, there, well, there's a little bit of difference in, in the two between my mother and my mother-in-law.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, theirs both ran,\n",
      "oh, I think my mother-in-law's was like fifteen hundred\n",
      "and my mother's was two thousand.\n",
      "Then, this has been five years ago.\n",
      "And, uh uh, one of the things that, you know, I had discovered is that if they knew that I came in there at all different hours, they got much better care than if,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "when I started out with my mother-in-law, because she was in there first, I would go certain hours\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they knew.\n",
      "And if I'd pop in unexpectedly, I discovered, you know, they did a little bit, they did better.\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "You know, uh-huh.\n",
      "And, you know, a couple of times with my mother-in-law, I would catch something not being taken care of. And, you know, would have to rate,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so I got to where, I knew then when my mother was in that, you know, not to go the same time all the time. Because they would,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and when I was looking for the nursing homes, another thing that I learned, uh,\n",
      "we had my mother all set to go into one\n",
      "and for some reason I just went back, and on my own went around the different floors.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, I saw areas that they had not shown me\n",
      "and they did not come across as well as, you know, what they had originally shown me,\n",
      "Well, I'll be darned.\n",
      "so, uh, we did not put her in that one.\n",
      "We put her in another one that I, I went a couple of times when they weren't expecting me and saw, and, you know, was much, uh, better pleased with the situation.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "you, you know, this is the whole point.\n",
      "You've got, you've got to shop them.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "you do.\n",
      "I know my mother's in now, in a unit that's mainly Alzheimer's\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, we're convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, the fact that these people are they're up and around,\n",
      "but they're, they're, it's reminds me too much of an asylum type situation.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And it's very, very,\n",
      "Does your mother have Alzheimer's?\n",
      "She,\n",
      "well, who knows.\n",
      "They call it, uh, dementia.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, we don't know.\n",
      "I, I mean she does not know us anymore\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and whether it's Alzheimer's or what it is nobody really knows,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but it's, basically the same.\n",
      "And her health is not that bad.\n",
      "Although she has gone down, downhill drastically since this, this last,\n",
      "well, she had been in a retirement community\n",
      "and somewhere in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children.\n",
      "Well she, we, we just did not have the capabilities to, to take care of her.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, but she, she has gone down steadily since she has been in,\n",
      "and she's been in the nursing home now for, oh, I would say about three months.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And,\n",
      "Did she know that she was going to a nursing home?\n",
      "I'm sorry?\n",
      "Did she know that she was going to a nursing home?\n",
      "She,\n",
      "no,\n",
      "as far as she knew, she was going to a hospital. And that she could, she could handle a hospital\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and we says, you know, mom, if you, you know, if you get a, you get better, you've got to have the care, the doctor insisted on it, you know, if you get better that you could come out.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "what kind of car are you going to buy next?\n",
      "Well, one of the cars I'm thinking about buying next is, uh, a nice, safe, small car,\n",
      "but, um, uh, the reason being, is we just purchased a van a little while ago because we have a big family,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and we use that to get back and forth and haul kids around and so forth,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and we have another four door car that I drive to work,\n",
      "and I think it'd be more economical if I were able to a smaller car and, uh, wouldn't be, wouldn't cost much with gas.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That's true,\n",
      "that's true.\n",
      "What, what are you looking at?\n",
      "Well, I'm really not looking at anything for a while,\n",
      "but you know, when you're driving down the road you see all these pretty new ones that are out,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and you think, Oh, well, maybe, maybe I would like a new car.\n",
      "Oh, yeah\n",
      "But I think I'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway.\n",
      "Oh, yes,\n",
      "oh, yes.\n",
      "But, uh.\n",
      "Well, the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "they are.\n",
      "I sure do like the looks of that new Mitsubishi Diamante.\n",
      "Oh, yes,\n",
      "oh, yes.\n",
      "That is a pretty car.\n",
      "I'm, uh, I really like the looks also of the new Mazda that they have,\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "that's pretty, too.\n",
      "but um, I, uh, you know, the, the costs of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they get pretty expensive.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "they do.\n",
      "The last one I bought, I bought a, uh,\n",
      "well, it's a, it's a Town Car,\n",
      "but it was a demo, returned\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I got it with like, you know, I think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it and nearly ten thousand dollars less than what the list price was.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Well, you can't go wrong with that kind of opportunity.\n",
      "So I was really pleased to find that,\n",
      "and I then, I bought it for cheaper,\n",
      "I was looking at a Honda Accord, a brand new one\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "and I bought this, uh, the, the Lincoln Town Car for just a little less money than what I was going to buy the new Honda Accord.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Well, you get a much bigger, better comfortable ride.\n",
      "And the thing about it is they give you that ten, uh, that hundred thousand mile, five year warranty where it only costs you twenty-five dollars to have anything repaired.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Well, that's fantastic.\n",
      "That's real, real good.\n",
      "So, uh, I have really been impressed.\n",
      "I said, I probably never be able, to find another one that I can afford, you know.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "do you,\n",
      "But I have loved this car better than anything I've ever driven, because you can go on the road and get there\n",
      "and you're not even tired.\n",
      "Very comfortable, smooth ride, huh.\n",
      "And it gets like twenty-six miles to the gallon on the road.\n",
      "Oh, it does?\n",
      "It sure does.\n",
      "That's, that's unbelievable for that size of car.\n",
      "I, they kept telling me that,\n",
      "and I thought they're crazy,\n",
      "so the week after I got it, well, actually before I signed the papers on it, I took it over to Boozier City\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "and it did it.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "But it's, uh,\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "That kind of gas mileage, uh, we're, we're kind of hoping for on our van.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, that's kind of what we've always been told, you know, they'll do,\n",
      "and then we hope for it,\n",
      "and it never happens\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but it really, it does get good gas mileage.\n",
      "Well, that's excellent.\n",
      "Most of the time when I don't go anywhere I can drive it for like three weeks from to and from work, you know, and then fill it up,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Do you, uh, do, does it, uh, need a lot of repairs?\n",
      "Is it a very reliable kind of car?\n",
      "I haven't had anything,\n",
      "I've taken it in twice for like just really minor things,\n",
      "and it cost me the twenty-five dollars.\n",
      "The, uh, really something really silly when we first got it,\n",
      "we couldn't get the light,\n",
      "they have all these lights in the car\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the back seat\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "and we couldn't get the light to turn off.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "And we kept trying, you know,\n",
      "and we went out to dinner with some friends,\n",
      "and it stayed on all night, you know just shining right down on them, you know\n",
      "Oh dear.\n",
      "Oh dear\n",
      "and we couldn't get it to turn off,\n",
      "and the next day my husband goes out there\n",
      "and he tries to get it off,\n",
      "we turn the knob, you know, in the front that's supposed to turn the lights on and off\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and we turned everything we could,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and he took it in,\n",
      "and they said, you know, you just have to press the switch.\n",
      "He says, I've pressed every switch in that car,\n",
      "and I can't get the light off,\n",
      "it's broken.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So they took it in and charged us the twenty-five dollars,\n",
      "and they called and told us though, that all you have to do is turn the off switch,\n",
      "and they showed us where the switch was.\n",
      "They charged you twenty-five dollars just to tell you that, huh.\n",
      "They, they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "oh, so they probably went through the,\n",
      "But he hadn't, he hadn't done the right one.\n",
      "I see\n",
      "And it's right on the arm rest in the back\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and we didn't know it was there.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "And the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car\n",
      "And found it right away.\n",
      "and so we thought, you know, there, there was, it was broken.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But we've had just, uh,\n",
      "I guess it's been in two times.\n",
      "I've had it three years now.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "And, uh, it's been in two, maybe three times.\n",
      "But it's just been real minor things.\n",
      "Well, I think that, uh, you have an excellent deal then,\n",
      "and the, the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it's so well built that they don't expect any kind of major repairs whereas with an awful lot of other lower quality cars you would be getting repairs after repair after repair\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and those companies wouldn't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "But it's really, it's been an enjoyable car.\n",
      "Like I say, I'll probably never be able to have another one, because I think we bought it for about sixteen thousand, you know\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "and I said, I'll never find another one for that price.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "not at all.\n",
      "And they keep going up,\n",
      "so I'll have to enjoy it,\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "we're on, uh, recycling\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "and, uh, I am not real well informed on exactly what Richardson does.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I know that we, uh, they ask us to bundle our newspapers,\n",
      "and we do that,\n",
      "and we recycle our aluminum pop cans and stuff.\n",
      "I see.\n",
      "But now Plano has quite an elaborate system, don't they?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they do.\n",
      "Uh, it started out several years ago when they put these, uh, collection sites they, uh, near a WalMart, near a football stadium and the like,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they just couldn't believe how many people were going out of their way to fill these things up.\n",
      "These huge dumpsters were being filled up in a, in a matter of a week.\n",
      "So they knew that there was something going on here.\n",
      "So, they started looking into programs,\n",
      "and what we have now,\n",
      "it, they changed the whole way that they do garbage in Plano.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Instead of collecting plastic bags of garbage two days a week, they make a collection on Monday for yard waste,\n",
      "and the yard waste has to be put in a special bag that's a decomposable paper sack\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "it's a pretty good size.\n",
      "It's maybe the size of two or three, um, grocery bags.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And we put that out by the street,\n",
      "and they collect those on Monday.\n",
      "And then on Wednesday, we put out two containers that they gave us.\n",
      "One container's a huge, green, monstrous thing that a, uh, uh, a special truck comes by and hooks onto the side of it and flips the container into the back of the garbage truck.\n",
      "So and that's where you put your regular, um, garbage and trash.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "And then also, that same day, you put out a small tub,\n",
      "it's maybe two feet high and three feet by two feet wide,\n",
      "and you put, just throw in your aluminum and your milk jugs and newspaper,\n",
      "and then the.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "and then they they separate it.\n",
      "Exactly,\n",
      "they have a big truck that has like not ten, maybe five big doors on the side of it,\n",
      "and they throw the different stuff in the different doors.\n",
      "Oh, that's a neat system.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "it is.\n",
      "And apparently it's, you know, it, it went off pretty much without a hitch.\n",
      "The trucks, the special five door trucks were a little tough in getting because of something to do with the Persian Gulf war\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "that the trucks were being, the engines or something were being shipped over there for something or other.\n",
      "But it does work pretty well.\n",
      "Well, I know our son and daughter-in-law live in Plano,\n",
      "and I know they have commented on the system.\n",
      "I don't know that they know that it worked that way,\n",
      "but they have the two separate containers and stuff.\n",
      "Oh, yes,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "I noticed something interesting last time, I guess two Wednesdays ago when they were picking up,\n",
      "I happened to be out there in the morning when they were picking up the, that tub stuff,\n",
      "and the man who was doing the separating, when he was done emptying the tub, he took a little electronic reader device off of his belt\n",
      "and he read the bar code that was on the side of the tub.\n",
      "So they must be collecting information about who does it, and how often.\n",
      "Oh, that is interesting.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Because I wonder if that means that if you don't do it\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "do you suppose they will come and knock on your door and,\n",
      "I, I don't know,\n",
      "but I think that's a really interesting question.\n",
      "That, that is interesting.\n",
      "You know, will you be penalized if you don't.\n",
      "Will you, uh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that, that seems farfetched only because it, it, there's no law that says you have to buy a newspaper or pop cans or milk jugs.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "So there, there's, it's possible that there is a person in Plano that doesn't buy any of those three things, and therefore wouldn't have.\n",
      "That's true, except that it's hard to imagine, you know, when you have, uh, cans, you know, from the, the market and, uh you know, vegetable cans, and et cetera.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "they won't take vegetable cans.\n",
      "Oh, they don't take vegetable cans.\n",
      "Just, just the aluminum pop cans.\n",
      "This is just their aluminum cans.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, then yes,\n",
      "so they have,\n",
      "that's interesting.\n",
      "I wonder, uh, uh,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "what they're doing with that.\n",
      "Wouldn't you really like to know?\n",
      "I would.\n",
      "Someday I'm sure we'll find out.\n",
      "I'm sure\n",
      "you know, if nothing else call the sanitation department say, okay,\n",
      "what are you doing reading you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So tell me your feelings on recycling.\n",
      "Is it, do you think this is a good thing, or silly.\n",
      "I think it's a very good thing.\n",
      "I think that, uh, I think it helps if the city is giving you a nudge to do it because I think there are a lot of people that don't do it,\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "and I can't say that my husband and I are real, real conscientious.\n",
      "We got started on the aluminum cans because our, uh, grandson was collecting them, uh, to raise money and stuff for an organization he was in.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "So we started collecting them,\n",
      "and now he's through,\n",
      "so we've just, we've kept on\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and it's interesting, too, that we have to drive, we drive to Plano at Plano Road to, uh, just inside your city limits, to, you know turn them in to dump them in.\n",
      "Dump them off.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and that is interesting.\n",
      "I'm sure there's bound to be some here in Richardson\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "but we just haven't really seen them advertised or you know, something.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, the\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "the Plano newspaper each, each day, in fact, has a, a little list of all the recycling centers for all the different things.\n",
      "They publish it every single day.\n",
      "Well, that's interesting.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and phone numbers, and, and that kind of stuff.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "well, I haven't noticed, uh, I haven't noticed Richardson, you know, making that big a,\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "on a scale of one to ten where do you stand and why?\n",
      "Well, I guess I stand on, uh, on, probably ten for no, uh, restrictions.\n",
      "I, uh, recently just moved to Texas from, uh, South Dakota and Nebraska,\n",
      "and I guess in terms of gun control I've always, uh, been raised with the, uh, idea in the Constitution that, uh, citizens had a right to bear arms,\n",
      "and I realize that probably way back when when the Constitution was written it probably regarded, uh, more, uh, of a national defense, uh, than anything else,\n",
      "but, uh, on the other hand, too, uh, people then, uh, needed to use firearms for, um, survival in terms of, uh, food\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "true.\n",
      "and, uh, I was raised, uh, you know, hunting all the time,\n",
      "I lived on the farm, and, uh, you know, enjoy hunting\n",
      "and I guess I have, uh, some problems with, uh, being restricted to, um, owning a gun for, you know, hunting purposes mainly.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And, um, it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where, um, eventually we may not be able to have that right any more.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I can, I can understand that.\n",
      "I was raised in Oklahoma,\n",
      "and of course, being Oklahoman and Texan, uh,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "the hunting and everything,\n",
      "and I used to things in my father and my husband having guns and all,\n",
      "and I, I did, used to be all in favor of it,\n",
      "but it's, all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs.\n",
      "Yet I think I would vote a one if I thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun, no crooks, nothing.\n",
      "But because I know that's not going to happen, then I have to probably right up there about an eight\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it, uh, moving to this area, of course it happens everywhere,\n",
      "but, uh, I guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns, uh, in the midwest and then, uh, moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings\n",
      "and, uh, there seems like killing for no reason at all,\n",
      "and, uh.\n",
      "Well, it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was.\n",
      "There's always been a certain amount of crime in your, you know, your urban areas,\n",
      "and I know we lived in Chicago for seven years,\n",
      "and of course it was definitely there.\n",
      "So when we first moved here, it wasn't as bad as this.\n",
      "It's, you know, it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse.\n",
      "I don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the, uh, drug kings that are here and Jamaican drug kings coming in.\n",
      "I don't know whether that's it, or street gangs.\n",
      "I don't know what the answer is.\n",
      "I know that it's scary,\n",
      "and yet I hate the government constantly telling me what I can do and what I can't do,\n",
      "and that's basically what the gun control would end up being.\n",
      "I, I think so,\n",
      "and, and there's always the, uh, the, uh, the old, uh, saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll, they'll get one,\n",
      "and, uh, and then, uh.\n",
      "Well, it's very true.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's not the law abiding citizen that, you know, is, is dangerous with the gun\n",
      "It's the ones that are going out and stealing it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And I said I think the only way I would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them.\n",
      "And I think that would almost have to go with armies, too.\n",
      "I mean, they'd have to be almost world-wide, which we know would never ever happen.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "that's for sure.\n",
      "Because even if you said, okay,\n",
      "you know, armed forces could have them,\n",
      "some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and, uh, and, you know, uh, I suppose, uh, years ago, way back when, uh, when, uh, they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they, uh, were fed up with the government, uh,\n",
      "and if they didn't have a way to, uh, to fight back they would have been in big trouble.\n",
      "That's very true\n",
      "very true.\n",
      "Who knows,\n",
      "we maybe want to overthrow the government\n",
      "Well, the way things are going.\n",
      "I know,\n",
      "if somebody doesn't do something.\n",
      "Uh, what about, uh, what do you think of this, this, uh, law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait X number of days before you can, uh, carry the gun, or buy, you know, actually purchase the gun?\n",
      "Well, you know, they introduced some gun control back when I was a teenager, I believe, in terms of, uh, every gun you bought had to be licensed, I believe.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "And, uh, you know, that didn't bother me, uh, too much,\n",
      "and so, I guess it depends, um, if there are some statistics that show that, uh, that people, uh, commit crimes on the spur of the moment.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "uh, I guess our topic is about movies\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, what is coincidence,\n",
      "we got a baby-sitter\n",
      "and we went to the movies that past weekend.\n",
      "Oh, so did I\n",
      "And we saw CAPE FEAR.\n",
      "Oh, I heard that was excellent.\n",
      "It is.\n",
      "Is it?\n",
      "It's really good.\n",
      "Uh, I wanted to see that\n",
      "I was deciding between that and, uh, MY GIRL\n",
      "and, uh, my boyfriend and I went to see MY GIRL.\n",
      "Oh, how was that?\n",
      "Oh, it was excellent.\n",
      "It was a really, really good movie.\n",
      "I'd recommend it.\n",
      "I heard that's, a movie that, uh, you really can't take children.\n",
      "Is that true?\n",
      "Uh, I heard the opposite that, uh, you should take children to see it.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Uh, there were quite a few, uh, kids in there with their parents.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, I don't know, though,\n",
      "I, I've heard that, and then what you just told me\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "because, uh, the little boy dies.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It was sad.\n",
      "It was really sad.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "But, uh, his, it kind of shows how his, uh, best friend, this little girl, deals with his death and how, I think, maybe, how children should deal with death.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Maybe.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, it was really good.\n",
      "It was sad, very sad.\n",
      "Oh, I want to see that one.\n",
      "Well, CAPE FEAR was, was more suspenseful.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It was really suspenseful.\n",
      "So that, that's, that's a real good movie to see.\n",
      "I heard it was, uh, sort of like, uh, not, uh, too violent,\n",
      "but it was kind of like, uh, gross, kind of like, uh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, like.\n",
      "Uh, no,\n",
      "and it, uh, it was kind of,\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "it's kind of both, I guess,\n",
      "but it's not, it's not as bad as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "But, uh, it's just as suspenseful, I think.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And it, it was a real good movie.\n",
      "And then we saw BEAUTY AND THE BEAST Because we have two kids. And FIEVEL GOES WEST\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "Oh, I've seen, uh, previews for them on T V,\n",
      "but I,\n",
      "But, uh, those were, those were okay,\n",
      "so, And then, oh, boy, it's been, it's been so long since we've been to the movies,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but I, we've rented some videos.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "I like to rent movies, too.\n",
      "And I think the last one I rented was, uh, MORTAL THOUGHTS with Demi Moore.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Oh, I, I didn't see that.\n",
      "And, uh, that, that, that's okay.\n",
      "That's pretty good.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh, and, uh, WHAT ABOUT BOB?\n",
      "I have seen that at the theatres,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we rented that one.\n",
      "That, that was cute.\n",
      "And, uh, uh, I guess that's about it.\n",
      "Have you rented any movies lately?\n",
      "Uh, the last movie I rented was THE HARD WAY with Michael J. Fox\n",
      "and, uh,\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "that was good.\n",
      "We rented that one, too.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I liked that.\n",
      "I like Michael J. Fox a lot.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "He's one of my favorites.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I like his movies.\n",
      "So, do you go to the movies often,\n",
      "or,\n",
      "No,\n",
      "not too often.\n",
      "I, I hadn't been to the movies for a really long time since last weekend.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, uh, there's been movies out that I've been wanting to see.\n",
      "I just, you know, don't get a chance to get out and see them.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "well, we have two little kids,\n",
      "so it's hard for us to get out and go to the movies.\n",
      "We have to dig up a baby-sitter\n",
      "and And that's only the only time we can go out,\n",
      "Oh I see.\n",
      "so our time is scarce.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "But, uh, we, we, we we, you know, we're, we're big movie people\n",
      "and we try and do\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and I don't, I don't know about the last movie I've seen on T V that was real good. Uh,\n",
      "Really.\n",
      "It just seems so sad to have to only rely on, you know, college football.\n",
      "Is that all they're going to have to make money, you know.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But I didn't think that was the objective, to make money.\n",
      "But it seems like it is.\n",
      "Huh. It really is.\n",
      "I know there's a lot of pressure on schools to have a winning program. To get the best athletes so they can keep their seats full.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "You went to Indiana University?\n",
      "Uh, Purdue.\n",
      "Oh Purdue,\n",
      "okay.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, good.\n",
      "So.\n",
      "You're, you're a T I up in Sherman?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, very good.\n",
      "Are you from Dallas area?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I'm in the facilities there, down here in Dallas.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I guess football is the big sport down here, isn't it.\n",
      "Uh, certainly high school football, and college football,\n",
      "but again high school football is just so much fun to watch,\n",
      "because, uh, you know, not everybody plays of course, but they're still,\n",
      "it's good\n",
      "and it's still,\n",
      "you know the kids,\n",
      "and there's absolutely no money involved whatsoever,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and you know they're going to class, you know.\n",
      "You heard of, Have you heard of Damon Bailey. The I U white guard that plays.\n",
      "It, it's, it's real amateur sports.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Well, last year, when he was in high school, they drew a crowd of like forty-one thousand for the state finals, when he played.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "I never heard ,\n",
      "that's, uh,\n",
      "I never been in a football game in high school that had that many.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "so that's, I mean, that's pretty big.\n",
      "Like he's from Indiana,\n",
      "and he plays for Indiana now.\n",
      "And, Indiana him to be a lot bigger than pro basketball up there.\n",
      "The Pacers don't really draw that big of a crowd\n",
      "You know, the high school games, I mean, that seems to be the big attraction, and college.\n",
      "Well, my office mate here, Earl, he, he goes to all the Maverick games\n",
      "and he loves that.\n",
      "He, he would be,\n",
      "this is a great question for him, uh, to talk about\n",
      "Like he's got,\n",
      "I'm looking at his calendar,\n",
      "he's got all over the place,\n",
      "and he goes to a lot of the Maverick games and everything.\n",
      "But, I, I, I can't get interested at all,\n",
      "zero.\n",
      "I, I listen to him,\n",
      "and occasionally I'll watch them on channel eleven,\n",
      "but gee,\n",
      "I can't, uh,\n",
      "more than five minutes of a basketball game, just seems about,\n",
      "that's it,\n",
      "of, uh, pro anyway.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "seems like you could set the score at a hundred and then give them five minutes to play,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "then it'd be the same result.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Because they, they start,\n",
      "they shoot so much,\n",
      "and then the last, what, five minutes they decide who's going to be the winner, I guess.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I'm surprised a little bit when you're talking about basketball how some players work.\n",
      "Mavericks had, oh two players this year that they got rid of last year.\n",
      "I'll think of them in a minute.\n",
      "Perkins, Sam Perkins,\n",
      "can't think of the other one.\n",
      "They're both.\n",
      "Tarpley,\n",
      "is he one?\n",
      "Pardon me?\n",
      "Tarpley?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "Tarpley,\n",
      "and they both left this past year,\n",
      "and both of them were on playoff teams, uh,\n",
      "so, they benefitted tremendously by leaving the Mavericks.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And Sam Perkins, here, he's one guy I did follow\n",
      "from,\n",
      "think he was in Virginia,\n",
      "I can't think of what school he went to,\n",
      "but from.\n",
      "I guess he's been here about five, six, seven years in the pros.\n",
      "And he was,\n",
      "he never quite achieved the, you know, the super stardom that he had in, in college,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, uh, basketball, they have a nice,\n",
      "I don't know if you've down to the sports for Reunion Arena.\n",
      "It's,\n",
      "Well, what kind of garden do you have?\n",
      "Well, we've tried having,\n",
      "let me turn the T V off,\n",
      "we've tried having a vegetable garden,\n",
      "and I'm from Chicago,\n",
      "and the way that, uh, bugs and weeds grow down here is very different from Chicago.\n",
      "And we have tried several years in a row,\n",
      "and we've given up, between the fire ants, the pill bugs, the weeds, the drought, and a hundred and ten degree heat all Summer,\n",
      "and we just kind of, uh, decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "We had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought, Who'd want to eat that stuff.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "You know, so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here,\n",
      "and, uh, if you really water a lot, you can do it,\n",
      "but, you know, when you have to pay for water, it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, right now we're just,\n",
      "Do you have a lawn?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we, we just try to maintain the lawn and the shrubs right now, and the trees.\n",
      "We have a peach tree.\n",
      "That's the extent of our, um, contributing to our food supply.\n",
      "But that's nice to have\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "So what do you do up there?\n",
      "Well, um, actually it,\n",
      "we've sort of had an ideal Spring.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "And, um, the, the peonies have been out for now about three weeks\n",
      "Oh, wow.\n",
      "and the roses have been blooming for two weeks,\n",
      "and the grass is, uh, this lush green,\n",
      "and of course I've got lots of weeds in mine because, I don't use any poison either.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But, um, you know, I just keep looking at,\n",
      "and I say, Jeez, you know, this is the first year it's been so perfect.\n",
      "Really.\n",
      "Gosh.\n",
      "But, and my garden, you know,\n",
      "my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall\n",
      "Oh, boy\n",
      "the plants and,\n",
      "that sounds wonderful.\n",
      "you know, I'm I'm going, Gee, this can't, you know,\n",
      "we'll have a freeze.\n",
      "If you don't have a frost you'll be all right\n",
      "That's what I remember from living up north, is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost\n",
      "and half the stuff would get frostbitten,\n",
      "and you'd have to.\n",
      "Well, that's it.\n",
      "Last year, I think it was, you know, my peonies were, were, budding in January,\n",
      "and, you know, there was no way that was going to make it,\n",
      "and sure enough, you know, we had really mild weather until I think it was May or something\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and then, you know, everything just got hit hard\n",
      "Oh, boy,\n",
      "that's frustrating.\n",
      "So, but yeah,\n",
      "it, it's interesting,\n",
      "and I enjoy gardening.\n",
      "My son does the mowing of the grass.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "my husband does that, thank goodness, because I, that's not a pleasure for me\n",
      "I don't think that's a pleasure for anybody, the the mowing.\n",
      "I love gardens that are well tended,\n",
      "and I just,\n",
      "there's been a few different places I've lived where I've just\n",
      "I don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what, but you could just tell that they had a love, uh, a love affair with their gardens, with beautiful wild flowers,\n",
      "and just,\n",
      "I love the host of colors that just keep coming all, you know, year long.\n",
      "And, uh, I, I was in England once,\n",
      "and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had, they had a beautiful garden in it.\n",
      "You know, it could be three feet by four feet or something.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So I do admire that, but I haven't really put, uh, too much energy into it.\n",
      "Course we have two little kids that are two and three years old\n",
      "Oh, they help you.\n",
      "So that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry, I'll tell you\n",
      "Oh dear.\n",
      "Oh but that's nice, you know,\n",
      "I mean the peach tree is, is a start\n",
      "and,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "that's really lovely.\n",
      "I would love to have different fruit trees.\n",
      "It's, it's been wonderful to have the peaches.\n",
      "They're just delicious.\n",
      "And, we, we we have, still have to spray some,\n",
      "but we don't have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison, which is good,\n",
      "because I just,\n",
      "I can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "What about tomatoes,\n",
      "aren't they pretty hardy?\n",
      "Um, we've tried them,\n",
      "but again, it's just like the sun scorch.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "We've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the\n",
      "I mean it's just,\n",
      "you really, really have to be prepared to water constantly during the Summer.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "People that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation and installed that,\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "and um, that's really what makes the most sense,\n",
      "because you don't have to use so much water,\n",
      "and\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "it really does the job.\n",
      "But it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here.\n",
      "And if you're not really committed to it,\n",
      "I mean, me, I'm, you know, I'm real committed to it for about a week, and then I forget about it for a week,\n",
      "and then I go, Oh, yeah, I need to do something,\n",
      "and by then it's burned up, you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives,\n",
      "so maybe when I get older I'll find, uh, some joy in that\n",
      "Well, I would assume, too,\n",
      "I mean, you've got three or four months you're talking about of, of bad weather.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it just gets so hot so fast here.\n",
      "We don't have really a Spring or a Fall\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it just, uh, immediately heats up.\n",
      "So, that's one thing I miss about living up north, as I remember, um, you know, the long Springs and long Falls and the cooler weather.\n",
      "It was really nice.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "We always had gardens when I was, uh, living in Chicago.\n",
      "In fact, my mother once tore up our entire back yard and redid it.\n",
      "I'll never forget.\n",
      "Got my stepfather to put in, uh, a waterfall and a little pond in one corner.\n",
      "I mean, that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time I ever knew him\n",
      "They remodeled the entire back yard.\n",
      "Then they sold the house and got divorced,\n",
      "so I don't know what that says about it all\n",
      "Oh, dear.\n",
      "Oh, but she used to love to do stuff like that.\n",
      "Sounds like it would have been pretty.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it really was.\n",
      "I enjoyed it there.\n",
      "But maybe when the boys get a little older, we'll do some more planting,\n",
      "because they like to see things grow.\n",
      "They've done a couple of little seed projects,\n",
      "and so I think it would be fun for them.\n",
      "Oh, sure,\n",
      "sure.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Well, it sounds like you, you've got your hands full\n",
      "Oh, yes\n",
      "They're both running around now.\n",
      "And, you know, gardening isn't, isn't high on the list,\n",
      "but it's not off the list.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, it's very therapeutic,\n",
      "I think, really to get out there and dig in the dirt, you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "They certainly enjoy that part of it\n",
      "It's just trying to keep anything.\n",
      "I planted bulbs last, uh, Fall on the side guard, and when I went out there in the Spring\n",
      "and the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off,\n",
      "and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "He thought, what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with?\n",
      "At least he didn't eat them,\n",
      "I mean, I guess I could be thankful for that.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Maybe next year they'll do better.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "really.\n",
      "If they survive this year.\n",
      "Oh, well, good luck to you.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "well, thanks.\n",
      "Nice talking to you.\n",
      "It was nice talking to you too.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "Have you ever, uh, organized a family reunion?\n",
      "Uh, no\n",
      "I have never organized one.\n",
      "But we are, we have one, uh, we are going to have one on Memorial Day, I guess.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "They have had one the last two years. We go out to the, my dad's farm and, uh, and, you know, it is just a picnic and spend the night. Go fishing and stuff like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "How many people usually show up?\n",
      "Oh, about ten.\n",
      "Oh, it is not that big.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Because, uh, we have had sort of weekends like that too.\n",
      "It,\n",
      "But I never thought of it really as a reunion.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I sort of think of a reunion with my, uh, all the extended family\n",
      "Everybody,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That would be hard for us because most of the family is out in California.\n",
      "And some is in New York and North Carolina,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and it gets,\n",
      "it is kind of hard to get get everybody organized.\n",
      "Uh, is there someone,\n",
      "do you all just sort of chip in and help out with stuff when you are there?\n",
      "Or,\n",
      "Uh, yes.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "My, my, uh, dad has a house out there anyway.\n",
      "And there is, there is, uh,\n",
      "he keeps a uh, food out there, year round.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, so he does not live there though?\n",
      "Uh, no.\n",
      "It is, it is, it is like a country, country home.\n",
      "Vacation home.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It sounds nice. Uh,\n",
      "are there kids that are there too, or mostly adults?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "The grandchildren.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Just a few.\n",
      "It just depends,\n",
      "uh, uh, all my grandparents are dead so, uh, there is, there are not, you know, none of them are there.\n",
      "And, and, uh, then an uncle is dead.\n",
      "So the, the big family is a lot smaller that it used to be.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Are you all located in Texas?\n",
      "Uh, yeah.\n",
      "We are in, we are all, uh,\n",
      "like they live up in Sherman.\n",
      "It is near Lake Texoma.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "uh, all of his children live in the Dallas area too.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That to me is,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "Dallas I know of,\n",
      "Houston I know of,\n",
      "and that is about it In Texas.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "The rest of it is sort of a big void to me.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But, uh, you know, we have, uh, well,\n",
      "we all got together,\n",
      "it was about two years ago for,\n",
      "I was,\n",
      "I had graduated from college.\n",
      "And, uh, I was going to live in France for a year.\n",
      "And so my parents invited,\n",
      "it was not just family,\n",
      "it was friends too.\n",
      "But, uh, we all got together for just a party.\n",
      "And that was kind of fun.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Nice to have everybody together at once and things like that.\n",
      "French reunion?\n",
      "Well, not quite French,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but, uh, it was sort of a reunion before leaving.\n",
      "It was fun.\n",
      "It was on, uh, New Year's Day.\n",
      "So it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It was kind of fun.\n",
      "But, uh, but who was it?\n",
      "A friend of mine had a big family reunion a couple of years ago\n",
      "and, you know, everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend.\n",
      "And it really sounded like it was fun.\n",
      "But, I am not quite sure what I would do.\n",
      "I think it would be fun to like rent a big mansion or house someplace, and have everybody meet someplace where they do not really know. And have different areas to explore and things like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So that would be kind of fun.\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "Where nobody lives\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "But at least that way it is at nobody's house, so nobody one, no one person is responsible for everything.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And they do not have to clean up afterwards.\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That is for sure.\n",
      "The cleaning up can be a mess.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But uh, do you have horses or anything at your dad's farm?\n",
      "I am, I am sorry?\n",
      "Does, does your dad have horses there?\n",
      "Uh, no,\n",
      "he does not really have any, any, uh, uh, domestic livestock anyway.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, he leased, uh, to his neighbor for the cattle to feed on.\n",
      "I see,\n",
      "so it's,\n",
      "so he really does use it as a vacation home.\n",
      "It is not like a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Pretty much.\n",
      "He has a garden and, uh, a lot of fruit trees and blueberry bushes and things.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, that sounds nice.\n",
      "Do people actually pick the fruit and things?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And then there is wild blackberries there too.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I, used to, we used to go pick wild blackberries at my friend's property,\n",
      "he gets,\n",
      "but we never got enough.\n",
      "I used to make jam,\n",
      "but I never had enough to really make, you know, more than a jar or something.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "So it was not so worth it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It is kind of, they're kind of off and on it seems like.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Depends on the rain.\n",
      "That sounds,\n",
      "is,\n",
      "does he have a lot of land to go walking around and things there?\n",
      "Uh,\n",
      "it is, uh, it is, uh, eighty acres.\n",
      "Well, that is pretty big\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I do not know how they do scale down there.\n",
      "You know, here it would be a huge amount of land.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Because they,\n",
      "is\n",
      "this house here that has a lot of space is three or four acres. As opposed to tens of acres.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, uh,\n",
      "and most of it, you know,\n",
      "you just spend time on maybe ten acres of it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, because that is where the ponds are and where everybody fishes.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "We kind of have a, an informal contest.\n",
      "My uncle, uh, put some bass in, uh, his pond a few years ago.\n",
      "Well, he put some crappie too.\n",
      "But the bass,\n",
      "we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet.\n",
      "So,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "they are in there, but they are real spooky.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I think my dad put some.\n",
      "We have a little pond at our, at his vacation home too.\n",
      "And,\n",
      "I mean really little.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in,\n",
      "and there were too many little goldfish,\n",
      "and so the big ones never got bigger.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "And, uh, somebody suggested to get a bass.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again\n",
      "Never saw the bass?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "So we do not know whether it is living\n",
      "or,\n",
      "Oh, it is probably in there just burping goldfish.\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We still have lots of little goldfish.\n",
      "They propagate pretty well, those little fish.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they really do.\n",
      "because we started,\n",
      "we have got hundreds in there now,\n",
      "and we started with, I think, ten or twenty little feeder fish that I picked up for a dollar, you know, no matter how many it was for a dollar.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, and some of them are probably eight inches long.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But he wants your really big ones, you know, the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long.\n",
      "Oh,\n",
      "And,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "It,\n",
      "They\n",
      "there is a, uh,\n",
      "you might put some, like some yellow catfish in there.\n",
      "I do not know if they would live very well up in New York,\n",
      "but they get huge.\n",
      "And, uh, they routinely use them for bait for, uh, goldfish for bait for yellow catfish.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "Well, we would want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys, the goldfish too\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, yeah.\n",
      "We could see.\n",
      "I do not know if yellow catfish live up this way.\n",
      "But catfish do, I think.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "They live in the Mississippi River all the way through Minnesota and up into Canada.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, that,\n",
      "you mean,\n",
      "well, we could try it.\n",
      "That is a good idea.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Because he was trying to catch them, you know, using little, uh,\n",
      "I forget,\n",
      "there's little, uh, nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that. Minnow nets or something.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "My father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish.\n",
      "And it was really funny,\n",
      "because, uh, one time he left the net in the pond,\n",
      "and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish.\n",
      "And, uh, he left it in the middle of the pond\n",
      "And that night he came out, and the trap was gone.\n",
      "And it was a raccoon that had taken it.\n",
      "So it was really funny.\n",
      "And you could see that, you know,\n",
      "you could see where the trap, the trap was dragged and things like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And so,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That is what happens\n",
      "But do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there?\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "And, uh, we feed the catfish.\n",
      "They feed the catfish like, uh, every couple of weeks.\n",
      "And, uh, and sometimes that is the best time to catch them.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Because they will just, they will just come after anything then.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And you could catch a couple anyway during that time.\n",
      "What do you feed them?\n",
      "Uh, mixed Purina, uh,\n",
      "it is, uh, cat food, uh, catfish food.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And it is especially made for catfish.\n",
      "But,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, I do not know how much different it is from dog food but, you know, it is, uh, it looks like Purina High Pro.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That is funny.\n",
      "But they come up to the top.\n",
      "And it is the best time to take pictures,\n",
      "because they come up to the top, and you can see their whiskers come through the water.\n",
      "And they're,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "the the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I have never seen catfish, you know, except in filleted on a plate, I think maybe.\n",
      "I think I have seen once or twice in like the museum.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But I have never seen them, just alive someplace.\n",
      "That would be fun to see.\n",
      "Well, they are really funny fish.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "When you catch them, they make a kind of a, a burping, growling sound at you.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And they try to hit you with their tails.\n",
      "How big do they get?\n",
      "Oh, well, the channel catfish get up to, uh,\n",
      "I think the world record is fifty some pounds.\n",
      "Uh,\n",
      "Do you know?\n",
      "that, that is only about three and a half feet long.\n",
      "That is pretty big though.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "they get real fat.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, from the time,\n",
      "they, they stay slender until they get to be, uh, eighteen inches long, and then they start to widen out.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, my daughter, we were up there one time and my daughter was fishing\n",
      "And I think that was when she was three.\n",
      "And she caught a catfish by accident.\n",
      "She was fishing for sunfish.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And she said, \"Here,\" and she handed me her rod and reel\n",
      "And, and, uh, you know, it was just pulling drag out.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And it swimmed wherever it wanted to.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That sounds amazing.\n",
      "I will have to see them sometime.\n",
      "But, all righty.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "It was nice talking to you.\n",
      "Nice talking to you too.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Enjoy your, uh, weekend.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Have a nice Memorial weekend.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "You too.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "now you can tell me what you do.\n",
      "Uh, well, I work with computers, just like your son\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I actually do research in speech recognition\n",
      "Oh, great.\n",
      "part of the reason I'm participating in the project is to see how the stuff goes.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, um, I was working\n",
      "well, actually I haven't worked for any large companies per se uh, recently\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but hopefully the job that I will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Well, the one John works for seems to have a you know, good benefits,\n",
      "and the pay is decent.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "the, uh,\n",
      "well actually, where I was working the company\n",
      "one of the companies I was working for actually had very good health care benefits which these days I think are really important\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "because health care is so ridiculously expensive.\n",
      "Because we're, we're paying our own insurance right now.\n",
      "uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "But and I'm,\n",
      "we actually had a little baby so I'm taking a little bit of a time off from work.\n",
      "Oh,\n",
      "Great,\n",
      "I had, I had a granddaughter\n",
      "Oh, congratulations.\n",
      "And so one thing that I'm very concerned with now is first of all health benefits\n",
      "because it's more important with a family\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and you know, our doctor's routine doctor's visits covered,\n",
      "my health insurance only covers, um, the emergency care.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Do you have major medical benefits?\n",
      "Right, yeah,\n",
      "but I don't,\n",
      "That, that helps some,\n",
      "if,\n",
      "it depends on what your deductible is how high it is.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Well, my,\n",
      "our deductible's five hundred\n",
      "but it's for each event.\n",
      "Each person.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's pretty that's pretty high,\n",
      "Right\n",
      "but, you know, so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "it doesn't cover doctor's visits, things like that.\n",
      "That's, that's right.\n",
      "And five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical, too.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "it certainly is.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I know where my daughter works,\n",
      "now she, she,\n",
      "course we live in a, a rural sort of setting\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and where she works she has no benefits at all.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "And her wage is not, not very good\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But it's, it's the type of area we live in.\n",
      "Of course, living expenses aren't as bad either, though, which makes a difference.\n",
      "And probably the medical care is less expensive, too.\n",
      "Well, she has to pay for it herself\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "you know, they have to pay for their own insurance.\n",
      "But, uh\n",
      "So I think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there,\n",
      "and so the insurance would cost lower,\n",
      "Uh, well, from what I've seen,\n",
      "from my aunt and uncle really from Florida up to here,\n",
      "they're not that much different.\n",
      "Well, I know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in Manhattan.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "And they were at one of the better hospitals, you know\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, you know, good doctors in Boston.\n",
      "Wow\n",
      "that's a big difference.\n",
      "And I was at one of the big hospitals in New York.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But that's a huge difference just between\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "you know, and it's two big cities that I think of as somewhat comparable.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "should be.\n",
      "So I was pretty shocked at that.\n",
      "But the other thing that I'm really concerned about,\n",
      "and most companies don't have,\n",
      "some are starting to have, is day care\n",
      "because it would be really nice to be able to have, you know, someone that could watch my daughter at work.\n",
      "And I'd go to work,\n",
      "and if she were sick I could go down and see her, if she needs to be fed, whatever.\n",
      "And it would be much more convenient.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "And I,\n",
      "it would be more convenient, too.\n",
      "It would be more convenient, more productive I think,\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "My other daughter works and has,\n",
      "they have to take their two children to day care, you know.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, it, it's,\n",
      "I don't know how they do it,\n",
      "I really don't. You know,\n",
      "getting them there and then, and going to work, and then picking them up and, all the preparations.\n",
      "And, and your hours are, much more constrained and things like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "And, that, to me, well, that, you know,\n",
      "those three things, the health care, vacation, and day care are probably the most important benefits.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I suppose I should be concerned with life insurance and, uh, retirement plans\n",
      "but,\n",
      "Oh, I don't know,\n",
      "I think those benefits you mentioned, sometimes they're even more important than the wage itself.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "If you can get those benefits even, uh,\n",
      "they, they come out to much, a much better benefit than, than an increase in your wage a lot of times.\n",
      "Right\n",
      "because you're, you know,\n",
      "certainly something like day care at the work place would make life so much simpler that it's worth paying, you know, having a lower salary.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "I would certainly accept a lower salary for that. You know, everything else being equal\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "it would make it a lot better.\n",
      "because your life would be so much easier.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And there's a question of quality of life also.\n",
      "Uh, well, and if it was there, you would really have a little more, uh, knowledge on what's going on probably, you know, with your child.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "and, you, you, you don't feel like you're a half hour away if she something happened. And, you're less preoccupied with it, I think.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "But unfortunately, there aren't,\n",
      "I think I B M has started having that in certain locations.\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "my daughter, one daughter works for M C I,\n",
      "and they don't, they, where she works they don't have anything like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Is that locally?\n",
      "Uh, Pittsburgh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "because Pittsburgh's a big enough city, too.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But you know, I wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones. Just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and things like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "Because many times small companies offer better benefits in terms of quality of life than larger companies.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Like, uh, one company had proposed to me that I could come back to work after having the baby, um, any where between ten and forty hours a week. And, um, call my own days, call my own hours,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, so they were very flexible\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and that, that would be great,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "and which\n",
      "many times at a large company it's almost impossible to do things like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "They say you're going to do it this way, and that's the way it's going to be.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And if you get two weeks off, you get two weeks off and you're not allowed two weeks and one day.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "So it all depends on what your position is there, too.\n",
      "True,\n",
      "well, that's true in any, any company, I think.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I've, I've never, well I can't say I've never,\n",
      "I've maybe worked five years out of our married life out of the you know, out of the home\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, uh, the rest of the time I've been an Avon lady and a lady.\n",
      "Was that when you were, um, well,\n",
      "those have its pluses and minuses, too.\n",
      "I've been a consultant recently and so I don't have any benefits at all\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "and you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "and the same thing\n",
      "my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that than what he is\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, um, they, they, they,\n",
      "Usually consultants make very good income.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "and they, they refuse to give him more salary.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Because they say they can't pay more than this and that, and they're not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, you know, times are rough now,\n",
      "so it's, new,\n",
      "it's harder to get the, uh, you know, increases and things\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, um,\n",
      "A consultant really is, should be more knowledgeable than everybody else, you know\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well he's,\n",
      "so it stands to reason they should really have more benefits.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "well, he's been doing a long term,\n",
      "he's being called a consultant,\n",
      "and he's really sort of a temporary employee at a place.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "And, they, they pay him as a consultant but he doesn't get any health benefits,\n",
      "he doesn't get, well\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "we don't care about retirement benefits.\n",
      "He doesn't get, um, vacation benefits\n",
      "and he does a lot of things that get factored into somebody else's salary.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So really his salary should be, you know, twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that, not including the fact that you know, it's a less, long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and they'll do it,\n",
      "Do you or your husband work for T I,\n",
      "or\n",
      "I'm a contract person at T I in fact involved with, uh, Data Switchboard\n",
      "Oh, are you,\n",
      "Oh, I see.\n",
      "Well, that's neat.\n",
      "and, uh, do you work for T I?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, I've worked for them for several years, like twelve now, I guess.\n",
      "Oh, you sound very young like just out of college\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "I try to,\n",
      "I try to think of myself as young,\n",
      "but, uh, well, have you seen any movies recently?\n",
      "Uh, I'm trying to think,\n",
      "we saw, uh, DANCES WITH WOLVES\n",
      "Oh, did you?\n",
      "and, uh, have you seen that one?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I haven't,\n",
      "I have, have a hard time with movies that are real long.\n",
      "That was excellent.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "Well, so oddly enough, I do too,\n",
      "I get tired of sitting there, and so does my husband,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but we both just thoroughly, you know enjoyed it, just really liked it\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, I've heard a lot of good things about it.\n",
      "and, uh, I'm trying to think,\n",
      "we went to see a, uh, a real funny one,\n",
      "I can't think now what the name of it was\n",
      "I've gone blank.\n",
      "We saw THE NAKED GUN, TWO AND A HALF\n",
      "Oh, we have not seen that,\n",
      "we want to see that one.\n",
      "and that was, that was pretty funny,\n",
      "and then we saw,\n",
      "what was the spoof on TOP GUN,\n",
      "it's\n",
      "Oh, I haven't seen that one.\n",
      "oh, I can't think of what that was called.\n",
      "We saw that too,\n",
      "I was pretty disappointed in that one.\n",
      "Were you.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but, uh, so, you know, through the summer,\n",
      "we have small children, so we don't get to see too many, but we've seen I guess two or three movies this past summer.\n",
      "My husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them,\n",
      "he likes to rent them\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and so we watch a lot of them, you know, at home as they come out,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and, uh,\n",
      "Have you seen GHOSTS yet?\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "I really, I enjoyed that movie,\n",
      "Did you?\n",
      "Now I, I was real disappointed\n",
      "Really.\n",
      "I'm a real big Patrick Swayze fan\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, I was really disappointed in it,\n",
      "it\n",
      "one,\n",
      "I don't think it was as funny as what I was anticipating,\n",
      "and I guess I was expecting it to be kind of funny and, uh, and it wasn't you know, at all,\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "well,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "it was, it was more of a love story\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and, uh, so I was really disappointed in that because I like him real well.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "We just got through watching one with, uh, uh, is it Claude Van Damme yeah, and, uh, enjoyed it,\n",
      "Uh, Van Damme,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I think,\n",
      "I can't think what the name of\n",
      "it was a, uh, of course, one of the typical you know, kicking, fighting lots of blood and guts and all that type movie,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, and we enjoyed that,\n",
      "and, uh, the, uh, uh, the one with Jody Foster, did you see it?\n",
      "Oh, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I did.\n",
      "Wasn't that excellent?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I really enjoyed that a lot.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that was one that, that stayed with me you know, for a month,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I just,\n",
      "I kept thinking about it, you know,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, it's amazing,\n",
      "but really, I mean, when you stop and think about it, Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie\n",
      "No.\n",
      "and yet it was his character that was so intriguing,\n",
      "Oh, it was excellent,\n",
      "and, and, of course, he's such a, uh, very good actor anyway\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and, I think he made the movie,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I do too,\n",
      "I really did\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "you know, Jody Foster was good, too, but I think, I think Anthony Perkins was the one that, that really made the movie,\n",
      "I agree with you.\n",
      "Is it Anthony Perkins or Anthony Hopkins?\n",
      "Oh, Hopkins,\n",
      "I'm sorry\n",
      "Hopkins,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Hopkins,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "I always get those mixed up.\n",
      "I know\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "It, uh, well,\n",
      "I'm not a real big Jody Foster fan,\n",
      "but I thought she was good in that.\n",
      "Well, I\n",
      "well, I haven't been,\n",
      "I'm, I saw her in THE KEYS,\n",
      "and I thought that was a pretty good movie,\n",
      "but I thought she,\n",
      "Now, I didn't see that one.\n",
      "That was, that was pretty interesting movie,\n",
      "and, uh, but, you know, I, I did,\n",
      "I really liked the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,\n",
      "that was really intriguing,\n",
      "and it, it didn't scare me all that much, you know,\n",
      "and I, I don't like to go to movies to be scared,\n",
      "that's not why I go\n",
      "No,\n",
      "no\n",
      "so,\n",
      "I like a good suspenseful story,\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "and that one was.\n",
      "and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats,\n",
      "in fact, I want to, uh, rent it when it comes out for my husband to see,\n",
      "because, he didn't\n",
      "Oh, he didn't see it?\n",
      "he won't go see that,\n",
      "no,\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "I went with, uh, our daughter and, uh, so, you know, saw it with her, and, uh, enjoyed it.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "My all time favorite is WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S.\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "Did you see it?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I've seen it.\n",
      "Oh, I've seen it, you know,\n",
      "we saw it at the movies,\n",
      "and then we've rented it several times\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, we just love it,\n",
      "in fact we have a ten year old grandson that,\n",
      "he and my husband and I, we just sit there and cackle you know, just get hysterical.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I've seen that.\n",
      "It's pretty, it's pretty cute.\n",
      "I guess, you know, as far as comedies go, probably my favorite is YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN.\n",
      "Uh, yes,\n",
      "yes,\n",
      "I love that movie,\n",
      "My husband liked that\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "so,\n",
      "uh, he's a big Gene Wilder fan,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, Gene Wilder doesn't do that much for me,\n",
      "but I'm a big, uh, Mel Brooks fan\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "all his movies, I really, really .\n",
      "He has a new one out.\n",
      "He does?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, I have seen it advertised.\n",
      "I don't know what the name of it is.\n",
      "Oh, is that the one with, that's he's starring in?\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "that came out, like early in the summer or something like that.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I haven't seen that one either.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "my husband wants to see that one,\n",
      "and, uh, did you see that one that he made years and years ago about the, uh, the sheriff\n",
      "Oh, BLAZING SADDLES.\n",
      "BLAZING SADDLES.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, that's my husband's all time favorite, I think.\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "I like, I like that one too, but I thought YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN was better.\n",
      "Did you?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that, that was just, you know, had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie,\n",
      "I just really enjoyed it,\n",
      "and, uh, um, I'm trying to think,\n",
      "because we saw another one that we thought was really good, early this summer, that was a suspenseful movie.\n",
      "I'm trying to remember what it was,\n",
      "because it, you know, it's,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Capital punishment.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "what's your views on it?\n",
      "Um, for myself, I'm personally against it,\n",
      "but we seem to have a duality of, in this country where most states in theory have it, but, but, but do not use it.\n",
      "Correct.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "well, I'm for it.\n",
      "I think there are certain crimes that definitely, uh, call for it.\n",
      "I, I feel like that child molestation and murder\n",
      "I don't see any sense in someone living that does things like that.\n",
      "I, I don't feel like they're a benefit to society in any way,\n",
      "and of course Texas has it, but they very seldom, you know, put it into effect.\n",
      "So instead all of our prisons are full of people on, you know a lot of people on death row.\n",
      "Okay, well,\n",
      "Uh, Texas uses it as, about as much as any other state.\n",
      "Well, uh, yeah\n",
      "Texas is a big state,\n",
      "which is not very often.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Um, here in Maryland to the capital punishment law,\n",
      "people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment, but no one, no one has, actually has the sentence carried out.\n",
      "Uh, I'd certainly,\n",
      "What do they do, just keep them on death row for the rest of their life.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I think so.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I, uh,\n",
      "or affair number\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "uh, in fact, I think that, it, it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available,\n",
      "the sentence of life without possibility of parole, uh, has become a common one, and is being, being used much more.\n",
      "Do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here?\n",
      "Uh, I don't know the exact numbers,\n",
      "but, but yes,\n",
      "prisons are overcrowded.\n",
      "I know that we have, you know,\n",
      "really in fact they're, they're releasing people, uh, that are in there for, you know, not major crimes, but, uh robberies and assault and things like that,\n",
      "and, because they don't have room, which then they're coming back on the streets and of course, doing it again,\n",
      "and um, you know, so we're having problems in, in that way,\n",
      "and I know that there are some cases that, uh, you know, capital punishment does not fit the crime,\n",
      "and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types, um, but I have to say that I'm honestly for it\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "uh, almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "you're, you're certainly in the majority uh, at least in this country.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Uh, we are, I guess, the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment.\n",
      "I know they use it very, um,\n",
      "they do not have it in Europe, as I understand.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "at least not in Western Europe.\n",
      "Probably not in Eastern Europe these days either.\n",
      "Um, there are many reasons for it,\n",
      "but they, they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "you wonder what their, you know, how they manage to do that.\n",
      "Well, in part it's, uh, it's the nature of societies, perhaps more homogenous society, in many cases, uh,\n",
      "arguably, if\n",
      "arguably is because of, of, uh, of, uh, welfare state benefits.\n",
      "Though I tend to be, we tend to be skeptical.\n",
      "Well, England has, uh, don't they have a large, fairly large welfare?\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "oh there's no question that, that they, that, uh, you know, they have, you know, all kinds of cradle to grave, uh, programs, welfare programs providing for everyone some way.\n",
      "I, I, I,\n",
      "however the question is is that making the difference.\n",
      "Oh, I, I don't know.\n",
      "But we have a lot of welfare programs\n",
      "and\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "if both do and they tend to have less crime, you wonder if that has anything to do with it then,\n",
      "you know, or is it,\n",
      "in our society, people are brought up over here thinking that, you know, everybody owes them something.\n",
      "Um, I think, I think that idea is even, even more common in Western Europe.\n",
      "Oh, do you?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, that's interesting.\n",
      "I would not have, I would not have said that.\n",
      "I would have said that it was more prevalent here in the United States.\n",
      "That's an interesting theory.\n",
      "I'm not that familiar, you know,\n",
      "I've only been over there a couple of times\n",
      "and I'm not that familiar with, that,\n",
      "Me, too.\n",
      "all I know is that, for instance we were in Germany in, uh,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Why don't you go ahead and start.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "well, we subscribe to PEOPLE magazine and to TIME,\n",
      "and, of course I like the PEOPLE magazine because it's gossipy and it's fast reading,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, the TIME of course, is, uh, you know, more newsworthy\n",
      "and, uh, it has more world affair type things, of course.\n",
      "And then I will purchase a GOOD HOUSEKEEPING occasionally, especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and and things like that\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, do you subscribe to any magazines?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, well, I have, in a for a while I haven't gotten any because I just find that I'm not reading what I'm getting because, uh, I have so much going on in my life\n",
      "that seems to be the last thing I pick up,\n",
      "so I found that I was wasting my money. As much as I enjoy them, uh, when I do subscribe\n",
      "I, I've gotten in the past the PARENTS magazine and, uh, the HOUSEKEEPING magazine\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "uh.\n",
      "you probably have smaller children younger children.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "My children, our children are grown\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "and, uh, I'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "well, I found that after a couple of years of having a PARENTS magazine it was getting repetitious,\n",
      "so I kind of canceled it anyway for that reason.\n",
      "Uh, the HOUSEKEEPING magazines I do like because they, like you say, they have nice, uh, recipes in them and ideas, but, uh, lately they've just been piling up on me,\n",
      "so I figured it wasn't, uh, something I needed at this point in time.\n",
      "Well, do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to?\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "I, I, well,\n",
      "my husband would love to have more.\n",
      "Now he's the type who will get the, uh, INC. magazine and MONEY magazine and all the financial type magazines,\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "now my husband does that,\n",
      "and\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "you know, and of course, uh, naturally WALL STREET JOURNAL, you know and, or SPORTS ILLUSTRATED,\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "but I don't know,\n",
      "I know a few people leafing through them at the store\n",
      "but you just don't hear people talk about them,\n",
      "and I know years ago, when, uh, my children were young and stuff, I just loved LADIES HOME JOURNAL, McCALL'S, GOOD HOUSEKEEPING,\n",
      "and I took them all\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, then, oh, I don't know what\n",
      "in the seventies, maybe, late seventies they changed their format\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I haven't,\n",
      "I don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be\n",
      "Well\n",
      "even GOOD HOUSEKEEPING I don't,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "and some of those have had what, what I consider or what\n",
      "I get the idea that they are maybe the, the more pricier type magazines, as far as women's magazines.\n",
      "They seem just to be so chocked full of, of ads.\n",
      "Oh, they are.\n",
      "My sister, uh, takes, uh, TOWN AND COUNTRY and VOGUE\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and she sends them to me,\n",
      "and there's really nothing in them but advertisements for very expensive clothes, very expensive jewelry things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Right\n",
      "you know, and if I want to drool or if I want to see how the other half is living you know, then I can, I look through them\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and I do,\n",
      "I just,\n",
      "what I do is I flip through them and, and pitch them then, you know,\n",
      "they're not something I, you know, take any length of time over.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "I have discovered that, you know, with my available time, I would rather actually read a book than a magazine.\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "I enjoy books a lot more\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "that's true.\n",
      "and, uh.\n",
      "Well\n",
      "So, but.\n",
      "now I have certainly stopped subscribing as much as I used to,\n",
      "other than my children have gotten.\n",
      "You know, they get tons of magazines it seems\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "they're always getting something in the mail\n",
      "and, and, uh, so between reading to them and, uh, reading the newspaper,\n",
      "and then I have a book that I'm occasionally reading when I get a chance,\n",
      "but I just don't get a chance for those, uh, newsy magazines, the ones that are full of ads,\n",
      "unless you just want to skim through while you're,\n",
      "I, I read them when I'm at a doctor's office or, you know, waiting on something like that.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "yes,\n",
      "I will read them in a doctor's office, too.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "As I said, I, I subscribe to, uh, to PEOPLE and to TIME,\n",
      "and, uh, and I will go through the TIME, but, usually not cover to cover, you know,\n",
      "I'll glance through it.\n",
      "I like reading, uh, you know, the PASSAGE OF PEOPLE or something you know,\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, but I do like the PEOPLE magazine.\n",
      "It, it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when I was young\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, that's one, and you know, I really like that,\n",
      "I enjoy that.\n",
      "It's quick reading you know,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "it doesn't require a lot of thinking,\n",
      "and sometimes after I've worked all day and have things to do at night, I just, I want fluff\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "I don't want a lot of thinking\n",
      "That's true,\n",
      "that kind of is a good way to do it.\n",
      "It, uh, you know, it's, it's much more relaxing.\n",
      "Sometimes when I read TIME magazine, after I've read an article I'm real depressed over the situation of the world\n",
      "so. Well, it seems like we both kind of agree on the subject of magazines\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "and, uh\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "so, uh, I think that probably I will end the call.\n",
      "I've enjoyed,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Um, I very seldom read a newspaper.\n",
      "I get most of my news information from T V.\n",
      "Mainly, um, if I'm really wanting an in-depth thing I'll watch C N N.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I find it one of the best.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, otherwise it's just one of the regular, uh, channels eight or five.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, where do you get yours?\n",
      "Uh, mostly from T V too.\n",
      "I usually start watching the news at five and watch it at five thirty and six sometimes and, and then again at ten maybe just the headlines.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, we do take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS\n",
      "and, uh, once in a while I'll sit down and read, read it, you know,\n",
      "but not very often do I read the whole thing.\n",
      "Quite often just scan through the headlines\n",
      "and,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, I take the DALLAS MORNING NEWS\n",
      "and, and my husband, uh, he reads it cover to cover.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, if he thinks there's something that I need to know about he'll say, you know, here you need to read this\n",
      "and, uh I don't know\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "it,\n",
      "I kind of quit reading it, oh, I don't know several years ago when the kids were teenagers.\n",
      "It just seems like I was so busy all the time,\n",
      "and if I wanted to read, I wanted to read something light and relaxing and and, uh, things like that\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and so I\n",
      "and it got so depressing\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Seems like it wasn't anything but bad news\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "If there's something, you know, that I want to know more about or\n",
      "might be the Killeen murders.\n",
      "I've been kind of intrigued.\n",
      "I guess it's kind of the sadist in everyone\n",
      "You just,\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "I, I will pick up if there's something really gruesome in there\n",
      "I'll go through and read it.\n",
      "Uh, but I find that I do better with, oh, remembering it and everything if I watch, uh, the T V you know,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and, and they kind of capsize it and everything\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and watch,\n",
      "and I think sometimes it's, you know maybe a little biased, you know\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "and sometimes. You don't, you get the sensationalism as opposed to just pure facts.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "You know.\n",
      "I wanted a little more detail like, you know,\n",
      "they would tell more about the people that were killed, where they were from and how old they were.\n",
      "And I guess you just, you know, you you just want to know\n",
      "and with interest, you know I found some people that were members of our church which was different.\n",
      "And that made you even feel a little more kin to, to what was going on.\n",
      "Well, you know, of the same, same type of church that we belong to.\n",
      "Oh, the same type of church.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "so that made it a little more and that they were from Utah also\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "So that was interesting,\n",
      "but I enjoy the news.\n",
      "I, I think our seven year old even once in a while will sit down and watch it with us,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so.\n",
      "I used to, uh,\n",
      "or I didn't used to\n",
      "but, uh\n",
      "No.\n",
      "when my grandchildren had, uh, have stayed over before and even maybe when our kids were younger one of the channels used to give brief inserts of news at a child's level.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I thought that was very interesting,\n",
      "and I thought that was very important for kids.\n",
      "Like they brought down something that had happened like if there was something going on, uh, in the war, they would bring it down to a child's level in words you know, that they could understand what was going on.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, I noticed that my grandchildren seemed to kind of enjoy that.\n",
      "The oldest one he's nine\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and, uh, he would particularly enjoy this\n",
      "been a couple of years ago.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, uh, I thought, I think that's really interesting.\n",
      "Actually I even understood it better\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's nice sometimes when they they pull it down a little bit like that.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "you know. And, uh, but as I said, uh, I you know,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Nobody should get that way about the news. And what's going on in the world.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Oh, do you have a certain station you like to watch when you watch it\n",
      "or,\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "We like channel eight.\n",
      "Do you?\n",
      "We like it.\n",
      "It's the best.\n",
      "Um, channel five for some reason has always been the one I watch.\n",
      "Is that been your favorite?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I, I don't know\n",
      "it's probably the anchors.\n",
      "They just kind of catch you.\n",
      "I don't, I don't know.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I very\n",
      "and I thought it was very interesting, uh,\n",
      "channel nine watching it when the murders were in Killeen\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, and going on.\n",
      "They were having news coverage\n",
      "and,\n",
      "The C N N, is that what that is?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "it was channel nine.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "And, you know they have that hour that nine to ten of an evening.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And so we had the T V on\n",
      "and we were trying to catch all of it,\n",
      "and they were showing some\n",
      "and I was watching,\n",
      "my husband and I were watching it,\n",
      "and then we switched over to channel eight,\n",
      "and the difference in coverage was unbelievable.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I can understand why channel eleven is, uh, you know, why they're kind of behind.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Did I say channel nine to begin with?\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "That's why I wondered.\n",
      "No\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "No, channel eleven I meant.\n",
      "I don't get that channel\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I was thinking nine to ten.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "But channel eleven,\n",
      "That is if you, if you want to go to bed early\n",
      "it's nice to, to, to watch that early news sometimes,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "so.\n",
      "It, uh,\n",
      "but the coverage wasn't near as good as when we, you know, switched over to channel eight\n",
      "and they didn't\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "would you, uh, like to begin or would you like me to start?\n",
      "Uh, oh, I can start.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I, I think one of the, the biggest, uh, improvements in women is that finally you're starting to see them get into, uh, management\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "and you're seeing them, uh, get, uh, elected to, uh, political offices. Uh, not near enough.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I know there's still a long way to go especially in top management\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I agree.\n",
      "You're not seeing, you know,\n",
      "looking at T I, you see them in management, but you're not seeing them up there as V P\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And I have a sister that's an attorney in Oklahoma City,\n",
      "and I know the company that she was with, uh,\n",
      "the women didn't have near the positions, the levels that the men attorneys had. And were not, uh, given the same respect.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I agree with that.\n",
      "I, I think you do see more and more women out there in politics, too, as mayors or, uh, you know, in, in helping to maybe, uh, get some legislation passed to, to have women have more rights.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I think still, even with that whole, um, thing with Judge Thomas and, and, uh, you, you still felt like the woman was the one that you would maybe discredit first before the man\n",
      "or something the way they had the trial\n",
      "and uh, I just think that it's, it's still going to take another generation or so before, before the women really, could really feel that they're really equal in the business world and that they work just as hard or harder\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "Uh, but it's still, uh,\n",
      "going from, from homemakers into, uh, corporate leaders is still a big step.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "I also think that, uh, uh, women as homemakers are beginning to get more respect than they used to be.\n",
      "Used to be people would say, do you work, and you'd say, no, I work in the home\n",
      "and\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "it was, it was, then it was almost like a put down, particularly, particularly even by women in the work force.\n",
      "But, I think now, I think people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very, very important.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "And it's getting the respect and, which is about time.\n",
      "I think it's true.\n",
      "I think also people are having children at a older age\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "very definitely.\n",
      "so it's maybe like, uh, you know,\n",
      "you go through college\n",
      "and then you maybe work for a few years\n",
      "and then you have your first child\n",
      "and, uh, you know, you, you know both sides of the coin.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "You know what it's like and how much work it takes to keep the house running smoothly, and to take care of the kids.\n",
      "And, and then, uh, maybe people that are just working and think, oh, you just stay at home.\n",
      "But then when they're in their thirties and have their first and second kid, it's like, they lose it\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "They say, wow!\n",
      "This is harder than I thought\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Well, you know.\n",
      "And, and, to those that have never worked and had, you know, and have stayed home with the kids, kind of does your heart good\n",
      "I know it,\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Because I know I stayed home with mine and didn't start working until mine were in high school.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, so, you know, it, it kind of does me good.\n",
      "I think also one of the things that, that's really tremendous and, it doesn't necessarily have to do with women, but the fact that the fathers are so involved with families.\n",
      "Are so involved.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Which, again, I think it helps a woman's role.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "You know,\n",
      "Their role has to change to kind of accommodate us, too.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "I know,\n",
      "I have three children\n",
      "and my oldest is eleven\n",
      "and I've pretty much been home, uh, since Brian was born\n",
      "and, uh, just recently I went back to work, uh, last school semester to tutor, uh, high school age students with learning disabilities\n",
      "and I was just out of the house two days a week\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, I thought, wow, this is really hard,\n",
      "only,\n",
      "and it was only two days\n",
      "and I was home before three.\n",
      "But getting the baby to day care, getting the kids off to school, I still did everything I always do, you know,\n",
      "my husband still got up and went to work\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, uh, it, it,\n",
      "only those two,\n",
      "it made a big difference.\n",
      "I thought, wow, full time,\n",
      "I don't think I could swing that personally.\n",
      "Well, I had to,\n",
      "course, I work full time,\n",
      "but my daughter and her husband were out of town\n",
      "so I had my grandchildren for four days during, uh, football, soccer season\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Oh, boy.\n",
      "and so I would work\n",
      "and her,\n",
      "some friends would take care of the kids,\n",
      "but I would have to get them picked up from there get them fed, get them to practices get homework done, get baths.\n",
      "Pick up. Dinner.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I was absolutely exhausted.\n",
      "I bet,\n",
      "I bet.\n",
      "And, and these women that are waiting until they're in their late thirties, or early forties to have their first children, I think are absolutely crazy.\n",
      "Well, I, I know a lot of people,\n",
      "I know I had my first child when I was twenty-five,\n",
      "and that's not considered really young these days,\n",
      "that's almost, you know\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, uh, I have friends that, that have kids just starting kindergarten\n",
      "and they're, they're forty years old.\n",
      "And, and then like maybe a two year old at home,\n",
      "and I think, boy, I, I'm, I'm in my\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "do we just go ahead?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Do you want to start?\n",
      "Uh, well, we're supposed to talk about vacations\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "and, uh, I'm trying to think of the ones that I've been on that I liked the most\n",
      "and probably the one I liked most was Hawaii\n",
      "Oh, did you get to go to Hawaii?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we went there for our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary.\n",
      "It's lovely, isn't it?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "We went, uh, six months after we were married.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And we just went to, uh, two islands.\n",
      "What islands did you go to?\n",
      "We went to Oahu and Kauai.\n",
      "Kauai,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "We went to Kauai,\n",
      "and then we also hit Maui,\n",
      "and then, of course, uh\n",
      "The big one.\n",
      "uh, the big one,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "With, uh, the big one I thought was very commercialized.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "It was.\n",
      "But the other two were just lovely.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I enjoyed Kauai better, too.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "it was quiet and restful, and, and so beautiful.\n",
      "It wasn't commercialized.\n",
      "Oh, it was rainy\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "was it?\n",
      "Rainy,\n",
      "but, you know, we don't like to spend the money to go over there and sit on the beach anyway\n",
      "so,\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "Well, it wasn't real rainy.\n",
      "We had a few showers, but, uh, nothing that really got in the way with anything and just very brief ones\n",
      "and, and, when, uh,\n",
      "now we went to Nassau\n",
      "and my husband liked it better than he did Hawaii.\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "he really did.\n",
      "I don't know why.\n",
      "You know, he didn't like Oahu at all\n",
      "He thought\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Did you go there?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "That was wonderful\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and we both enjoyed it very much.\n",
      "That was That was nice,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "You know, I've been to Nassau, too.\n",
      "Have you?\n",
      "I went on a cruise.\n",
      "Oh, neat.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "and, uh, to tell you the truth, I, I think I'd rather just go to the island.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh, our son and daughter-in-law just, uh, they got married last January and they won a cruise.\n",
      "And I know they didn't like it.\n",
      "Now, we have several friends that, uh, have been on, and just love them.\n",
      "But James and I like,\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "I think we would get bored on the boat all the time.\n",
      "Well, I, got sick.\n",
      "Oh, did you?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I did the first night.\n",
      "I went with my sister just, uh, a couple years ago\n",
      "Ooh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, and we both, the first night, just had to leave dinner.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "It was bad,\n",
      "but, and then after that it was, it got better,\n",
      "but we just,\n",
      "it was a four day\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and we were both ready to get off the boat.\n",
      "Were you?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, I think if we ever go, it will only be for a three day.\n",
      "Now we've been real lucky.\n",
      "We've been to Europe twice.\n",
      "Oh, have you?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We went, the first time we went to London, Europe and touched a little bit of Scotland\n",
      "And second time we went to Munich, Germany and were there a week, and loved Germany.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "It is just absolutely gorgeous with the mountains\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "I'll bet it is.\n",
      "and we were there in the fall before the snows, you know, started\n",
      "and it was wonderful.\n",
      "It, uh it was just, it was marvelous.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And we would love to go back there\n",
      "and we'd love to go back to London.\n",
      "You haven't been to Spain?\n",
      "No\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "have not been to Spain.\n",
      "I was born there.\n",
      "Were you?\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "How old were you when you left?\n",
      "Uh, just ten months.\n",
      "Oh, ten months,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Have you ever got to go back?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "no,\n",
      "and I would like to.\n",
      "Would you?\n",
      "My, uh, my sister,\n",
      "we went with them to Germany\n",
      "and, uh, she would like to go to Spain.\n",
      "I'm not sure whether I would like to or not.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "And, uh, I would like to go to Ireland.\n",
      "Would you?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Now, now I don't know if I'd like to go there just from the the problems.\n",
      "Well, the\n",
      "there is\n",
      "uh-huh,\n",
      "is, is a little scary,\n",
      "but I would still like to see it.\n",
      "I'd like to see, uh, Italy.\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "I would love to go there.\n",
      "That would be nice.\n",
      "And, course, there is a lot of places in the United States I still want to come, you know, go to.\n",
      "Now, have you been to Yellowstone?\n",
      "Uh,\n",
      "Yellowstone,\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "yes.\n",
      "Have you?\n",
      "We have been there.\n",
      "We, I was there as a child and then we, we went to California and came back through Yellowstone with our kids.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And they loved it.\n",
      "Well,\n",
      "I was in Utah, in Salt Lake City when I was a, uh, youngster.\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "So, uh, you know, I've touched on that.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "now I'm just about, oh, a half hour, uh, north of Salt Lake.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "So, uh, it's at\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "my husband works in Salt Lake,\n",
      "so\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "we're real close\n",
      "and, yeah,\n",
      "we,\n",
      "Now that's a pretty city.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "we, we like it.\n",
      "Very clean. You know.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It is.\n",
      "Utah is a pretty state from what I remember of it.\n",
      "Well, we kind of like it\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "Well, do you like to camp, those kind of trips?\n",
      "We,\n",
      "no,\n",
      "we used to\n",
      "We used to camp a lot with our\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Oh, you like the motels?\n",
      "We like the motels,\n",
      "yes\n",
      "Oh, oh, well.\n",
      "We have, we've gone past the camping stage.\n",
      "We lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee for two years.\n",
      "Oh, did you?\n",
      "And we did a lot of camping out there in the Smokeys\n",
      "and it was beautiful\n",
      "and our kids loved it and everything\n",
      "and then we moved to, uh, uh, the Dallas area\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, it's hot down here\n",
      "and camping is not near as much fun.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And, uh, so, and then the kids were getting older and, and were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside. And, uh, although our son loves to fish\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "and, uh, and our daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping with their boys now that they have gotten older.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So I've been concerned about crime lately.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, it's really scary to listen to the news every night and to hear about all the problems.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I wondered if you were taking any special precautions in your neighborhood?\n",
      "Well, I, I think we have a neighborhood watch\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I think.\n",
      "I'm not real,\n",
      "we don't get real involved.\n",
      "We're never home,\n",
      "so\n",
      "Uh-huh\n",
      "uh, uh, well, I know they were going to start one,\n",
      "but, uh, I haven't heard any more since,\n",
      "so I don't really know.\n",
      "But as far as personally doing something, no.\n",
      "No, um.\n",
      "How about you?\n",
      "Well we moved in, when we moved in, there, there wasn't any outside lights\n",
      "and so we've been trying to install some, uh, outside lights\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and we put up a fence in the backyard.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Mostly, you know, not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in, but that our children would be safe playing in the yard. You know.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "And I guess most of the crime that I'm concerned about generally is against my kids. To let them go play with someone and because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything\n",
      "Oh, I'm sure it is.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and so I have to spend a good deal of time watching them walk down the street and, say, call me before you leave and come back\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and,\n",
      "We don't have any.\n",
      "We did install a, a a, uh, motion detector light back in our driveway.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And that was, mainly it was so when we pulled up, the light would come on,\n",
      "but also we have a boat back there\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief,\n",
      "so\n",
      "we thought with that light, you know, it would maybe keep them from doing something to the boat\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Well, we've been real lucky that,\n",
      "I don't believe there's been, you know, much trouble in our neighborhood,\n",
      "but it  but it does seem there, that there is a lot more here in Plano of, uh, just bored teenagers\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "that's\n",
      "Vandalism.\n",
      "what it is.\n",
      "We live in, Coppell\n",
      "and, and that's pretty much what it is, is you know, kids that are bored, like you say.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and they don't, uh,\n",
      "I know my sister-in-law who lives in our neighborhood they've had their,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "they parked their car out on the street before and it's been spray painted and a few things like that\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "and, course, you know,\n",
      "I don't know\n",
      "I'm getting scared for kids to get older,\n",
      "because you don't know if it's someone their teenagers know who, and, or is it just random crime,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but, uh, we've been real lucky that no one in my family with the, anywhere that they live has had, been a victim of, you know, a serious crime.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "But, uh, it's really scary to know that you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesn't mean you'll be safe\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, But, I guess I take a lot of, uh, little bit of, uh, safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are, like drug related or uh, things that,\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "places usually that I wouldn't be going. And things I usually wouldn't be involved in.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, uh, there's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but it is scary.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it is.\n",
      "Were you raised in this area?\n",
      "Really is\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm originally from Chicago, but I've been in this area, in the Lewisville area for, uh, let's see, about twenty-three years.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "So, has it been getting worse that you noticed, or  about the same?\n",
      "Oh  definitely.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "In the last few years, I think,\n",
      "and, uh, like I say,\n",
      "now I don't think necessarily in this area here, but just Dallas in general.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "I think back of when I was, uh, younger and in my party days, some of the things I did, you know, I wouldn't be caught dead, like, being out that late at night.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "In the dark parking lot\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Take a lot of chances.\n",
      "Well, I noticed that, uh, that, uh, when\n",
      "we, we moved here from Houston not too long ago.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And so, of course, we were interested in schools\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, but the schools in Houston all have big, tall fences around them\n",
      "and they're not really very safe\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and so it's been interesting to come to the Plano area where the schools don't have fences at all around them,\n",
      "and it's just a whole different idea that, that, at least the people here feel that their kids are pretty safe at school.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And in Houston that there was the mentality that they weren't safe at school.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "And so that's been something that's been good for the, you know, in this area that you feel like, uh, you know, there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I guess,\n",
      "I don't know how people live with that every day.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "I don't either.\n",
      "Pretty scary.\n",
      "Yeah, um.\n",
      "But, anyway, well, I guess I won't take up more of your\n",
      "Well, I am new to Texas,\n",
      "so I don't even know what the law is, in the state,\n",
      "Uh-huh?\n",
      "do you?\n",
      "Well, yes,\n",
      "of course, we do have capital punishment.\n",
      "And we've, you know, done away with our, quote, fair share number.\n",
      "Oh, that's right,\n",
      "I think now, that I recall, reading about it in the paper.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Um, you know, different things,\n",
      "is it restricted to certain crimes?\n",
      "Or just,\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "it's certain crimes, uh, capital crimes, murder, of course, uh, rape, this sort of thing.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um. Well.\n",
      "It seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks, you know, that get into the system.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I know,\n",
      "the one thing that I think is really sad about it, as I recall, from the articles that I've read, is that if, if people who have been there, are going to be killed. Um, there's people that come to the prisons and they're very violent\n",
      "and, they want,\n",
      "I mean they're anxious for someone to be killed\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I just,\n",
      "I can't see that.\n",
      "That happens on occasion,\n",
      "it sure does,\n",
      "maybe it just depends on, you know, how closely the crime, you know, has affected you personally.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "You know, I don't know,\n",
      "or a person personally.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "I think I would be, you know,\n",
      "I guess, really if I had to say yes or no, I guess I would say, you know, that I am in certain cases, in favor of the death penalty,\n",
      "I don't know that it's a big deterrent really.\n",
      "I don't know that it is.\n",
      "I don't know how we'd ever find out, you know, really whether it is or not.\n",
      "Well, there is so many chances for appeal, that it\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "oh, absolutely,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "it goes on for years and years, and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, taxpayer money.\n",
      "it's really sad.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "I just think, um,\n",
      "somehow I hoped that as a people we could be better than, than, um, expecting, the feeling that it\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "with,\n",
      "someone is calling for someone else to be killed, you know.\n",
      "Is really kind of bad\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "it is.\n",
      "It's a tough, tough question.\n",
      "It really is.\n",
      "I suspect I would be, uh, you know, a lot more favor of it if, you know, one of my children were, you know, brutally killed, or something like that.\n",
      "Like I say, I think it depends on how personally affected, you know, you might be by it.\n",
      "and there really are criminals that are hard-core and, repeat, and never have any chance for,\n",
      "Oh, absolutely.\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "Oh, I don't know,\n",
      "is it,\n",
      "do you feel at all like, it's a religious issue?\n",
      "Not with me personally.\n",
      "It is with a lot of other people.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's not, not to me personally,\n",
      "no.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "I don't know,\n",
      "sometimes I feel,\n",
      "I mean I do go to church and things.\n",
      "I don't know how I would feel about it.\n",
      "But like you say, if it hit you personally, closer at home you would feel, feel differently.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "That's a, it's a tough, tough question,\n",
      "it really is.\n",
      "Do you think most states have that\n",
      "So,  so he had to have a work visa there.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And of course they had a lot of musicians from, from other countries  and, uh, in the Mexico City Symphony.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But I think, um, like three out of the four other people in the trumpet section are from Mexico now.\n",
      "Oh, really.\n",
      "But I think the conductor, I don't know, or one of the conductors is, is from another country.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's like any other symphony.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "You know, and then, and Eduardo Mana's from Mexico\n",
      "so he had to,\n",
      "Well, I, um, I haven't really lived in a lot of big cities.\n",
      "I mean, I'm living in Dallas now.\n",
      "Plano is outside of Dallas,\n",
      "but, um, so I don't really have a lot of experience with air pollution.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "But, I know when I lived down in Houston, on the outskirts of Houston, there were some towns like Pasadena that had oil refineries,\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "And, um, if you would drive by there, like on your way to the beach or something, there would just be dumping this huge amounts of smoke, into the air\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "and it always smelled really bad.\n",
      "We know that, that was really, really, really bad for the atmosphere.\n",
      "What have you got up there?\n",
      "Well, I, I live out in the country,\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "so that part is good.\n",
      "Uh, we're maybe one hundred miles from Pittsburgh,\n",
      "which has a lot of pollution from their plants,\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "and right now in our area were fighting against a toxic waste incinerator. *sp: we're\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "And, uh, it won't be too for from where we live. *sp: far\n",
      "And everybody really has been, you know, fighting against it, because we, we do not want it.\n",
      "Well, we don't want one any place\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "we would like the, uh, industry to do more to take care of the waste products before they turn to incineration, because we feel that, uh, the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much. Huh-uh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It's just, I mean, it's just so bad that there is just so much going into the air\n",
      "and, and the little bit you say that there putting in here and there, and everywhere, it all adds up. *there they're\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Plus all the problems in the Middle East.\n",
      "With all that smoke and,\n",
      "Oh, that has to be terrible over there.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So it's just, um, why are we doing this to ourselves\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "I just don't know,\n",
      "but, um, I, you know, what really amazes me about, like that Pasadena area and the oil refineries, is that there would be houses and people living just really close to it.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean, between the freeway and the oil refinery, you would see a neighborhood.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "and you just thought, well, it's obvious that there's a lot going up in the air there,\n",
      "and what comes up, must come down\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Breathing it, we're breathing it all the time.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "And, and how, if they have all of those, um,\n",
      "toxicity, I mean, it, there's signs around saying how dangerous it is\n",
      "and here you are living ...\n",
      "Huh-uh\n",
      "That just doesn't make too much sense.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "And I figure we're paying to take care of this toxic waste, no matter who does it. and they have shown, some of the industries have been real good at, uh, uh, doing their part in, uh, reducing the amount that they have, *sd\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Uh, they've reused some of it, uh,\n",
      "it can be recycled, a lot of their things,\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "and that they've shown, that it, uh, to begin with, apparently it does cost more,\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "but, once they get started, it's really, it saves them money in the end,\n",
      "and it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "And if they would all,\n",
      "that's what, that's what we want done.\n",
      "Is, we want industry to take, you know, more responsibility in taking care of it.\n",
      "Well, um, individual companies and things are so selfish,\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "And their desires to save a few dollars and, and that\n",
      "they don't care about the environmental impact, that they make.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "they're greedy.\n",
      "It's money, is what is.\n",
      "It's, it's the money\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "They're making fantastic amounts on these things\n",
      "and, uh, even the incinerator, the money and the income that they're going to make off this, is, you know, just astronomical.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Well, have you ever visited, um, like Los Angeles or any place that's ever, it's kind of known, that it has, uh, pollution in it's air?\n",
      "We've never been,\n",
      "we went as far as, as, uh, like Las Vegas, and Yellow Stone Park,\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "We did go, we should have gone the whole way over,\n",
      "but we didn't.\n",
      "But, I understand that,\n",
      "we have an aunt that lives out there\n",
      "and, When she was visiting here, she would look up at the stars\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "She said they couldn't see those things out there, because of the smog and everything.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "That's so awful.\n",
      "Well, what about in New York.\n",
      "I guess you've gone that way, maybe.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Never been in New York\n",
      "I don't want to go there\n",
      "Pretty funny.\n",
      "Have you been there?\n",
      "Well, I've been to New York.\n",
      "I have relatives that direction.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "We have,\n",
      "it's, um,\n",
      "is it close to Phoenixville, Pennsylvania?\n",
      "Um, no,\n",
      "I never heard of that one.\n",
      "Because I have family there\n",
      "and,\n",
      "We're near Pittsburgh, Clarion University.\n",
      "Oh, huh-uh.\n",
      "It's pretty neat.\n",
      "It's, it's kind of northwest part of Pennsylvania.\n",
      "That's beautiful country up that way.\n",
      "I know,\n",
      "it's, um, very lush and pretty, Up in the, back in the east.\n",
      "It's really,\n",
      "Are you a young person?\n",
      "Well, I'm thirty-one.\n",
      "Thirty-one.\n",
      "You're, you're young\n",
      "Seems kind of old to me.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "you're young.\n",
      "You have a lot of life yet,\n",
      "and, and these,\n",
      "we have some people who say, well, this isn't going to affect me, this air pollution,\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "uh, older people,\n",
      "or they think they're far enough away from something, that it's,\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "and they don't realize these things are going to affect everybody.\n",
      "And if you're older it's not going to affect you that way.\n",
      "You have grandchildren,\n",
      "you have children, uh,\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Nieces, nephews, whatever, friends.\n",
      "Uh, everybody is going to be affected by it.\n",
      "That's really true.\n",
      "And we all, you know, need to be willing to help pay a little bit. Like,\n",
      "I've heard some people, uh, grumble about their, uh, cars passing their emission tests, and things,\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "and how they've had to, how it's more expensive and things.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "And I thought, well, it's so much better.\n",
      "They say it has really made a difference, though.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Now, see, we don't have that here, yet.\n",
      "Oh, you don't.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "we don't have that testing in that down here, yet.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "But they,\n",
      "I have read that, that, that it has really helped where the problem is greater, where the population is greater,\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "and that it has made a difference.\n",
      "Well, I really think it must.\n",
      "I think every,\n",
      "I mean, well, think about how many automobiles there are.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "And each is putting out,\n",
      "like we have a car,\n",
      "an older, one of our cars is an older car,\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "and every time you start it, from the tail pipe, it makes a black spot, on the cement,\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "And you know that, that is a sign.\n",
      "Something is coming out,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And that's, all cars are doing that.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And it's really polluting the air.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "If you have to put a price on it. Which is more valuable, life or paying a little more.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "And it's also, it's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer,  and things,\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "We sure wouldn't want, so much more people suffering from that.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And like I said, I think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it, because it's industry.\n",
      "We're paying industry to make the products\n",
      "and, we're helping pay for there making these end products that are, toxic waste.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Then, we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace,\n",
      "then they put it in the dump some place\n",
      "and they find out, well, this dump doesn't work\n",
      "so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else.\n",
      "We end up paying for it again.\n",
      "Now we're going to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "And we're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted.\n",
      "Pretty sad.\n",
      "Or the,\n",
      "where they want to put, the one area they want to put the incinerator is right in the middle of the Clarion, the two water sheds that feed Clarion river.\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "And, you know, it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there, because, if that water gets contaminated, it will go on down to Pittsburgh.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "It will, you know,\n",
      "it affects so many people.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "And it's just hard to think that they could allow them to do things like this.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "It's scary\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "It's scary.\n",
      "It really is.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "It's really awful.\n",
      "Well, I've really enjoyed the conversation.\n",
      "It's helped me to think more about some issues that I need to be thinking more about\n",
      "It is really a concern. Huh-uh.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "And it's, instead of waiting until it directly affects me, like you say, it's important to be involved ahead of time.\n",
      "Well, you have a good day.\n",
      "Well, you, too.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Huh-uh.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "I have got two.\n",
      "One is, uh, two\n",
      "and the other one's four\n",
      "and, uh, this is my first year of staying home.\n",
      "I've always had them in child care.\n",
      "Oh, well, then you are familiar with it?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "I, uh, I have grandchildren\n",
      "and I know, uh, one has gone to a, well, two of them have gone to preschool.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And I know what the experience my daughter has faced with that.\n",
      "Why don't you tell me what you have found.\n",
      "Well, uh, the,\n",
      "with our second sitter, the first one didn't quite work out, there were some things going on that I wasn't really happy with\n",
      "and so I felt that, that I need to move on with them\n",
      "and so I found another baby-sitter\n",
      "and she was wonderful\n",
      "except I thought that there were too many in the home\n",
      "and it just seemed like it was so hard to find, uh, really good child care.\n",
      "She was wonderful,\n",
      "it's just that I felt that there were too many in the home.\n",
      "It was in home child care.\n",
      "Okay, Okay,\n",
      "so it was in home child care.\n",
      "You took them to someone's home?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, both times?\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, and then I worked in, in the child care centers\n",
      "and I wasn't really happy with the particular one that I was working in\n",
      "so I just always had a fear about, you know, child care centers.\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "And then I just decided that I was just missing a lot of their time whether they were so little\n",
      "and, and I couldn't get off of work as often as I wanted to when they were ill\n",
      "so I just decided it was probably best just to stay home for a while until they were a little more, uh, independent\n",
      "and, uh, I could go back to work.\n",
      "I know that in raising my children, uh, I was fortunate,\n",
      "I didn't have to work,\n",
      "we didn't necessarily have a lot of things\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "That's how it's going now.\n",
      "But, uh, and, I know my daughter,\n",
      "because she has three\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I mean it's so expensive.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "You have to really make a lot of money.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And I'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what's going on in their life.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to Christmas programs in the middle of the day or something.\n",
      "Oh, no,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "You know, and I know that one of the day cares and it's a, a well-known chain, uh, she was not at all happy with.\n",
      "It was, there was too many children per person.\n",
      "They were just kind of left to play,\n",
      "there was no structure to,\n",
      "and the middle grandson went there as a, uh, like a preschool thing.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "She was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of, of learning and training and stuff.\n",
      "Not just there, you know,\n",
      "so he went like, uh, I think he went, well, five mornings a week, if I remember correctly.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "And, uh, you know, and it was supposed to be a base,\n",
      "you know, starting to learn the colors and, and learning to associate with children so that when he went to, you know, school and stuff,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, she was most unhappy with it.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "There was no structure,\n",
      "there was nothing to it.\n",
      "You know, and, uh, she pulled him out of that one and put him in a, another one that was excellent.\n",
      "It was, it was like a little kindergarten.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, they had hot lunches\n",
      "and, and they had classes that, you know, one class they'd do art.\n",
      "They even familiarized the children with computers.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Uh, it was just, it was really a very excellent one.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And how old was he?\n",
      "He's now five and a half.\n",
      "He's in kindergarten.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "This was last year.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, uh, so, you know, it helped him and, and the first one, uh, he went to a, uh, church preschool that was very good.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "The Methodist Church in Richardson.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "The big one\n",
      "and it was a excellent,\n",
      "they,\n",
      "very good.\n",
      "My little boy goes to the Methodist, uh, in Garland.\n",
      "Oh, does he?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I'm real happy with that one.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they, uh, the church ones, church ones seem to be very well run.\n",
      "Well, I've, I've heard that the Methodist ones are excellent.\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Even the even the Mother's Day Out programs, I heard, are real good.\n",
      "Oh. I had, uh, I just assumed that most churches, going by, you know experience there, that, you know, that they were good.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I I didn't know that, uh, you know,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I'm not that familiar.\n",
      "I just know that, you know, First United Methodist of Richardson was just a great program.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "because this is First United Methodist in Garland that he goes to\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I'm real happy with that.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's a pretty good size church, too, isn't it?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, Well, are you enjoying staying home?\n",
      "Well, that's a,\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "I am\n",
      "Uh, I taught for Richardson School District\n",
      "Oh, uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, I taught early childhood\n",
      "and I really enjoyed it,\n",
      "but it was just, it was taking a lot of my time\n",
      "and I noticed I was spending less and less time with them\n",
      "and it just seemed like they were sick more often\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and I just couldn't get the time off to,\n",
      "so,\n",
      "Well, isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal with young children. And have enthusiasm.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it is.\n",
      "It really is.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it really is.\n",
      "And I felt,\n",
      "Okay, uh,\n",
      "could you tell me what you think contributes most to, uh, air pollution?\n",
      "Well, it's hard to say.\n",
      "I mean, while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories, uh, pollute a lot, uh, if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano, uh, it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all.\n",
      "What do you think?\n",
      "Um, well, you talked about, uh, volcanos.\n",
      "I'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now, and, and what the amount of material that they do, uh, put into the atmosphere.\n",
      "I think probably the greatest cause is, uh, vehicles, especially around cities.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, uh, do you live right in the city itself?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I'm more out in the suburbs,\n",
      "but I certainly work near a city.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "so Can you notice,\n",
      "How about you?\n",
      "well it's, it's,\n",
      "I live in a rural area.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's mainly farms and, uh, no heavy industry.\n",
      "Attleboro, itself,\n",
      "I live in Rhode Island.\n",
      "Oh, I see.\n",
      "And, it's in the north,\n",
      "I live up in the, uh, northeast corner\n",
      "and Attleboro sits in just over the line, where T I's plant is,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "but there isn't a lot of heavy industry.\n",
      "There's the freeways\n",
      "and we get an occasional,\n",
      "it depends which way the wind's blowing from Boston, cause we're like forty miles south of Boston,\n",
      "so we'll pick up that.\n",
      "And, uh, I've noticed over the past say, maybe five or six years, uh,\n",
      "we live about twenty miles away from the state airport\n",
      "and I notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger,\n",
      "they're swinging wider so that now they are coming over, over our homes.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And, it seems like, uh, we're catching all that residue.\n",
      "I'm not sure if it's kerosene or what that's dropping.\n",
      "But, other than that, you know, we don't have the, unless we're catching it from the midwest, the emissions. You know from the power plants. Um.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You mean like from the coal.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "we generate,\n",
      "one of our, our biggest electrical plants in Rhode Island uses coal to, uh, generate electricity.\n",
      "Um,\n",
      "Um, there doesn't seem to be much emission from them,\n",
      "but I'm not sure about the rest of the country.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I notice locally a major problem is Kodak.\n",
      "Um, it's interesting\n",
      "because in order to, uh, keep with the E P A standards which, which tend to be visible, uh, what's coming out of your smokestack, they do all their emissions at night.\n",
      "Uh, so people get up,\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "well, is that right?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "people get up in the morning in that neighborhood\n",
      "and they've got this black ash on their cars, which, you know, seems to be,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "surprise, surprise.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I mean, I really think that if the E P A had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades, light up the sky, photograph the emissions at that point, and, uh, you know,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "There, there must be, uh, uh, some of the, some of the, uh, larger plants up, uh, up around one hundred twenty-eight.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um, we've got reports that, uh,\n",
      "during the night seems like they'd blow off their, their stacks from, uh, the warehouses, for powerhouses,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, they do that at night too, because, employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted, and, you know, spots all over them.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "So, you're right,\n",
      "they could do something about, about that, I guess.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That seems a little ridiculous.\n",
      "How are your, uh, your lakes,\n",
      "and, uh,\n",
      "Oh they've been getting cleaner.\n",
      "They have?\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "But, um, yeah,\n",
      "I'm not sure how much the water pollution is, is directly related to the air pollution, other than acid rain,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "Acid rain,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "that's, that's what I was, uh,\n",
      "I mean the stuff I've read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit, uh, overstated. That a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all.\n",
      "Um,\n",
      "I'm not an expert.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "no.\n",
      "Didn't they just have an article, oh, on, uh,\n",
      "they were dumping lime.\n",
      "Up here?\n",
      "Up, upstate New York somewhere, over huge areas,\n",
      "I haven't read that.\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "and they thought that was more beneficial because, you know it, it, some of it does soak in\n",
      "and some of it runs off right away into the, in to the streams and rivers\n",
      "and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I can't remember where\n",
      "I, I read that recently somewhere,\n",
      "and I can't remember where.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's\n",
      "But I, I thought it was up there.\n",
      "So, that's interesting because New Hampshire, and parts of Vermont, um, they showed pictures of, of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Um.\n",
      "Um, you kind of think it's something else then?\n",
      "Well, that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article.\n",
      "So that,\n",
      "Oh, they didn't say, they didn't say what though,\n",
      "they just said they thought it was,\n",
      "They didn't say what,\n",
      "they just said they thought acid rain's contribution may be less than was previously suspected. Um, that it may be other natural things at work. Um,\n",
      "Uh, natural disease,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "so it's, it's less than clear.\n",
      "Like I said, I don't remember the article that well.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "But, um, I don't know,\n",
      "I mean, what do you think we can, uh, I guess as individuals or as a group, do about, uh, air pollution?\n",
      "Uh, we can demand, uh, more efficient automobiles for one thing.\n",
      "I still think that's, that's, uh, one of our major causes of pollutants.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, how we go about that, it's uh, uh, it's a little bit difficult.\n",
      "I think it's up to individuals too, to ask automakers for, for less pollutant vehicles.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "you I think you need a, a vehicle something like, uh, Ralph Nader, Nader's Raiders, or, where, uh, or, uh, uh, A A R P, which has a lot of members. Uh, if you can get those types of groups.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem.\n",
      "I mean, I remember reading an article that said like, it's, uh, the older polluters,\n",
      "the, the twelve and fifteen year old cars, you know, contribute like ninety percent, of the automobile pollution\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and the new cars it's hardly is, hardly anything.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they're better,\n",
      "but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there.\n",
      "Uh, when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch, smoke, or, uh,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune.\n",
      "Uh, I'm not really sure.\n",
      "You think that, that, that the, uh, the trucking industry is that, uh, incompetent, that they wouldn't, you know,\n",
      "fuel is, is one of their biggest costs.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, you would,\n",
      "But diesel engines.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "diesel engines.\n",
      "It, you know, it's, it,\n",
      "I mean, they do generate a lot of soot\n",
      "but that at least, that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "We could also, uh, push for legislation for, uh, rapid transit systems.\n",
      "This country seems to be a little behind on that.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "On the other hand most people don't use rapid transit because it's so inconvenient.\n",
      "Um, yeah,\n",
      "but only because we got used to, uh, single person, single car, driving.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "A lot of people don't even like to carpool.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But we could that.\n",
      "That'll help, pollution, air pollution,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "The, uh, United States and Canada are I guess, is, is, going into, uh, some types of agreements to limit, uh, what's being given out by power plants,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I guess Canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "sure.\n",
      "So that's helping.\n",
      "Well, what do you think about like a device, a meter right on a tail pipe\n",
      "and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted?\n",
      "Now that's an idea.\n",
      "don't say that too loud though because, uh, every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue,\n",
      "Well, it just means if you don't pollute, right, or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax\n",
      "or you just buy one of these things\n",
      "and it, it, uh,\n",
      "maybe you, you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe\n",
      "and, uh, the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts\n",
      "and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe\n",
      "and you couldn't start your car anymore.\n",
      "That's a, that's an interesting concept.\n",
      "Is that your idea?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but, uh, you know, it's, uh,\n",
      "I guess the difficulty would be to, that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again\n",
      "so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something.\n",
      "Well I was going to say,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "You could put it in, you could, you could, it could be installed like a catalytic converter.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I mean I guess you could take those off too\n",
      "but,\n",
      "You could take\n",
      "but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "if you can take a muffler off and only replace,\n",
      "well not unless it was built into every muffler.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And that's .\n",
      "But if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that, uh, busses and any kind of vehicle, had to pay a pollution tax, uh, this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters,\n",
      "That's a, that's quite a concept.\n",
      "You should, uh, pursue that I think, or patent it, you know.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "patent it,\n",
      "that's a good idea.\n",
      "If you could come up with a device that's the thing.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "But it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that.\n",
      "But that's a, that's a thought.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "you're right\n",
      "and that will solve, uh, a lot of problems.\n",
      "I don't know if you, uh, if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, but you know a proposal to, uh, uh, I guess the proper authorities,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "well you might, uh, generate some\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "the automobile regulatory agencies or something.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "you might generate some interest in it.\n",
      "But that's, that's a good idea.\n",
      "Other than that I'm not sure what, what individuals can do other than like I said get involved through a group or an organization.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "What are your music interests?\n",
      "Uh, just about any kind of music except acid rock\n",
      "I, I don't care, for acid rock,\n",
      "Me, too.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "but, uh, I grew up with country and western,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I did, too,\n",
      "but, uh,\n",
      "and then,\n",
      "just about any kind of music.\n",
      "I even like classical music.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh, I'm pretty diversified, too.\n",
      "I, I don't, I don't like acid rock either.\n",
      "I, I grew up in a small town\n",
      "so, uh, the only, we only had one radio station\n",
      "so it was country music,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but then, uh, when I,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I grew up with Hank Snow, and Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams and all of those old country and western songs.\n",
      "Oh, really.\n",
      "You're older than I am\n",
      "But, uh, I,\n",
      "did you happen to see last night the special on Channel Two with James Galway?\n",
      "We don't get Channel Two.\n",
      "My, uh, our cable doesn't,\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "I wish we got that what,\n",
      "but,\n",
      "That is fabulous.\n",
      "Was it?\n",
      "Well, we don't get Channel Two.\n",
      "We,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "when he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought, tears to your eyes, because he can make that flute sing.\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and, uh, it was tremendous.\n",
      "Now, he, he is a, uh,\n",
      "actually, I did,\n",
      "I played flute for, almost ten years\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and, and, uh, so, I, I, I appreciate his too, his, his\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "he, he, he's from Ireland isn't he?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh-huh,\n",
      "and it was, uh, mostly all Irish tunes,\n",
      "Was\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "they had a band with him that, uh, had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the, uh, tin whistle, and a couple of violins and, uh, drum,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they, they played all the Irish jigs and so forth,\n",
      "it was just fabulous.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, he, he is really good.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, I, I come from a musical background,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "so, uh, uh, I've played flute, flute and piano,\n",
      "so, I, I, I have a big appreciation for music, up to a point.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I, I'm getting now to the age where I don't like the new stuff that's coming and much of the new stuff that's coming out,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "my husband says I'm getting old\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "I love, uh, I, I especially like instrumentals.\n",
      "Do you?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I love to just lay back on the couch and, and turn a good, good instrumental got on and just close my eyes and listen.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's, that's nice to do, that is.\n",
      "I've got a, I've got a, I've got a two year old who's now getting,\n",
      "I'm getting well versed in, in kiddy music\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm, I've never played an instrument in my life,\n",
      "I've always wanted too,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something,\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "but, uh,\n",
      "I was one of the forced ones\n",
      "but I, I'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music\n",
      "Oh, I could never do that\n",
      "and,\n",
      "I was never that brave\n",
      "but, uh, yeah.\n",
      "I guess the closest I've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "oh, yeah,\n",
      "I've, I've done, I've done that at church too.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I haven't done that in a long time.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So, let's see\n",
      "what .\n",
      "Well, what kind of music do you not like?\n",
      "Well, like I say the acid rock,\n",
      "I just do not\n",
      "an I don't care for rap music either.\n",
      "Oh,\n",
      "that's not music\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "no.\n",
      "that is not,\n",
      "I don't know what that is,\n",
      "but that's not music\n",
      "If I can't understand the words I don't want to listen to it.\n",
      "Well, it's, it's, it's not, it's not music,\n",
      "it's just, it's just, uh, uh, talking in a beat,\n",
      "it is just, it's not exciting at all\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "it doesn't, it doesn't give you relaxation,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "you can't dance to it,\n",
      "you can't do anything to it\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "But, I, and I love, I like orchestra music too. Like the, Boston Pops or, or anything.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Have you ever been to the, to, to the Dallas Symphony?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Have you?\n",
      "Is\n",
      "are, are they good?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they're good.\n",
      "Are they?\n",
      "I, I have, I have, never been.\n",
      "And, uh, we went and saw, uh, LES MISERABLES\n",
      "Oh, really?\n",
      "oh, the music in that was fantastic.\n",
      "I, I've heard, I've heard that that is a really,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I heard that was hard to get tickets to.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it, it, uh,\n",
      "I can't remember how far in advance we reserved, tickets\n",
      "but it was out, you know, out at the State Fair Music Hall\n",
      "and, uh it was well worth the price.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that was a real,\n",
      "Was it?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I, I bet it was,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I, I really bet it was\n",
      "Is that the only, uh, musical,\n",
      "do you go see a lot of musicals?\n",
      "Just, just ever so often you know, a real, a real good one like that one\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and,\n",
      "That, that would be, that would be nice\n",
      "I went and saw, uh, I think it was, uh, SUGAR BABIES,\n",
      "that was good,\n",
      "that had good music in it.\n",
      "Was it?\n",
      "How, how,\n",
      "I can't, I don't know what that's about.\n",
      "Uh, that was the one with Mickey Rooney\n",
      "and, uh, oh, what's that real, oh, not real old, my wife she is old too, dancer, uh,\n",
      "I can't think of her name.\n",
      "I got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it, Helen something.\n",
      "Uh, uh, uh, I think I know who you're oh, I know who you're talking about,\n",
      "real long legs, and dark hair.\n",
      "she's got black hair,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "okay,\n",
      "I know who your talking about.\n",
      "I can't think ever her name either.\n",
      "I can't think of it.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that that was, that was,\n",
      "I remember that being, uh, here a few years ago.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but, uh,\n",
      "Oh, oh, the last country music,\n",
      "my, my parents still, uh, really like country, music\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and they, they like, uh, they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Statler Brothers,\n",
      "Oh, yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "and, and, uh, well, my, my, my, my parents,\n",
      "The Blackwoods.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "my husband likes, uh, country music real well\n",
      "and he, he likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and, yeah,\n",
      "he really likes Shenandoah.\n",
      "Alabama.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "well, yeah,\n",
      "Alabama,\n",
      "Uh,\n",
      "I think, I think they're a bit over exposed\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "I get kind, of get tired of every other song being Alabama on the, radio.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "either Alabama or Hank Williams, Junior.\n",
      "Oh, I, I've never cared for Hank, Williams, Junior.\n",
      "I never have either,\n",
      "and I never have figured out how he won, uh, entertainer of the year for about, three or four years in a row.\n",
      "Oh\n",
      "Oh, we, we watch those award shows too,\n",
      "we enjoy watching the country and the Grammies and stuff\n",
      "but I just, I just don't care for him,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I just never have.\n",
      "I don't,\n",
      "I guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is, uh, probably Eddy Arnold.\n",
      "Is, is it?\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "I, I think, I, I know who that is,\n",
      "uh-huh.\n",
      "I think my parents have have, uh, some of his records.\n",
      "But, uh, I got a, I've got about a hundred and, or had a, uh, some, uh, I sold some of them, I had about a hundred and fifty old seventy-eight R P M records of country and western, songs,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Smiley Burnette, I don't know if you were old enough to remember him him.\n",
      "I've heard the name.\n",
      "He was, uh, played in the old western movies.\n",
      "He was the sidekick of Gene Autry I believe\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "or they,\n",
      "I think his name in, in the movie was Froggy\n",
      "and,\n",
      "I've, I've never seen a Gene Autry movie,\n",
      "had a real raspy voice,\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "and, uh,\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I never have\n",
      "some of those old ones, of course, Bob Wills, Miss Texas Playboys Ernest Tubbs and Red Foley an,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "those go back quite a way\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I took them up here to Collectors Records and was able to get a little money for them\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but, uh, my mother and dad use to, uh, own a restaurant,\n",
      "It's hard to,\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "and he had, uh, they had a, uh, nickelodeon, of course, in the restaurant,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and when they would come and change the records the guys would, the guy would give her the old records\n",
      "Well, that\n",
      "that's neat.\n",
      "so, that's where I got my,\n",
      "that would be great if they weren't too worn out, at the time.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Of course, there's not a whole lot of market for seventy-eight R P M records.\n",
      "Is there not?\n",
      "You, you'd, well you'd think there would be.\n",
      "Well, the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because, you have to have that needle, that, uh, particular kind of needle\n",
      "Well, that's true.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "and, uh, they, just won't play on a modern day, uh phonograph.\n",
      "Well, that's a shame\n",
      "because I, I, we go to antique stores a lot\n",
      "and you see seventy-eights, a, a lot at, at the stores, at record stores,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "you'd, think there'd be a market for,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm, I'm sure you could find old players for them\n",
      "but that would cost a fortune, if you could find them that worked\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Of course, they, you know, just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because, you, you get that scratchy sound.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, those things were big and thick weren't they?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "You could kill somebody with them\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "warped real easy.\n",
      "And the ones you buy,\n",
      "go out and buy one now\n",
      "and they're just so thin and, flimsy\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and they just, they're not meant to last, at all,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "neither are tapes.\n",
      "I, I we buy cassette tapes,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and machines will eat them,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and so, the best bet, any, these days are compact disk,\n",
      "those things are practically indestructible\n",
      "But, I, I guess, you know, the old country and western music you,\n",
      "back then when I was a kid, there wasn't that much T V,\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "so that's all you had to listen to was the, radio,\n",
      "Radio.\n",
      "and, uh,\n",
      "that's just what, just what you had,\n",
      "plus,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I think it was better back then to,\n",
      "there's too much T V now\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and the radio is, you know, more exciting, really, than, than television,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "your imagination\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "kept\n",
      "and\n",
      "it just didn't vegetate your mind like television does\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opera.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Was it on the radio every week?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "what day, what day was that on,\n",
      "do you, can you recall.\n",
      "Uh, uh, seems like it was on a Friday,\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "Friday or,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well what do you think about the idea of, uh, kids having to do public service work for a year?\n",
      "Do you think it's a\n",
      "Well, I, I think it's a pretty good idea.\n",
      "I think they should either do that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or helping elderly people.\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "yes,\n",
      "I, I, you know, I think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help\n",
      "and I think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and, and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home\n",
      "and I'm not sure that that's not a bad idea\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "and, or the military for a year or two, wouldn't be bad for,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I think it teaches kids how to grow.\n",
      "How about yourself?\n",
      "Uh, I agree with you.\n",
      "Uh, uh, what I'm thinking about is back well, when I was a kid, and much earlier than that, kids were kind of,\n",
      "you know, the parents kind of pushed them to join, like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts\n",
      "and they did, do, do do a lot of public service activities,\n",
      "but these days they're not, uh,\n",
      "parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that.\n",
      "Because when I was in the Girl Scouts, we did a lot of public service things, because that's just part of, of the scouting, and, you know.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I've, I've,\n",
      "that's really great.\n",
      "I, I really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent, two excellent organizations.\n",
      "They are\n",
      "but parents,\n",
      "You know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they do.\n",
      "and they don't follow it at all, you know.\n",
      "There are very few Scouts go on, and become Eagle Scouts.\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "And, and I don't know what the high rank is for the gals\n",
      "but,\n",
      "I, I, uh,\n",
      "senior.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Senior,\n",
      "okay.\n",
      "So, there's not, uh,\n",
      "Oh, they're just not,\n",
      "once they get into junior high it just, not done anymore\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they, they lose interest.\n",
      "and then when they young, young adults, there's even less interest there.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "They're more for, I\n",
      "Me\n",
      "Not, not,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Grab,\n",
      "grab,\n",
      "grab,\n",
      "walk out\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "you're absolutely right\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "I think it's a really a good thing.\n",
      "I, I like to see,\n",
      "of course, there's, you know, third world countries that can use all kind of help\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country, too.\n",
      "But I think, we ought to start right here at home.\n",
      "I'm, you know,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh, I'm not, I'm not so sure that overseas help, helping overseas would be such a hot idea for, for, uh, a lot of young people.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "it, it,\n",
      "But, since there is much that needs to be done here.\n",
      "I think that, yeah, I think that we need to really address what we've done here\n",
      "and, and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Well, it's been really good.\n",
      "We talked about this for a few minutes,\n",
      "and, uh, hopefully, we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday,\n",
      "but I, I don't really have too much more to say on this topic, I guess.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I, I agree with you\n",
      "It, we, I guess we both agree that it's a good thing, that they should do sometime.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well you take care,\n",
      "and, and, enjoy the day.\n",
      "You, too.\n",
      "You, too.\n",
      "Thank you, ma'am.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Bye-bye.\n",
      "Do are you on a regular exercise program right now?\n",
      "Yes,\n",
      "and I hate it\n",
      "How about you?\n",
      "Oh, well, I'm kind of off and on.\n",
      "Off and on\n",
      "well, I guess I've been kind of off and on\n",
      "I've, uh, Had some health problems that have led me to, uh,\n",
      "Right now I'm kind of off.\n",
      "I'd say more on than off\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "what type of exercise do you do?\n",
      "Uh, I do walking on the treadmill,\n",
      "and then I do low impact aerobics.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I guess you don't enjoy that very much.\n",
      "Not, not really.\n",
      "Do you find that, uh, to be boring?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and time consuming,\n",
      "I mean it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming,\n",
      "it's, uh, you know, afterwards, you know,\n",
      "then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up, you know.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, I'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "But I,\n",
      "Do you go through this, is this something that you go through every year\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I haven't decided whether, whether I want to play yet or not\n",
      "I just bought myself a solo flex machine,\n",
      "I don't know if you've seen those advertised on T V.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's one of those, uh, universal type machines, exercise machines.\n",
      "But I haven't really sat down and used it match yet,\n",
      "so it's collecting dust right now.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "a lot of things do that.\n",
      "I had an, I had an exercise bike\n",
      "I used to jog somewhat.\n",
      "I use to have one,\n",
      "and I finally got rid of sit cause I never used it,\n",
      "but I do use my treadmill\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "well, that's good.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "my parents have a treadmill\n",
      "it's,\n",
      "when I go visit them, uh, I get on that thing every now and then.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't, you don't have any excuse.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "I just got the bicycle out today,\n",
      "and it was real nice outside,\n",
      "had to get out to do something.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I can't ride a bike\n",
      "so.\n",
      "I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold\n",
      "so thought I, better, better get outside and do something and not waist the day.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's too nice,\n",
      "it's been too nice all weekend.\n",
      "But, uh, yeah,\n",
      "I need to start jog something again.\n",
      "I've always of that to be, uh, really one of the best forms of exercise,\n",
      "but it's terribly boring,\n",
      "and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently.\n",
      "Have you ever had any injuries from jogging?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I never have.\n",
      "Well, I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries\n",
      "I usually only go about a mile or two.\n",
      "I guess it worries me about jogging it's that I hear that it's very hard on your body and, and that, you know, you can end up getting hurt, worse.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's, it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete, or on asphalt.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Suppose to be much better if you find grass, uh, or, or dirt to jog on.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's not quite so so easy.\n",
      "You have to have the right, type of shoes too,\n",
      "that's, very important.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I found that, true especially from walking on toe and fronts .\n",
      "But,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often\n",
      "my don't get very much use\n",
      "Well, I guess my breakdown about, they say about every six months.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I usually enjoy the exercise I do\n",
      "but, uh, like I said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining a, a program.\n",
      "So I'll, I'll bicycle\n",
      "I get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, uh, on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile,\n",
      "but then I'll get tired of doing that, and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week.\n",
      "But, uh, that gets old too in a very short order,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I'm, I'm hoping that this, uh, solo flex will, uh, uh, change things a little bit,\n",
      "I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, don't let it collect dust.\n",
      "At least exercise while dusting it off\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "well.\n",
      "Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can, uh, start some type of, uh, regular program.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that, that'll be good.\n",
      "I've always found that, uh, when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep, uh, keep something going.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, when I was in high school we had a choice of, uh, taking, uh, physical education courses on exercise,\n",
      "an, uh, one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine, lifting weights and, uh, working out like that.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And that was very helpful\n",
      "we kept charts of our progress, and, uh, consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I found that to be, uh, very helpful.\n",
      "Are you going to do that?\n",
      "Uh, I need to,\n",
      "I haven't started yet\n",
      "but, uh, it's a thought.\n",
      "Well, that sounds like something good to do then.\n",
      "Sounds like something I should do.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "nice way to start off this spring. Get back in shape.\n",
      "How often do you, uh, uh, go out each week on your walking?\n",
      "Well, I do,\n",
      "I switch every other day\n",
      "one day I walk\n",
      "and one day I do the aerobics.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "how far, about how far do you go walking?\n",
      "Well, I'm trying to get my tolerance now\n",
      "I just had surgery, um, less then two months ago,\n",
      "and right now I'm just a little over about a mile and a half,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "but I'm trying to workup to three miles.\n",
      "Well, that's good.\n",
      "Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "It,\n",
      "it takes, it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "but.\n",
      "Well, if you keep up with a consistent pace just to, uh, keep the heart rating going, uh,\n",
      "My walkman broke,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "so I'm upset\n",
      "and I just have to turn to stereo up real loud\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it is\n",
      "and this doesn't, you know,\n",
      "my treadmill has an incline\n",
      "and, you know, you can get a really good workout on it.\n",
      "Um, do you go to an aerobics class\n",
      "or do you watch, on T V?\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I, I just do it on T V,\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "I have a cassette.\n",
      "Which, uh, shows do you watch on T V?\n",
      "Um, it's a, it's a\n",
      "I use tapes.\n",
      "Oh, okay,\n",
      "okay,\n",
      "like a Cathy Smith workout,\n",
      "Or, or Richard Simmons,\n",
      "or Jane Fonda.\n",
      "Okay\n",
      "Sweating to the oldies\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I, every now and then I'll watch E S P N,\n",
      "I get cable on T V,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and they have, uh, a couple of shows called basic training,\n",
      "and, uh, what is the other one called.\n",
      "There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N,\n",
      "I don't know if he's still on any more or not,\n",
      "I I don't know if I get E S P N or not\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, uh, one, you know,\n",
      "I use to watch one, watch one on the air,\n",
      "but that was back,\n",
      "BODIES IN MOTION that's, that's the name of the one I was thinking of. With Gill.\n",
      "That's was,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I watched that cause he was cute\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "he's not bad\n",
      "his assistants usually aren't either.\n",
      "But, uh,\n",
      "They're always in, in Hawaii some place. On, on the beach.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "But then that was back when, uh, you know, the high impact and,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, they, they do low I pact stuff now,\n",
      "Do they.\n",
      "Are\n",
      "yeah\n",
      "they're still, they're still, he's still doing it then, uh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "every morning.\n",
      "I'll have to tune in.\n",
      "It's on E S P N, uh,\n",
      "at what time,\n",
      "I can't remember what time.\n",
      "It's, uh, you know,\n",
      "I can't remember offhand what time.\n",
      "I'll have to check it, check, check, check it back up,\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "and, but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show, at least on\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "every now and then.\n",
      "Not everybody has a picture perfect body.\n",
      "Uh-huh,\n",
      "well, I found that they, they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on T V.\n",
      "I haven't watch any other ones on T V. watch=watched Just on some of the tapes.\n",
      "They're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day. Monday through Friday incase you're interested in that.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "thanks.\n",
      "but, uh, I haven't done so much as, uh, watch the tape that I made.\n",
      "Now, that's a thought.\n",
      "So I'm kind of bad about that myself.\n",
      "Well, that's thought,\n",
      "I haven't thought about that,\n",
      "well they're going to beep us pretty soon.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "well, I sure enjoyed, to you about exercise and fitness.\n",
      "Nice talking to you too.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "thanks.\n",
      "So, all right.\n",
      "Talk to you later.\n",
      "Good night.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "Uh, well what would you say your opinion is on gun control?\n",
      "Well, I don't know.\n",
      "I've, I've had mixed emotions, I guess, when I listen to, uh, the radio and, and watch T V about the different, uh, things that are happening.\n",
      "Uh, I'm against it\n",
      "but on the same token, uh, I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right to do that\n",
      "So I, I have a rifle in the house.\n",
      "Uh, the ammunition is probably so old I'm afraid to use it.\n",
      "But, uh, I bought it for target practicing and, uh, and also because I wanted a weapon.\n",
      "Uh, how do you feel about it?\n",
      "Well, I think, uh, down here in Texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "And, I think they need that.\n",
      "Uh, and I do have a, I have a pistol.\n",
      "It's a little twenty-two\n",
      "and I have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "you know, I do like to have my guns.\n",
      "Uh, I don't know if I'll ever use it, you know.\n",
      "And like you, my bullets to my little pistol's probably, uh, about three years old\n",
      "Uh, my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But, uh, I like to have them where handy.\n",
      "Well, up, uh, up in New England where I'm from, uh, you had to get a permit before you could buy any ammunition.\n",
      "And I thought that was really good.\n",
      "And I think if they, uh,\n",
      "takes two weeks for that system to process, uh, your request for, uh, not as a gun permit but, uh, but to buy ammunition.\n",
      "You have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that.\n",
      "I've never heard of anything like that.\n",
      "Yeah. Uh,\n",
      "That would be nice.\n",
      "But,  you know,\n",
      "the criminals that are going to get their guns one  way or the other.\n",
      "I  I, I agree.\n",
      "I think, you know, one of the things that, that, that needs to happen is, uh, to, to stop the impulse buyer from, uh, buying it quickly and, and, uh, maybe putting a week's waiting period or something on it.\n",
      "But if someone's really determined to, to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "And you can get them really cheap.\n",
      "I know\n",
      "I, I had a waiting period on my pistol because I was down in, uh, Tennessee. And, uh, they had a waiting period\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, we bought it there.\n",
      "And,\n",
      "How long was the waiting period out there?\n",
      "About nine days.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "That wasn't too, too bad.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No\n",
      "Because if, if you're going to go buy something, uh, uh, of that nature, I think you, you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it.\n",
      "You're not going to react that quickly.\n",
      "In other words, you know, you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day.\n",
      "somebody wants to do that,\n",
      "I, I, at times I think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I do too. Uh, because it doesn't make any difference, uh, uh, whether it's a pistol or a shotgun, I suppose.\n",
      "They both do the same kind of job.\n",
      "A shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does.\n",
      "Uh, yeah.\n",
      "I suppose.\n",
      "I never got shot with either one.\n",
      "But I don't know, uh,\n",
      "I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun\n",
      "No,\n",
      "a shotgun's got too much of a spread.\n",
      "Or at  least ours does.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, it's, you know,\n",
      "you have a little, uh, thing on the bottom of on top of the barrel where you, you turn it,\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "And the spread changes.\n",
      "Uh, I've got a manual single shot\n",
      "and I guess it doesn't have any, any automatic features to it.\n",
      "The further away I get, the, the, uh, wider the shot gets from the target.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And the closer that I get, the tighter that it gets.\n",
      "It's got a hell of a kick to it.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "My husband had a, uh, a police gun at one time.\n",
      "And I shot that thing one time.\n",
      "Almost knocked me down.\n",
      "And it just a\n",
      "I I forget,\n",
      "I think it was a three fifty-seven.\n",
      "I'm not sure.\n",
      "Do you belong to a gun club or you?\n",
      "He belonged to one awhile back.\n",
      "Uh, since we moved,\n",
      "we've only been here in Texas for about a year\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and, uh, we can't even find a place to shoot. Just for  target practice.\n",
      "No kidding.\n",
      "I'd love to get used to that shotgun.\n",
      "We traded his pistol for that shotgun.\n",
      "Huh. Well the, the, uh, clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive\n",
      "but, uh, it's well worth it.\n",
      "You can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have, uh, competition.\n",
      "Uh, I've never really joined a club because I haven't got the time. Not because I haven't got the desire.\n",
      "Uh, there's an annual membership fee, uh, that's, that's fairly high.\n",
      "Plus there's an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time, uh, uh, member.\n",
      "So the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club.\n",
      "Plus you have to pay for the, the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, that's what my husband,\n",
      "when he was in that gun club where he was doing that tell if it's a cough or something was\n",
      "It, you know,\n",
      "he went mostly just to, uh, shoot at paper targets.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Uh, but, you know, they used speed and accuracy and all that.\n",
      "I think that, that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose.\n",
      "In fact, I'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to, uh, show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon.\n",
      "That's a good,\n",
      "I've never thought of that.\n",
      "That's a good point.\n",
      "And, you know, it, it,\n",
      "even after you wait your nine days, if you don't know how to handle it, it's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive.\n",
      "And you give him a license because he waited nine days.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's,\n",
      "and, yeah.\n",
      "He could, he could not only, uh, uh, shoot himself.\n",
      "He could, he could, uh, mishandle a weapon. Leave it at home and let a child get at it.\n",
      "It,\n",
      "well we, uh, we was living on a navy base down in Memphis\n",
      "and, uh, this one guy decided to play, uh, lonesome cowboy or something.\n",
      "And he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "He was fortunate.\n",
      "He could, he could of hit something else\n",
      "Well, he went tumbling down the steps along with, uh, shooting his foot almost off.\n",
      "He broke his leg and collar bone and a couple of other things I'm sure, being,  Mister Cowboy.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "I can't remember what the the term was going around.\n",
      "It was about four or five years ago.\n",
      "But. Now, I guess that would be a good idea\n",
      "About, uh, private citizens selling a weapons?\n",
      "Like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me.\n",
      "How do you feel about that?\n",
      "Do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the, uh, buyer and the seller?\n",
      "And, or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system, uh, because you own it?\n",
      "Uh, that's a hard one because we did that.\n",
      "But, uh, I think there ought to be some rule against it.\n",
      "I'll, uh, you know,\n",
      "the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something, the cops are going to come to you.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "isn't  there a way to, uh, to deregister yourself after you register a gun?\n",
      "Uh,\n",
      "I have no idea.\n",
      "I've only  had one gun\n",
      "Because I   have,\n",
      "and I've kept it, you  know, the one gun that was in my name.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Is it registered?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "The, uh, the rifle that I've got is not registered,\n",
      "and, uh, I don't know why I never registered it\n",
      "but the, uh,\n",
      "I don't think you have to register a shotgun\n",
      "Um, I, I think it's, it's voluntary\n",
      "The, uh, the,\n",
      "Well, see, uh, my husband has a thing.\n",
      "If they go to, uh, regulating, uh, all right, uh, banning guns. private citizens\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "this,\n",
      "my kid is jumping on me.\n",
      "I can't hardly talk.\n",
      "My husband feels that they'll come and collect everybody's guns.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I guess that could happen.\n",
      "It's just like the, uh, the social security system\n",
      "Once they, uh, they gave everybody a number\n",
      "and now they're making you, uh, uh, get one at, at birth.\n",
      "And  once they have your number, they have your identification.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And if you try to do anything, uh, like, uh, not identify yourself to the government, they know who you are.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And everything about you.\n",
      "And , that's true\n",
      "Uh, I,\n",
      "you know, they know so, how much money you make a week to, uh, probably your, uh,\n",
      "my kid is banging.\n",
      "I was seeing what they was banging on.\n",
      "Uh, I've lost my train of thought.\n",
      "I'm sorry\n",
      "That's all right.\n",
      "You, you were talking about, uh, uh, what the Federal government knows about people.\n",
      "Oh, the\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "They, they probably know everything from, half the time what time you go to the bathroom.\n",
      "They probably do.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "that's that's a little bit extreme.\n",
      "But they could know anything and everything about you.\n",
      "And, uh, I'd like to have my gun.\n",
      "If they go to banding, banning them, I'd lose my gun\n",
      "but we wouldn't lose our our, uh, shotgun.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, uh, we're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "But I don't, I don't, uh\n",
      "Do you find it difficult picking up, uh, guns that, that are not registered?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "I don't either.\n",
      "I can, I can buy some, uh, today if I wanted to.\n",
      "Just  you know, put up the money.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, you can look in the, uh, the,\n",
      "we got a thing down here called A SHOPPER.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "It's a, a it's a, it's a bargain thing.\n",
      "Uh, you go and you know, always see guns in there. Five to seven guns a day.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "It comes out every Tuesday.\n",
      "And there's, there's no waiting period on that.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "None whatsoever\n",
      "You call,\n",
      "we sold a refrigerator through it\n",
      "and it took us all of twelve hours.\n",
      "To sell the refrigerator?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You know. And I'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun.\n",
      "Huh. And I think the Federal government is, uh, is really far away from, uh, uh, control.\n",
      "I, I don't believe in, uh,\n",
      "I'm I shouldn't probably say control.\n",
      "I mean regulation.\n",
      "Control is something that I wouldn't want the Federal government to have.\n",
      "Uh, but I would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, I agree with you there.\n",
      "They do have too much control over us already.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh, we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have.\n",
      "Unfortunately, we, uh, we vote for the, the people who spend the money,\n",
      "so I can't complain too much.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I guess so.\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "They're\n",
      "Well, I haven't heard anything about the proposal myself,\n",
      "but, uh, Uh, I don't know if its their proposal or one that's being seriously kicked around.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I haven't either.\n",
      "I've, I've always felt for a long time that I, I think that all young kids ought to do a stint, uh, primarily in the military.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh.\n",
      "Most countries require that now,\n",
      "they you know, they have, uh, it mandatory for, for the, the uh at least the young men,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I don't know about the young women,\n",
      "I don't know if they have to serve in the military,  too.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "a lot,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "well, you take Israel\n",
      "I mean, everybody does.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I don't think it's a bad idea,\n",
      "teaches, teaches a lot.\n",
      "I mean, I went in the service when I was eighteen, And, uh, stayed in for ten years.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "Is that right?\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh, did a lot of growing up.\n",
      "I bet.\n",
      "You have to.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "my father had been in the military.\n",
      "I didn't do it myself.\n",
      "My father had\n",
      "and that's, uh, how he put himself through school basically.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "He came from a poor immigrant family,\n",
      "and he didn't have a chance to, uh, you know,\n",
      "the family wasn't wealthy,\n",
      "so he had to do something to,  put himself through school,\n",
      "Do it himself.\n",
      "and he did.\n",
      "And he was very successful.\n",
      "Well, my parents wanted to send me to college,\n",
      "and I was dead set against it\n",
      "You know, I had wanderlust, you know.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And I got in,\n",
      "and after, after wasting the first six years, partying and everything else, I decided, uh-huh, time to settle down and do something.\n",
      "So I started to work on my education.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Course my job was such that I didn't, I couldn't do it as much as I wanted\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "and still I ended up going two semesters when I got out just to get my degree.\n",
      "That's pretty good.\n",
      "But, I've been in school ever since\n",
      "That's good.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I guess.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's, uh,\n",
      "I don't know.\n",
      "There's other kinds of service to the country that could be done, you know,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I mean if you don't like,\n",
      "I mean, working in the national parks, Uh, working, clean up the roadsides\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "I mean, I've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time, *why no slash? not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job, but at least some of their time to look for, to go out and clean up the roads. You know,\n",
      "Oh yeah, Absolutely.\n",
      "I mean,\n",
      "All these, all this money that we're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we're paying all these welfare recipients,\n",
      "and if they're able-bodied people, I don't see any problem at all with having them go out there and, and, if nothing else, get a group of them together and take them around to old folks  places and let them cut the yards, paint the houses.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we'd learn service to other people   in this country.\n",
      "Sure ,\n",
      "sure.\n",
      "So I'm,\n",
      "get something out of that money.\n",
      "Country would benefit,\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "I've,\n",
      "I mean, uh,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "my next door neighbor when I was growing up, worked for the unemployment division,\n",
      "and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able-bodied\n",
      "and,\n",
      "That right.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and he, he had all kinds of horror stories.\n",
      "You know, these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks,\n",
      "and, back, back in those days they also use to give you, uh, booklets good for, uh, clothing and gas, and things like this\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "They get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games you know,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "and I'm, I I have a hard time dealing with that.\n",
      "What I hear one time, I think it was on Paul Harvey's, uh, radio segment, that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy, each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "I mean, I was astounded.\n",
      "I don't even make that.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "I, you, you think about, you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and somebody's taking that away.\n",
      "and, and there's probably, there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "no doubt.\n",
      "You know, it's, it's, it's totally ridiculous,\n",
      "and now, I, I, I, uh, started out when I first got in graduate school\n",
      "I was going into public administration,\n",
      "and, uh, quite honestly I just got so fed up with it I just couldn't stand it any more.\n",
      "Is that right,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I mean, this is the kind of thing you look at.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You sit there\n",
      "and when you're writing up budgets, you wonder, okay, how much money do we need.\n",
      "Well, you need X number dollars for the recipients\n",
      "but you need X number dollars to administer the program.\n",
      "Well just ridiculous.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "This is ridiculous.\n",
      "It's sad.\n",
      "It is,\n",
      "it's pathetic.\n",
      "I mean, there's got to be a different way.\n",
      "There's got to be a better way.\n",
      "But it'll never happen.\n",
      "I mean, these these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "What would happen if the required young people to do service to the country,\n",
      "what should they get in return, I wonder.\n",
      "Like, uh,\n",
      "I think, I think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as, uh,\n",
      "and I would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Give an incentive.\n",
      "Educational or vocational training or something.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Something that's going to help them along the way.\n",
      "And they'll help the country eventually, too, because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people,\n",
      "Sure,\n",
      "I mean,\n",
      "Well, this,\n",
      "I mean I mean, look at the statistics,\n",
      "and that's only going to help.\n",
      "I mean, it's sad.\n",
      "One in five Americans can't read\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "adults, that is, can't even read.\n",
      "And, and we've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean, what are we, what are we becoming?\n",
      "We're becoming a service country.\n",
      "As opposed to what we were twenty years ago.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we were an industrial giant,\n",
      "and now we're we're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game.\n",
      "We taught them how to do it,\n",
      "and they, they did it better than we do.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "Simple as that.\n",
      "because they have the ambition, I guess.\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "simple as that.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "which is good for them,\n",
      "but on the other hand, we kind of lose out.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's terrible for us.\n",
      "I think that if, uh, young people had service to the country might give them more ambition. Because they learn that serving other people is a good thing.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and, and it can be good for them, too.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "oh yeah.\n",
      "I mean, even, even the greedy kids that we've got now ...\n",
      "Oh god, you go to the mall\n",
      "and you see, you know, fourteen year old kids flaunting money, because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night, you know\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "for what.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Give me the money\n",
      "and I'll, I'll teach them something good\n",
      "Well, you know, you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "uh, that's my other complaint.\n",
      "Parents aren't parents any more.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "They've, they've relinquished their parenting.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "One of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Well, as a substitute teacher for a year, I, I can say yes.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I mean, I talked with somebody else about that another time,\n",
      "and, you know, when I's in graduate school working on my master's degree in math, I was, uh, teaching as part of my, part of the program.\n",
      "And I just love teaching.\n",
      "That was a lot, that's probably the most fun I had.\n",
      "And, uh, it helped me out because I learned things and learned how to do things differently.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And when, uh, when come time to get out of school, I thought, Boy, I'd like to teach.\n",
      "But you know, for, for what.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You know, I don't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "I mean, that, that's a sad thing to think,\n",
      "and that's kind of selfish on my part,\n",
      "and I admit that,\n",
      "Well, in a way it is,\n",
      "but you have to look out for yourself you know,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "I mean, that's\n",
      "and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers,\n",
      "That's wrong.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "gosh,\n",
      "I mean,\n",
      "I'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less,\n",
      "I saying teachers should be paid more.\n",
      "No,\n",
      "I mean yeah.\n",
      "They do an absolutely necessary job,\n",
      "I mean, I, I have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But, uh, I mean, there's, there's a sense of priorities here, too.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You know, we need,\n",
      "what's more important, picking up the garbage or educating our kids.\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "They both have their place.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they, they,\n",
      "sure.\n",
      "But, you know, when it gets right down to it,\n",
      "I mean, one's\n",
      "I mean, on the other hand, I mean, you take a garbage man in New York City starts out at twenty-six thousand dollars.\n",
      "That's pretty good.\n",
      "Well I bet you there's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I mean, my other pet peeve is unions.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "oh yeah.\n",
      "You know, it's just, it's, it's ridiculous the way unions have gone.\n",
      "There was a time when unions were needed.\n",
      "And they served a good function.\n",
      "And they served a good function,\n",
      "but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated,\n",
      "and they're only there to perpetuate their own, their own power structure.\n",
      "I remember, the company my dad worked for, the people there went on strike against the management.\n",
      "It was a steel manufacturing place,\n",
      "and they, uh,\n",
      "this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap,\n",
      "and they were having a hard time.\n",
      "And they told the strikers there, look,\n",
      "we need you to come back and get this stuff done.\n",
      "Or else we're going to be out of business.\n",
      "And they wouldn't come back,\n",
      "so they went bankrupt.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And, and they all lost their jobs.\n",
      "Sure,\n",
      "and, and   and that's really what happened to the steel industry in this country.\n",
      "And it's like , you know.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "So many times, I mean, you had the, uh, the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time.\n",
      "And, well, that took care of that industry\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "and, and, then, and I'll tell you,\n",
      "Detroit worked awfully hard on, on stopping car manufacturing in this country.\n",
      "And they're trying to do that now with the imports.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I mean, you know, we've never caught up,\n",
      "and I don't think we ever will.\n",
      "It'll be a tough road, though.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I mean, here it is,\n",
      "and we've got, we've got to go into partnership with the Japanese to build cars.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You know And they only did it because they, I guess they were embarrassed that they're so good at it\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's about right.\n",
      "Gosh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "well, back to the original subject,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "I think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service,\n",
      "I don't care what kind it is.\n",
      "It teaches them pride in their country.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and pride in themselves, too.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "They could, they could, I mean, you could organize something just within your community. same old thing.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "I mean,\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "That's like Eagle Scouts.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Uh-huh.\n",
      "And that's a great idea.\n",
      "I think they ought to take them and, I don't know, just have sort of like a, a, a manpower pool and say Okay, look,\n",
      "we need somebody ...\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "we're going to talk about the public school system, What's wrong with it, an, or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it, what should be done about it.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Fantastic.\n",
      "Well one thing that pops into my mind real quick is, uh, about the, uh, funding of, the, the school system right now.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Evidently, uh, that's, that's a big problem.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's amazing, uh,\n",
      "I always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough, I mean, to be doing what they're doing, uh.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "When I was in college I, I enjoyed teaching,\n",
      "'cause I did some teaching part-time\n",
      "and I really enjoyed that\n",
      "but I wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high,\n",
      "it just, you know, all the problems.\n",
      "Oh, Lord, I mean, yeah,\n",
      "an, you talk about stress and pressure,\n",
      "I tell you what,\n",
      "it's, uh,\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "they're putting in fifty, sixty hours a week,\n",
      "I'm sure, because they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready.\n",
      "Do,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "And, you know, and they're being paid, probably half what most people being paid.\n",
      "Exactly,\n",
      "and,\n",
      "And we're paying basketball people, you know, millions of dollars a year for, for what, you know.\n",
      "That's right,\n",
      "and then they, uh, poof it off, you know, do like Tarpley.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "But, uh, I\n",
      "what gets me is I can't believe that Congress, uh, or, our state legislature can't come up with, uh, some kind of workable means to have funds for the school.\n",
      "You know, it's, uh,\n",
      "I just don't understand that.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "it's, uh.\n",
      "Now do you have little kids, or what?\n",
      "No, uh,\n",
      "sure don't,\n",
      "my wife and I've just been married about two years\n",
      "but I have a sister that's a, uh, school teacher,\n",
      "and, uh.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "my wife and I have a, a three year old, almost four and a, a two year old.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "So we're looking at the, the older one going to school next year. Not, not, well not this coming fall but the year after that.\n",
      "Okay,\n",
      "so it's getting close.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "he's going to be going to kindergarten,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, you know, we're, we're thinking about that.\n",
      "What's that going to be like.\n",
      "Are they going to be taught nothing,\n",
      "or they going be taught something,\n",
      "we're going to, we're going to be involved in our child's education.\n",
      "We're going to be teaching him what we can at home, of course, because, uh, I guess we don't trust the school system, which is very sad, uh,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "but. But if it doesn't start at home, it's not going to go anywhere. You know,\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "that's true.\n",
      "and we're going to try to teach him good values, because, you know, when, when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them, well hey, if you can play football or basketball that's what's important. Not if you can read or write, or do, or understand some science. You know,\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "I mean give me a break,\n",
      "that's, that's, that's bogus.\n",
      "Right,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "Well and, uh, you know, one thing my wife and I've talked about, are, uh, private schools. You know whether, uh, uh, we would want to invest in, in private schools as they're growing up, because, you know, just in the Dallas area, um, we're not real comfortable with the, with the public schools.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And Dallas, uh, school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "I couldn't believe that.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "You know, one, that's one reason we bought a house here in Plano.\n",
      "We were hoping, you know, well the school district's going to be good, you know, for resale value, and, so on and so forth,\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "but, uh, I can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "we talked, you talked about before, about the school funding.\n",
      "I think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which I don't think will be necessarily the best way\n",
      "but I think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids.\n",
      "That's the only way they're going to fund it, because if they start raising taxes for property, and people are going to throw a fit.\n",
      "That's,\n",
      "yeah,\n",
      "and, you know, that's,\n",
      "taxes right now are political suicide. You know,\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "and I don't think any politician's going to do that,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and the only thing, they, they would think of would be tuition, you know,\n",
      "if it works at colleges it will work down below.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "And, you know, that's going to, that's going to affect the people that are having kids in school, of course, which is probably the only fair thing to do.\n",
      "But, it will be hard for those that people, that have, have in school because they have to pay out even more.\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "And, you know, it's going to really hurt the, the middle class, uh, people, I think. Because, uh, they're the ones that will probably have to, to carry the brunt of the load.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "So, uh,\n",
      "And most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and, and knives and everything,\n",
      "I mean, good grief what's .\n",
      "Yeah\n",
      "now, that's, that's just unbelievable to me, you know.\n",
      "I can't believe that.\n",
      "I mean when I was in junior high and high school that never happened.\n",
      "You never heard about that.\n",
      "Well yeah,\n",
      "we didn't, we didn't even think about it, you know\n",
      "No.\n",
      "And now, you know, what do we have now.\n",
      "You know, got kids that, either got a, you know, a Magnum gun school,\n",
      "like good grief.\n",
      "right.\n",
      "I mean, I'd, I'd be afraid to be in school, I mean teaching, or even being a student\n",
      "and think what, what's it going to be like for my, my youngest, an my oldest son, when he goes to school.\n",
      "What's going to happen?\n",
      "I mean I, I'm afraid for him to go.\n",
      "Exactly,\n",
      "right.\n",
      "But there again , you can't hold them back.\n",
      "Another reason,\n",
      "and you want to encourage them, you know, to, to be active and everything in school,\n",
      "but, uh, you know, with all the peer pressure that's going on, with all the negative things, it is, uh, it's a tough environment to be growing up in.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and lot tougher than it was when I was going to school,\n",
      "and that was,\n",
      "well I was, I graduated high school in nineteen seventy-nine,\n",
      "so.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "That was what, twelve years ago, I guess.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "So, you know, it's lot different now.\n",
      "And what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my, uh, oldest son is in high school.\n",
      "That's right,\n",
      "that's right.\n",
      "I'm afraid to, I'm afraid to even think about it.\n",
      "That, yeah, that is a scary thought,\n",
      "but, uh, I don't know,\n",
      "I, I guess what you have to do is just, uh, keep in, uh, you know, encouraging them and, and, uh, uh, try to be open with them, so that you can deal with the problems as they come up.\n",
      "That's all you can do.\n",
      "Yeah,\n",
      "and.\n",
      "You got to, you got to be your child's best friend, I guess, even when they're a teenager and they, you know are kind of standoffish,\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "still you got to be their best friend because when they've got problems, who they going to go to, their friends that are dealing drugs, or, or your parents. You know,\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "an, and if they go to their friends dealing drugs, they're going to be in even worse shape.\n",
      "That's right.\n",
      "And, and the schools don't, don't really encourage to stay away from that, you know,\n",
      "the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war, etcetera, etcetera.\n",
      "They don't teach them good values like drugs are bad.\n",
      "I, maybe I'm wrong, because I haven't, you know, been in that kind of environment for a long time,\n"
