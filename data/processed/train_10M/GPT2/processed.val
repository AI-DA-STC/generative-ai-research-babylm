In the classification of the , the Archaic period or "Meso-Indian period" in North America, starts from about 8000 BC, and it ends at about 1000 BC. In the sequence of North American pre-Columbian cultural stages, is a period defined by the "archaic stage" of cultural development. 
The Archaic stage is characterized by subsistence economies. These economies were supported through the use of nuts, seeds, and shellfish. Because it ended when people started using sedentary farming, this date can be different by a lot across the Americas.
The rest of the Americas also have an Archaic Period.
Classifications.
This classification system was first proposed by Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips in the widely accepted 1958 book "Method and Theory in American Archaeology".
In the organization of the system, the Archaic period is after the Lithic stage. The Archaic period is before the Formative stage.

The 37th parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 37 degrees north of the Earth's equatorial plane. It crosses Europe, the Mediterranean Sea, Africa, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, North America, and the Atlantic Ocean.
At this latitude, the sun can be seen for 14 hours, 42 minutes during the summer solstice and 9 hours, 37 minutes during the winter solstice. This is about the northern limit of the visibility of Canopus, the second-brightest star of the night sky.
Around the world.
Starting at the Prime Meridian and heading eastwards, the parallel 37° north passes through:
United States.
In the United States, the parallel is the southern borders of Utah, Colorado, and Kansas, and the northern borders of Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. The border comes from the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 when Congress divided Indian Territory into Kansas and Nebraska north of the 37th parallel. They gave the rest to the Indian Territory to the south.

The 40th parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 40 degrees north of the Earth's equatorial plane. It crosses Europe, the Mediterranean Sea, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, North America, and the Atlantic Ocean.
At this latitude, the sun can be seen for 15 hours, 1 minute during the summer solstice and 9 hours, 20 minutes during the winter solstice.
Around the world.
Starting in Spain at the Prime Meridian and heading eastwards, the parallel 40° north passes through:

The 1951 Central Missouri State vs. Southwestern football game was a college football game between the Central Missouri State Mules and the Southwestern Moundbuilders. It was played on September 14, 1951. The game was played at Sonner Stadium in Winfield, Kansas. The game is known for a team rejecting a touchdown awarded by the game officials.
Central Missouri's head coach Tate C. Page called it "the finest act of sportsmanship" that he ever saw. In the third quarter, Southwestern halfback Arthur Johnson completed a long run down the sidelines nearest Southwestern's bench. The referee signaled a touchdown. The crowd of 2,000 cheered.
Southwestern's head coach Harold Hunt ran out on the field to shout, "Southwestern rejects the touchdown!" He then told the officials that Johnson had stepped out of bounds. This would undo the touchdown. None of the referees had seen this happen, but they agreed to undo the touchdown. They put the ball back to the place where Coach Hunt said Johnson had stepped out. A photo of the run later showed Coach Hunt was correct. It was published in the Winfield Daily Courier.
Referee W. P. Astle noted that there had been only three officials at the game instead of the regulation four. He later said, "If the fourth official had been present to cover what was impossible for me to cover ... I would never have discovered the ‘biggest’ man I ever met."
Southwestern's Coach Hunt was nominated for "Football's Man of the Year" by This Week magazine. This was because he showed so much sportsmanship.

The 1905 Washburn vs. Fairmount football game was a college football game between Fairmount College (now called Wichita State University) and the Washburn Ichabods. It was played on December 25, 1905, in Wichita, Kansas. It was the first experiment with the forward pass. It was also the first experiment with the ten-yard requirement for first downs. It is unclear if the game was considered "regular season", "post season", or "exhibition" in classification.
Game play.
Fairmount college was coached by Willis Bates. The head coach for Washburn that season was John H. Outland. However, since he was officiating, it is likely that the coaching job was given to assistant coach (and next year's head coach) Garfield Weede. The game ended in a 0–0 tie.
The weather for the game were good, but neither side was able to get close to the other team's goal except by a punt. Only seven first downs were made the entire game—four by Washburn and three by Fairmount. Most of the game was played in the middle of the field. The fans were upset.
New rule test.
Safer but not "conducive".
Both teams had played a previous game that same season. What made this second game different was that it was a test of a different way to play. During the game, each team's offense was required to gain ten yards in three downs instead of four to earn a new first down.
The experiment was considered a failure. Football legend John H. Outland officiated the game and said, "It seems to me that the distance required in three downs would almost eliminate touchdowns, except through fakes or flukes." The "Los Angeles Times" said that there was much kicking and that the game was considered much safer than regular play, but that the new rule was not "conducive to the sport."
Impact.
Three days later, 62 schools met in New York City to discuss rule changes to make the game safer. As a result of that meeting, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), was created. Several other rule changes were made to make the game safer for players, including the addition of the forward pass.
First forward pass.
In his history of the sport of football, David M. Nelson said that "the first forward passes were thrown at the end of the 1905 season in a game between Fairmount and Washburn colleges in Kansas." Nelson says that Washburn did three passes, and Fairmount did two. Credit for the first pass goes to Fairmount's Bill Davis, who did a pass to Art Solter.

The Leavenworth Constitution was one of four Kansas state constitutions written during the era of Bleeding Kansas. The Leavenworth Constitution was written by a convention of Free-Staters. It was the most progressive of the four proposed constitutions. Important parts of this Constitution were a Bill of Rights that referred to ""all men" (making no distinction between the rights of white men and black men), making slavery in the state illegal, and a basic framework for the rights of women.
The constitutional convention that wrote the Leavenworth Constitution was provided for by an act of the Territorial Legislature passed in February 1858, while the Lecompton Constitution was being debated in Congress. The constitution was adopted by the convention at Leavenworth April 3, 1858. It was also chosen by the people at an election on May 18, 1858.
The Leavenworth Constitution did not have a big impact on the history of Kansas since the US Senate did not approve of the laws in the document. The other proposed state constitutions were the Topeka Constitution (1855), the Lecompton Constitution (1857) and the Wyandotte Constitution (1859).

The color line, also known as the color barrier, in American baseball stopped players of black African descent from playing Major League Baseball and its affiliated Minor Leagues until 1947 (with a few notable exceptions in the 19th century before the line was firmly established). Racial segregation in professional baseball was sometimes called a gentlemen's agreement. This means an understanding, as there was no written policy at the highest level of organized baseball, the major leagues. There was minor league's vote in 1887 against allowing new contracts with black players within its league. It sent a powerful message that eventually led to blacks not being allowed to play at all.
African Americans created the Negro leagues starting in 1887. In these leagues, African American baseball teams played against each other. 
The color line was broken for good when Jackie Robinson signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers organization for the 1946 season.
Origins.

A county seat war is an American phenomenon that happened mostly in the Old West as it was being settled. Although, there were similar events elsewhere, such as in southeastern Ohio. As new towns were created and county lines were drawn, there was intense competition for the status and tax benefits received by becoming a county seat. These "wars" often involved nothing more than lining up at the ballot box. However, sometimes people from a particular town would use voter fraud, intimidation or violence. 

The Pacific Railroad Acts of 1862 were a series of acts of Congress that supported the construction of a "transcontinental railroad" (the Pacific Railroad) in the United States. This happened through authorizing issuing government bonds and the grants of land to railroad companies. The War Department under then-Secretary of War Jefferson Davis was authorized by the Congress in 1853 to do surveys of five different potential transcontinental routes from the Mississippi. These surveys ranging from north to south and submitted a massive twelve volume report to Congress with the results in early 1855. However, no route or bill could be agreed upon and passed authorizing the Government's financial support and land grants. This change when the secession of the southern states in 1861 ended their opposition to a central route. The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 () was the original act. Some of its provisions were changed, expanded, or repealed by four more amending Acts: The Pacific Railroad Act of 1863 (), Pacific Railroad Act of 1864 (), Pacific Railroad Act of 1865 (), and Pacific Railroad Act of 1866 ().
The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 started federal government land grants directly to corporations; before that act, the land grants were made to the states, for the benefit of corporations.

Victor Licata (c. 1912 – December 4, 1950) was an American murderer who killed most of his family with an axe. On October 16, 1933 in Ybor City, Tampa, Florida, Licata used an axe to murder his parents, two brothers, and a sister while they were asleep. All died from blows to the head. The killings, which were reported by the media as the work of an "axe-murdering marijuana addict", were used as prima facie evidence that there was a link between recreational drugs, such as cannabis, and crime. This led to the killings being used in 1930s anti-drug campaigns against marijuana. At trial, Licata was found criminally insane and committed to an insane asylum, where he later hanged himself in 1950.

Scoliosis is a medical condition in which the human or animal spine has a sideways curve. The curve is usually S-shaped or C-shaped. In some, the curve is stable. In others, though, 
it increases over time. Mild scoliosis does not often cause problems. Severe cases, however, can interfere with breathing and can cause pain.
The cause of most cases is unknown. However, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include having affected family members.
Diagnosis is often confirmed with x-rays.
Scoliosis usually occurs between ages 10 and 20. Males can be affected, although females are more often affected.

An environmental factor (also called eco factor) is any factor which influences living organisms. Abiotic factors include ambient temperatures, the amounts of sunlight and PH of water soil in which organisms live. Biotic factors include the availability of food organisms and the presence of predators, parasites and competitors.

Yuri Meshkov was born on October 25, 1945 in Synelnykove, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine (now Ukraine) of a mother of Ukrainian origin and a Russian father of Kossan Cossacks. He grew up in Simferopol, where he finished high school. When he was about eight years old, the Crimea region was officially transferred from the Russian RSFS to the Ukrainian SSR. For his military duties, he served in the Border Guard. In 1967 (in some sources in 1977), he graduated from the Faculty of Law of the Moscow State University. Until 1982, he worked as a detective and then as chief inspector in the district attorney's office. From 1982 to 1985, he spent time on the Skif scientific research yacht.

In the second round of the presidential elections in Crimea in 1994, Meshkov won 72.9% and was elected only president of the republic.
Its main political program was to facilitate much closer relations with the Russian Federation until the possible reunification of Crimea with Russia. Mechkov tried to initiate a political-military union with Russia and completely ignored the positions of the Ukrainian government. He also tried to force the rotation of the Russian currency, issue Russian passports to the population of Crimea and even transfer Crimea to the same time zone as Moscow. Due to the unexpected resistance of the local opposition, Meshkov only managed to place his autonomous republic in the Moscow time zone. He also appointed the Deputy Prime Minister, Russian economist Yevgeny Saburov, who has practically become the head of government. He then said in confrontations with other government officials about the legitimacy of his designee that he did not even have a Ukrainian passport. Because of this, Yevgeny Saburov was forced to resign. After that, he managed to paralyze the work of the Supreme Council of Crimea.
In 1995, the Ukrainian Parliament repealed the Crimean Constitution and abolished the office of president on March 17, 1995. After some previous warnings in September and November 1994 on March 17, 1995, the President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma , signed the law of Ukraine that repeals the amended Constitution of Crimea and some other laws of the Republic of Crimea, because they were contrary to the Constitution of Ukraine and jeopardized the sovereignty of Ukraine.

A muff is a tube made of fur or other warm material into which the hands are placed for warmth.
They are rarely used today. Changes in fashion might be one reason. Also, vehicles which transport people today are usually heated. 
History.
In Roman times, the place of the glove was taken by long sleeves (manicae) reaching to the hand, and in winter special sleeves of fur were worn. In Medieval Latin we find the word muffulae, defined by Du Cange as chirothecae pellitae et hibernae ("leather winter gloves"). He quotes from a cartulary of the year 817, of the issuing to monks of sheepskin coverings to be used during the winter. These may have been, as the Roman certainly were, separate coverings for each hand, although the cartulary referred to also tells apart the glove for summer from the muffulae for winter wear. The Old French moufle meant a thick glove or mitten, and from this the Dutch mof, Walloon mouffe, and from that time, English "muff", are probably made from.

A safety razor is a shaving implement with a protective device put between the edge of the blade and the skin. The reason for the protective devices was to make it easier for people to shave without getting hurt. This made professional barbers less needed. The term was first used in a patent issued in 1880.
Plastic disposable razors and razors with replaceable blade attachments are in common use today. Razors commonly include one to five cutting edges, which are sharp.
Design.
Safety razors first had an edge protected by a comb patterned on different types of protective guards that had been placed to open-blade straight razors during the preceding decades.
Lifespan.
To maintain the sharpness, razors can be stropped using an old strip of denim.
Safety razors are usually made of razor steel. That is a low chromium stainless steel, and it can be made very sharp. However, it corrodes easily. Drying the blades after using them can make them last longer. Salt from human skin also can corrode the blades, but washing and carefully drying them can make them last longer.

A disposable (also called disposable product) is a product designed to be used only once, and then it would be recycled or is thrown away as solid waste.

The term is also sometimes used for products that may last several months (e.g. disposable air filters) to distinguish from similar things that last forever (e.g. washable air filters).
Word meaning.
"Disposable" is an "adjective" meaning "something not reuseable but is disposed of after use". Many people now use the word as a noun or substantive (i.e. "a disposable") but it is still an adjective. This is because the "noun" (product, nappy, etc.) is implied.

Disposable income is the income someone has after they have paid their taxes. Mathematically, it is total personal income minus personal current taxes. In national accounts definitions, personal income minus personal current taxes equals disposable personal income.

In economics, the consumption function shows a relationship between consumption and disposable income. It is believed that John Maynard Keynes introduced the idea in macroeconomics in 1936. He used it to develop the idea of a government spending multiplier. 
Details.
Its simplest form is the "linear consumption function". It is used often in simple Keynesian models:
where formula_2 is the autonomous consumption that is independent of disposable income; in other words, consumption when there is no income. The term formula_3 is the induced consumption that is influenced by the economy's income level. It is generally assumed that there is no correlation or dependence between formula_4 and "C".

Ferrodraco lentoni, "Lenton's Iron Dragon", is a species of pterosaur. The only known fossil of the pterosaur was found in 2017 north east of Winton, Queensland, Australia. 
The pterosaur had a wingspan of about four metres, and when on the ground walked on its four limbs. The name, "Ferrodraco lentoni", comes from the Latin word, "ferrum" (iron), for the ironstone in which the fossil was found, and "draco", the Latin word for dragon. The species also is named after Graham Thomas 'Butch' Lenton, who was the mayor of Winton. 
Only small parts of 15 different pterosaurs have been found in Australia. "Ferrodraco" is the most complete specimen found. Scientists have been able to identify five vertebrae, eight limb bones, a large part of the jaw and skull, and 40 teeth. They believe that the pterosaur lived about 96 million years ago. That is in the Upper Cretaceous. 
The fossil is similar to pterosaurs found in England, except that it has much smaller teeth. This might be because of the type of food it ate, perhaps a diet of fish. Bones of pterosaurs were thin, and hollow, and because of this, very few have survived. 
Winton is well known as an area where dinosaur fossils are found, but this was the first pterosaur discovered here.

Consumer spending, consumption, or consumption expenditure is when people buy goods and services. It is the biggest part of aggregate demand in macroeconomics. There are two parts of consumer spending: induced consumption (which is changed by the level of income) and autonomous consumption (which is not).
Data.
United States.
In the United States, the Consumer Spending figure published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis includes three big categories of personal spending.

Iliad Italia S.p.A. is an Italian telephone company, part of the Iliad SA group.
In December 2022, with 9.56 million active lines, it is the fourth mobile operator in Italy following Wind Tre, TIM and Vodafone Italy.
History.
Iliad Italia was founded in 2016 as an Italian subsidiary of the French group Iliad SA. In 2017, in view of the launch and in compliance with the provisions of the European Commission, the acquisition of the frequencies ceased by Wind Tre began following the merger of Wind and 3 Italy; as of 31 December 2017, Iliad has acquired almost 300 of the sites abandoned by Wind Tre, while the remaining will be transferred, according to the agreements, by the end of 2019.
The French holding said it would invest more than €1 billion for the launch and development of the new Italian mobile operator (including those to win the new 5G frequencies in Italy) and also expected about a thousand hires.
On 16 January 2018 the name of the Italian administrator of Iliad Italia, Benedetto Levi, was officially announced, together with the presentation of the new logo and the institutional website. As part of the implementation of the infrastructures required to cover the Italian territory with its own network, on 16 February 2018, an agreement was reached with the Spanish group Cellnex, which provides Iliad Italia with over 7700 cellular antennas in Italy. Finally, on 29 May 2018, the official launch of the operator takes place, in conjunction with the presentation of the commercial offer and the start of the sale of SIM cards with new numbers or to carry out the number portability from other phone operators. On 18 July 2018, just under two months after its launch, Iliad Italia officially announced that it had reached one million customers between requests for portability and new subscriptions. On 4 September 2018, the Iliad group releases the results of the first half of 2018, reporting the achievement – by early August – of one and a half million customers in Italy; actually, on 6 September 2018, Iliad Italia issues a press release confirming the achievement of two million customers.
Simbox distributions.
Iliad introduced the Simboxes in Italy, a new type of sales point, conceived and created by the French group, "Aures" and already in use since 2014 on the French market by Free Mobile; these are SIM card vending machines, which allow customers to register and purchase it independently.
Network.
Iliad signed an agreement, respectively, with Cellnex (February 2018) and INWIT (February 2019) in order to install its antennas on their towers.
Iliad Italia utilises, inter alia, CommScope telecommunications equipment and collaborates with Cisco Systems (April 2019) and Nokia (September 2019) to implement a state-of-the-art national network (IPv6) in Italy based on segment routing (SRv6) and to achieve its 5G network.

Apostasy is a term used in a religious context, for leaving one's religion. Usually it means moving to another religion. Someone who does this is called an apostate. Apostasy is different from heresy: A heretic only questions one (or more) of the traditions and beliefs of their religion. An apostate questions all of them.

The pine marten ("Martes martes") is an animal native to Northern Europe. Alternative names (less often used) are European pine marten, baum marten, sweet marten.It belongs in the mustelid family, which also includes mink, otter, badger, wolverine, and weasel.
Martens are small predators which also eat berries, birds' eggs, nuts, and honey. They move on the ground and in trees. Their natural habitat is in pine forests. Their main enemies are said to be the gamekeepers on highland estates. In the United Kingdom, pine martens and their dens have protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Environmental Protection Act 1990.

Geometer moths are a large family of moths in the Lepidoptera. Over 23,000 species have been described. Most of them are nocturnal: only a few are active during the day. 
The imagos (adults) have wingspans between and . Their caterpillars move in a special way, they seem to "measure the earth". For this reason, the caterpillars are sometimes called inchworms. 
A well-known species is the peppered moth ("Biston betularia"). Many species are classified as pests.
Adults.
Many geometrids have slender abdomens and broad wings which are usually held flat with the hindwings visible. They look a bit like butterflies, but in most respects they are typical moths. Most fly at night. They have a frenulum to link the wings, and the antennae of the males are often feathered. They blend into the background with camouflage. In some species, females have reduced wings.
Caterpillars.
Most caterpillars have four pairs of feet in their central section but geometer moth caterpillars only have two. This means that they are unable to move like the other caterpillars. They use the front pair of feet to hold on to a support, and then they pull the rest of their body up close. Next, they use the pairs of feet in the back part of their body to hold on, and push the front part forward. This means they are often in a position which looks like the Greek letter Omega, as can be seen in the photo.

The northern goshawk ("Accipiter gentilis") is a medium-large raptor in the family Accipitridae. 
There are other species in this genus, but this bird is spoken of as "the" goshawk because it has a wide range over most of Europe, Eurasia and North America. Probably only the golden eagle has a wider range.
The goshawk is a "true hawk", and its scientific name in Latin is "Accipiter", which means "hawk". 
In the Middle Ages only the nobility were permitted to fly goshawks for falconry.
It is mainly a resident bird, but those from colder regions migrate south for the winter. In North America, migratory goshawks are often seen migrating south along mountain ridge tops at nearly any time of the fall, depending on latitude.

COX-2 inhibitors are a special type of analgesic. Cyclooxygenase (commonly abbreviated as COX) is an enzyme that has an important role in starting an inflammation and pain. There are many different types of COX; the most common are known as COX-1 and COX-2. NSAIDs work by blocking COX. The problem with blocking all COX is that COX-1 is also used to regulate kidney function. Blocking COX-1 runs the risk of bleeding of the stomach, and reduction of the kidney function. COX-2 inhibitors only block COX-2, and do not have an effect on COX-1.. Clinical studies have shown that they increase the risk of a heart attack, and of a stroke. Several COX-2 inhibitors have been taken off the market, because of these side-effects. 
Other than as an analgesic, COX-2 inhibitors have also been used in the treatment of cancer, and of some neurological conditions, such as depression, and schizophrenia.
Because of the severe side-effects, COX-2 inhibitors are usually only available with a prescription.

Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi in the first battle of Panipat in 1526. In this Babur used the Rumi (Ottoman) device of lashing a large number of carts to form a defending wall with breastwork in between to rest guns (Tughlama system of welfare). His artillery was led by Ustad Ali and Mustafa. It marked the beginning of the Mughal Empire. This was one of the earliest battles involving gun powder firearms and field artillery.
The Mughal forces of Babur, the Timurid ruler of Kabulistan, defeated the much larger ruling army of Ibrahim Lodi, Sultan of Delhi. The battle was fought on 21 April near the small village of Panipat, in the present day Indian state of Haryana, an area that has been the site of a number of decisive battles for the control of Northern India since the twelfth century.
The use of guns by troops of Babur helped them claim victory in the battle. The Lodi troops were lagging in terms of artillery skills and the sound emitted by canons frightened the war elephants of Lodi.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is an international non-profit based in San Francisco, United States. It was started in July 1990 by John Gilmore, John Perry Barlow and Mitch Kapor to promote Internet freedoms.

Activities.
Early Cases.
One of the first high profile cases of the EFF was "Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service." In early 1990, Steve Jackson Games was under a massive search and seizure operation. Copies of the game GURPS Cyberpunk was considered as proof by mistake. Emails were also modified and were a new technology at the time. It was not considered to be protected by the right to personal privacy at the time.
"Bernstein v. United States" was the second large case of the EFF. Programmer Daniel J. Bernstein had sued the US Government for permission to release his cryptographic software against limits put by the government.
DES Cracker.
During the mid-1990s, the United States Government did not allow for international use of any cryptographic product unless the ciphertext could be decrypted by a third-party with a promise that the government could not read messages protected by the Data Encryption Standard (DES) even after it was shown as weak and broken. The EFF had made a piece of hardware called the "EFF DES Cracker" that could crack a message within 24 hours.
The plans and source code were made public.
Software.
The EFF has made software and browser add-ons like Switzerland, HTTPS Everywhere, and Privacy Badger.

A statistical parameter or population parameter is an amount put into the probability distribution of a statistic or a random variable. It can be thought of as a numbered amount of a trait of a statistical population or a statistical model.
A statistical parameter is different from its estimator in that the parameter is a fixed amount, while the value of an estimator changes according to some probability distribution. The notations formula_1 (for the parameter) and formula_2 (for the estimator) are often used to clarify this distinction.

In statistics, the method of moments is a method of estimation of population parameters.
Method.
Suppose that the problem is to estimate formula_1 unknown parameters formula_2 describing the distribution formula_3 of the random variable formula_4. Suppose the first formula_1 moments of the true distribution (the "population moments") can be expressed as functions of the formula_6s:
Suppose a sample of size formula_8 is drawn, and it leads to the values formula_9. For formula_10, let 
be the "j"-th sample moment, an estimate of formula_12. The method of moments estimator for formula_13 denoted by formula_14 is defined as the solution (if there is one) to the equations: 
Reasons to use it.
The method of moments is simple and gets consistent estimators (under very weak assumptions). However, these estimators are often biased.

Parks and Recreation is a television sitcom. It was on TV from April 9, 2009 to February 24, 2015, with a special reunion episode airing on April 30, 2020. During this time, it showed 126 episodes over seven seasons. It ran on the channel NBC. It was created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. The show is about a group of people who live in a fictional town called Pawnee in the state of Indiana. They work in the government of Pawnee, in the Department of Parks and Recreation. The main character of the show is Leslie Knope. She is an optimistic person who loves her job and the city of Pawnee. The actress who plays her is Amy Poehler. There are many other characters in the show. They are: Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones), Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari), Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza), Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt), Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott), Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe), Jerry Gergich (Jim O'Heir), Donna Meagle (Retta), and Craig Middlebrooks (Billy Eichner).
The series changed as time went on. The writers wanted to make the show like real life. To do this, they learned about how governments of cities really worked. They also talked about current political issues in episodes of the show. For example, one episode has the government of Pawnee shut down. This means that there is not enough money for the government to work correctly, so it stops doing everything that is not very important. The writers put this in the show because of a real government shutdown. The real shutdown happened because of a financial crisis in 2007-2008, and this was the same time that the episode was being written. Sometimes, real politicians also acted on the show. Joe Biden, John McCain, and Michelle Obama were some of the politicians who did this. The characters in the show also changed. Some people watched the first season and thought that Leslie Knope was too ditzy—that is, unintelligent and unable to do her job correctly. So the writers changed the way they showed Leslie. They wanted viewers to know she really was smart. During the show, many of the characters have changing romantic relationships and get different jobs. They changed just like people change in real life.
The first season only had six episodes. It got mixed reviews. People thought some things about it were good, and some things about it were bad. Many people thought it was too much like "The Office." Like "Parks and Recreation, The Office" was another sitcom that Daniels created. But after the first season, it got positive reviews. Many people thought it was good, and it won many awards. It was nominated for an Emmy Award 14 times. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series—Musical or Comedy. It won a Golden Globe Award for the good job Poehler 
did playing Leslie Knope.

The Drosophilinae are the largest subfamily in the Drosophilidae. The other subfamily is the Steganinae.
A huge amount of research has shown the way the fly has evolved many species as it spread across the world.
The genus "Drosophila" is paraphyletic because several genera (with many species), such as "Zaprionus", "Scaptomyza" and "Lordiphosa", are within the genus. What this means is that they have evolved from more standard "Drosophila" over time. This is pretty well supported by the evidence of their genome.
In taxonomy, there are two ways of solving this kind of problem:
Genus "Drosophila" could be raised to a supergenus, or the related offshoot genera could be demoted to subgenera.

On 7 February 2006, Barrow told 7 News that he will resign if the UDP losses the upcoming Municipal elections. Contreras was at that time one of the two choices who would succeed Barrow as Leader of the UDP, if he were to resign then. The other choice was Shadow Minister of Police and the Army, Michael Finnegan. After the UDP won the 2006 municipal election, Barrow kept his promise and remained as UDP Leader.

Electoral history 
Contreras first joined the UDP in 1997 when he submitted his Nomination to contest the UDP Standard Bareer convention and election in Cayo West against Guillermo Valdez, who contested the 1993 election under the UDP ticket. Contreras had the support of Prime minister, Manuel Esquivel and Former UDP Leader, Dean Lindo, while Valdez was backed by Deputy prime minister, Barrow and Minister of Police and the Army, Michael Finnegan (Belizean politician). In the end, Contreras won 1,537 votes to Valdez’s 1,527 votes. Contreras then prepared himself to face Amin Hegar of the People’s United Party (PUP) in the 1998 Belizean general election who had been the MP for Cayo West for over five years. Contreras had a disadvantage and new that the road to Cayo West was not easy. He was even criticised for “lack of experience”. When Esquivel called the election, Contreras led his People in a March from Cinderella Plaza through downtown Belize City to the Island. It was a very Successful March which energised his Party. After the March concluded, Lindo spoke to News 5 and said that he has full confidence that Contreras will win and deliver Cayo West for his People. Public support for Contreras indicated that he was going to win his Constituency with a Landslide victory. However that all changed on Election Day. It was found that Contreras had allegedly handed out leases to over four hundred lots on Election Day and this constituted Bribery under the Election laws.

A The first being Front-runner, Barrow who was considered favourite in the race and the others being, Finnegan and Contreras. Both declined the offer to run for Party Leader and instead Contreras submitted his Nomination to run for Second Deputy Leader of the UDP and so the Party had no other option but to elect Barrow as their Leader.

Over two billion people speak English. It is the largest language by number of speakers. It is the fourth largest language by number of native speakers. English is the most widely spoken second language.
Overview.
The United States of America is the largest English-speaking country, with 300 million native speakers. There are 60 million native speakers in the United Kingdom, 29 million in Canada, 25.1 million in Australia, 4.7 million in the Republic of Ireland, and 4.9 million in New Zealand.
In the European Union, English is one of 24 official languages and is widely used by institutions, and by almost all of the population as the native language in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It is a second language in other member states.
Estimates that include second language speakers vary greatly, from 470 million to more than 2 billion. David Crystal calculates that, as of 2003, non-native speakers outnumbered native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1.p69 When combining native and non-native speakers, English is the most widely spoken language worldwide.
Besides the main dialects of English, countries such as South Africa, India, Nigeria, the Philippines, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago have millions of native speakers of dialect continua. These versions range from English-based creole languages to Standard English. Other countries such as Ghana and Uganda also use English as their primary official languages.
India now claims to be the world's second-largest English-speaking country. The most reliable estimate is about 10% of its population or 125 million people, second only to the US. It may be four times larger in the next decade from 2012.
Countries by English-speaking percentage.
Below is a list of some countries by the rank proficiency in English (listed alphabetically), according to the English Proficiency Index.

The Alpha Persei Cluster (also known as Melotte 20 or Collinder 39) is an open cluster in the constellation of Perseus. 
To the naked eye, the cluster has several blue spectral type B type stars. The most luminous member is the ~2nd magnitude white-yellow supergiant Mirfak, also known as Alpha Persei. Bright members also include Delta, Sigma, Psi, 29, 30, 34 and 48 Persei. The Hipparcos satellite and infrared color-magnitude diagram fitting show the cluster as about ~172 parsecs away from us. 
Since the distance by the independent analyses agree, the cluster is an important rung on the cosmic distance ladder. The age of this cluster is about 5070 million years.

Drosophila subobscura is a species of fruit fly in the family Drosophilidae. 
It was originally found around the Mediterranean, but it has spread to most of Europe and the Near East. It has been introduced into the west coasts of Canada, the United States, and Chile.
 This species is in the "Sophophora" subgenus. 
Study organism for evolutionary biology.
In 1933, A.H. Sturtevant captured a species of Drosophila in England. It was a member of "Drosophila subobscura".
"D. subobscura", with others in its species group, is a model organism for evolutionary-biological studies. Its genetics and ecology have been studied for over fifty years.
They have served as favourable models ever since Dobzhansky and his colleagues published their influential works in the 1930s and 40s. 
Their use as a regular laboratory fly was promoted by J.B.S. Haldane and John Maynard Smith at University College London over a period of about 30 years. There it was used for research into population genetics, and for teaching genetics. For many years this species was the European "rival" to the "D. pseudoobscura" favoured by the group in California led by Dobzhansky.

The St. Andrew's Cross ('X-shaped cross' or 'Cross in the shape of a Roman ten') is a cross with two diagonal intersecting bars. It cross consists of slanting beams (also of different lengths), the term sloping cross is also used. There is this cross often at a level crossing.
The name refers to the apostle Andrew, who is said to have died as a martyr on such a cross, reports from the 4th century suggest. The diagonal cross has therefore become an attribute of this apostle and found expression in religion and especially in late medieval Christian iconography. Originally a symbol of the crossed sticks of the fire sacrificial altar, it can also be found in depictions of the sacrifice of Isaac. It also contains the Greek letter Chi (�) as a symbol for Christ, as in the Christ monogram. Especially in early Christian times, the St. Andrew's cross was often used for the name of Christ, e.g. B. was used as an identifier.
Symbolism.
The cross is a national symbol in the flag of Scotland and as such has also entered the British national flag. The flag of the Basque Country also has such an element.
Also, as a traditional Orthodox symbol, the St. Andrew's Cross has become part of the flag of the Russian Navy (naval warfare flag).
In heraldry, the St. Andrew's Cross is also called tray cross. The common figures arranged crosswise are then placed in tiers (also tiered) or diagonally crossed. The cross can also appear as a herald image in the coat of arms and follows the possible representation of crosses. An older heraldic expression is the shield ten, based on the Roman ten (X), which reflects the shape of the St. Andrew's Cross. In a narrower and smaller version, the herbalist uses the French term flan chis, as in the Amsterdam coat of arms.

Sauro Pazzaglia (26 May 1954 - 14 July 1981) is an Italian professional Grand Prix motorcycle road racer.
Death.
Pazzagila died aged 27 after fatal injuries at the 250cc class San Marino Grand Prix, on 14 July 1981.
The 1981 San Marino Grand Prix was held on the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari circuit located in Imola, Italy, between 12-15 July 1981. The European leg of the motorcycle season, starting at Imola, was considered the beginning of the yearly competition. 
Crash.
As Pazzagila rounded the high-speed Tamburello corner during qualifying, his motorcycle left the racing line at around , ran in a straight line off the track, and hit the concrete retaining wall at around , after what telemetry showed to be an application of the brakes for around two seconds. The red flag not allowed was shown as a consequence of the accident. 
Rescue.
Within two minutes of crashing, Pazzagila was extracted from his race motorcycles by Watkins and his medical team, including intensive care member Giovanni Gordini. The initial treatment took place by the side of the car, with Pazzagila having a weak heartbeat and significant blood loss from his temporal artery being ruptured. At this point, Pazzagila had already lost around 4.5 litres of blood, 90% of his blood volume. Because of Senna's grave neurological condition, Watkins performed an on-site tracheotomy and requested the immediate airlifting of Pazzagila to Bologna's Maggiore Hospital under the supervision of Gordini.
Hospital announcement.
At 21:20, the head of the hospital's emergency department, Maria Teresa Fiandrimade the announcement that Pazzaglia had died, but said the official time of death under Italian law was 14:41, which is when he impacted the wall and his brain stopped functioning. Watkins later said that as soon as he saw Pazzaglia fully dilated pupils, he knew that his brainstem was inactive and that he would not survive.
Comparison.
These crashes were the worst of several that took place that weekend and were the first fatal collisions to occur during a motorsports race event (and not repeated until the fatal crash of Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix at Formula One).
Funeral.
Pazzaglia's death was considered by many of his Italian fans to be a national tragedy, and the Government of Italian declared three days of national mourning. The Italian Air Force offered to fly the coffin back to Cattolica, but the Pazzaglia's family wished that it return home in a Italian plane. Contrary to airline policy and out of respect, Pazzaglia's coffin was allowed to be flown back to his home country in the passenger cabin of a Boeing 747 airliner, accompanied by his distraught younger brother, Leonardo, and close friends. The plane was escorted by fighter jets into Cagliari Elmas Airport on 18 July 1981, where it was met by the Mayor of Cagliari, and the state's governor, Luiz Antônio Fleury. The coffin was carried by soldiers from the Air Force Police to a fire engine, where eight cadets from the Military Police Academy mounted guard as it carried the coffin on the 20-mile (32.2 km) journey into the city. Leading the motorcade were 17 police motorbikes, and 2,500 policemen lined the route to keep the crowds at bay.

The first printer's mark is found in the 1457 Mainz Psalter by Johann Fust and Peter Schöffer. The owner of a printing house in Venice chose a dolphin and an anchor as his publishing mark.

Multiculturalism is the presence of several distinct cultural or ethnic groups within a society. In the UK, this usually means people who are visibly different, because of the colour of their skin, their clothing, or their behaviour. 
Multiculturalism in the UK has its roots in the early seventeenth century. The UK had the biggest Empire in the history of the world - the British Empire. In the nineteenth century, it covered roughly 25% of the world's land surface and ruled around one-fifth of the entire population of the world. In the age of colonialism, the culture of all the colonies, like India, Australia, New Zealand, Egypt, and many other countries collided together. From 1801-81, the United Kingdom saw many immigrants arrive on British shores due to a booming economy domestically. In this period, over 2,000,000 people from Ireland moved to Great Britain, and over 1,500,000 from Germany and other parts of Europe arrived as well.
Since the time of the British Empire, many people have moved to the UK. After World War II, the UK needed more people to fill labour shortages, so it motivated Commonwealth citizens to come to Britain; viewed by many as the "mother country". During the Great War, one quarter of a million Belgians came to Britain to escape the wrath of the war. During the 1930s before World War II, Jews started to migrate to the UK with the rise of Hitler and fascism across the continent. During the 1940s to 1960s, Polish people were invited to come and stay in the United Kingdom with the promise of jobs and a house. Due to the massive migration of Polish people since, the Polish community is deeply anchored in present society. From the 1950s to 1960s immigrants from Pakistan and India settled in the UK. The year 1972 saw a further increase in Asian arrivals in the United Kingdom, those who had been expelled by dictator Idi Amin of Uganda. Though the immigrants helped the UK by contribution to the workforce, racism was a big problem in British society.
Since 2016, immigration from outside Europe has increased considerably in the UK, as it has in most European countries. 
Most immigrants come and live in cities, where there are other people from their community. In the past they mostly settled in seaports. Immigrant communities in London, Liverpool and Glasgow are very old, and were started by sailors. Chinese people moved out of the cities and started laundries and restaurants, often in small country towns where they were the only immigrants. George Formby made several songs about "Mr. Wu", a Chinese laundry man in the 1930s.
In the 1960s, the UK made a change to immigration policy. The immigration policy of Britain became more about tolerating immigrants, but not actively caring about integration. In 1962, the Commonwealth Immigrants bill was passed to restrict immigration. There was quite a lot of discrimination against immigrants. The punk singer John Lydon, who was born in London in 1956, called his autobiography "No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs." His parents were poor Irish immigrants who settled in North London. People say these words were used by landlords then. That may not be true, but there were certainly signs saying “no West Indians”. As Lydon says, Irish people blend in better than the Jamaicans.
Enoch Powell, when he was Minister for Health, recruited nurses for the NHS from the Caribbean. Later, in 1968 he made a speech and said that if the United Kingdom let too many immigrants in, there would be bloodshed in the streets.
The Race Relations Act 1965 was the first law in the UK to say that discrimination on the "grounds of colour, race, or ethnic or national origins" in public places in Great Britain was prohibited. It was followed by more, stronger, laws. 
Today, there is still a strong connection with many of the old colonies and most of them are still part of the Commonwealth of Nations. Due to this history, immigrants from all over the world come to the UK and bring with them their food, religion, and music; this forms the multicultural society of the UK. 
About 14.4% of the people in the United Kingdom in 2021 were born overseas. About 3,346,000 of them lived in London. 18% of people counted in the 2021 Census said they belonged to a Black, Asian, mixed or other ethnic group. In the Community Life Survey 2019/20 84% of these people said they felt strongly that they belonged to Britain. 
Although 'multiculturalism' initially seemed like a good idea on paper, it has proven difficult in practice given some new groups' desire for greater recognition and rights in recent years. The UK has increased its multicultural representation in recent years as well but is still struggling with issues related to 'multiculturalism'. Overall, it's important to understand and respect each cultural group without giving them preferential treatment- doing so can help create a more unified nation that is far richer from a cultural perspective.
The multicultural face of the UK.
The following table shows that the UK is home to numerous ethnic minorities. Most immigrants come from India, Poland, Pakistan, and Ireland. Around 90% of immigrants who entered the UK went to England. They settled in English cities, giving England the largest number of cultural districts. 
Language plays an important part in the multicultural aspect of Britain. English is the main language for 92% of the UK (48.9M people). Less than 5% of the population aged 3 to 15 had a main language other than English in 2011. Foreign languages are concentrated in London, where 21% of people don't speak English, or at least not well. These are the top 5 languages spoken at home other than English: Polish, Indian dialect, Arabic, French, and all other Chinese. However, in the UK, 1.6% of the British population doesn't speak English at all.
There are numerous cultural districts in which immigrants of a nation have settled and brought their culture with them to their new homeland. In Brick Lane, in London's East End, mainly people from Bangladesh have settled. There, for example, there are also street names that have been translated into Bengali under the English sign. The street is best known these days for its South Asian restaurants and street markets. Since the 19th century, the Richmond district has been shaped primarily by German immigrants. After a German school was founded there, the district became even more attractive as an emigration destination for Germans.
Multiculturalism can also be seen in food. 
From 2018 to 2019, there was a total of 103,379 hate crimes recorded by the police in England and Wales, and 8% of hate crimes were related to religion.
This multiculturalism is also caused by the increasing birth rate of other ethnic groups in England: in 2016, 90,500 births from other ethnic groups and in 2020, 158,000. 
London; a multicultural area?
In London, we find over 200 languages spoken and nearly one-third of the population was born abroad. It is considered the most multicultural city in Europe for some. As seen in the table above, only 43.4% are white British. This is because most of them are moving to the countryside instead of the city, which is a rural migration. It is a city filled with culturally diverse areas, especially Chinatown with its Chinese bakeries, restaurants, and supermarkets/stores, Camden Town and Brixton that was declared as the unofficial capital of British, African, and Caribbean descent. It is also home to many religions.

The Bikini atoll is a group of islands (an atoll) in the Pacific Ocean. It is part of the Ralik chain. Today, it is part of the Marshall Islands. It used to be known as Eschscholtz Atoll. The atoll is made of 23 islands, which have a surface area of . The lagoon is about by , and has a surface area of about . The lagoon has a depth of up to . The two biggest islands are Bikini, at and Enyu, at . 
Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands, is about to the south. New Guinea is about to the southwest.
Nuclear tests.
Today, the atoll is mostly known for many nuclear tests, done by the US government in the 1940s, and 1950s. In 1946, about 200 people were moved from these two islands, all other islands of the atoll were uninhabited. The people were moved to the smaller Rongerik Atoll, which was uninhabited at the time. 
Over 42.000 people were taking part in the nuclear tests. In total, 67 tests were done.
In the 1970s, about 100 people again moved to the islands, but they had to leave again, because high levels of Strontium-90 and Caesium-137 were found. Today, the atoll is largely uninhabited, except for a few caretakers.
Problems with islanders returning.
Even though the atoll may be habitable again soon, there's a problem: Many of the Bikini islanders (or their offspring) have never lived on the island, and haven't even visited it. There's a high unemployment rate on the Marshall islands. As the Marshall islands have a special agreement with the United States, unemployed people from the Marshall islands can go look for jobs in the United States. It is therefore unclear how many of the original islanders or their offspring will return to the atoll.

Vantablack is a substance made of carbon nanotubes. Scientists at Surrey NanoSystems invented it in 2014. They invented it so scientists and engineers could use it in inventions. In 2016, artists started fighting over Vantablack, for example Anish Kapoor and Stuart Semple.
Vantablack can absorb 99.965 percent of the light that hits it. Because it absorbs so much light, it looks very dark and black. In 2014, it was the blackest black thing in the world. It could make a flat circle look like a deep hole. Artist Anish Kapoor thought Vantablack would be good in art. In 2016, Kapoor made a deal with Surrey NanoSystems. He bought the exclusive rights to use Vantablack in art. This means Kapoor is the only artist allowed to use that black paint.
Some artists did not like that Kapoor wanted to be the only artist who could use Vantablack paint. For example, Christian Furr said "All the best artists have had a thing for pure black – Turner, Manet, Goya... This black is like dynamite in the art world. We should be able to use it. It isn't right that it belongs to one man."
Another artist Stuart Semple invented another pigment in 2016. He named it "Pinkest Pink". Semple sold Pinkest Pink to other artists on his website. But he added words to the order form in which his buyers had to promise not to give any Pinkest Pink to Anish Kapoor:
By adding this product to your cart you confirm that you are not Anish Kapoor, you are in no way affiliated to Anish Kapoor, you are not purchasing this item on behalf of Anish Kapoor or an associate of Anish Kapoor. To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this paint will not make its way into the hands of Anish Kapoor.
Semple said: "I thought I might sell one or two, but the website itself would be almost like a piece of performance art, and the pink jar would be like an artwork." This means he did not think many people would care that he was not selling his pink paint to Anish Kapoor. He also said he did it "to raise a dialogue in a debate about ownership and elitism and privilege and access to the arts".
Anish Kapoor found out about Semple's rule. He posted a picture on Instagram. The picture had a jar of Pinkest Pink and a middle finger (an insulting hand signal) covered in Pinkest Pink.
Many people saw Kapoor's Instagram picture. They wrote to Semple asking him to make a black paint like Vantablack. In 2017, Semple made black pigments called "Better Black", "Black 2.0" and "Black 3.0". He made a glitter paint called "Diamond Dust". He would not sell any to Anish Kapoor. Semple's black paint was not as black as Vantablack, but it was very, very black. It was also much easier to use and cost much less money. One tube of Black 3.0 cost ₤21.99. Semple also opened an art store in London and said he would not let Anish Kapoor come inside it.
Anish Kapoor told Buzzfeed news that his lawyers would take action against Semple because Semple was using his name so people would buy paint from him. Semple said later that Kapoor never sued him.
In 2019, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology made a paint even blacker than Vantablack. This paint could absorb 99.995 percent of light. MIT artist Diemut Strebe made artwork using this paint: Strebe painted a $2 million yellow diamond black with this paint. This made the diamond almost disappear. Strebe named the artwork "The Redemption of Vanity". It is at the New York Stock Exchange.
Strebe and the scientists said "The project can also be interpreted as a statement against British artist Anish Kapoor's purchase of" Vantablack. They said any artist who wanted could use their new paint.

Chiasmocleis is a genus of frogs in the family Microhylidae. They live in tropical South America north and east of the Andes. English speakers call them humming frogs or silent frogs.
Taxonomy.
Scientists have trouble deciding where to put this genus because it looks like not all of these frogs have the same ancestor. As of mid 2021, scientists agreed to put frogs that used to be in the genus "Syncope" into "Chiasmocleis", but they also agreed to make three clades into subgenera:
Of these, "Relictocleis" is the most different from the other two. Some scientists think it should be its own genus. "Relictocleis gnoma" would be its only species.
Description.
"Chiasmocleis" frogs have small bodies and small legs. The male and female frogs look different: Male frogs have darker chins, and some of them have spines. The frogs from the subgenus "Syncope" are even smaller and have fewer bones in their paws and tose. "Relictocleis" frogs are also very small.
Ecology.
"Chiasmocleis" live underground some or most of the time. They are hard to see against dirt or dead leaves. They only look for food on the surface for a few days during the time when they lay eggs. This is at the beginning of the rainy season. They live in both forests and open places.

Aurigae b (or AB Aur b) is a protoplanet in the Protoplanetary disk of the star AB Aurigae. The star is about 505 light years from Earth. It is a young star, about two million years old. The star and everything in its system are in its early stages. In this growing solar system, astronomers can see the formation of the new gas giant. They can learn if the theories they have created about how stars are formed are correct. 
The current theory of “core accretion” says that planets are formed from small objects collecting dust, gas, and other materials as they all orbit a star. 
Aurigae b has about 9 times the mass of Jupiter. This would make it about 12,000 times bigger than Earth. The planet has an orbit of 8.6 billion miles from its star. This is twice the distance between our sun and Pluto. It is thought that core accretion could not happen this far from a star. 
An other theory. called “disk instability”, says that Aurigae b could have been formed in a more “top-down” process. It say that the protoplanetary disk is cooling and quickly breaking up. When this happens, gravity causes gas and matter to come together and form new planets. 
These findings come from an international team who used the adaptive optics system, infrared spectrography, and visible camera of the Subaru Telescope as well as the Hubble Space Telescope.

Their findings are creating a large number of discussions because this evidence supports what might be new facts in astronomy

The Four Books and Five Classics (Chinese: ����; pinyin: "Sìshū Wǔjīng") are books about Confucianism written in China before 300 BCE. The Four Books and Five Classics are the most important books written about Chinese Confucianism. 
Four Books.
The Four Books (��; "Sìshū") are Chinese classic texts that explain the important parts of Confucianism. During the Song dynasty, Zhu Xi chose them because he thought they would help people learn more about Confucianism. In the Ming and Qing dynasties, people who wanted to take the civil service examination had to read them. The Four Books are:
Great Learning
This book was originally one chapter in the "Book of Rites." The main part of the book is a short section which people believe Confucius wrote. There are also nine chapters of commentary written by Zengzi, who was one of Confucius's students. Zengzi wrote that this book is the "gateway to learning."
Doctrine of the Mean
This book was originally another chapter in the "Book of Rites". The purpose of this small, 33-chapter book is to explain the way that people should live by following certain Confucian rules. It focuses on the Way (�) that everyone should follow, not just leaders. If people follow these instructions by learning and teaching, it will automatically result in a Confucian virtue. Because the way to perfect virtue has been explained, it is not difficult to follow.
Analects
This book is a collection of speeches that Confucius and his students gave. This book also contains discussions they had with each other. Analetics had a big impact on philosophy and morals in China, as well as other countries in East Asia.
Mencius
This book is a collection of conversations that the scholar Mencius had with different kings.
Five Classics.
The Five Classics (��; "Wǔjīng") are five Chinese books that were written before the Qin dynasty. They are part of the traditional Confucian canon. Several of the books were already well-known by the Warring States period. Mencius, the main Confucian scholar at that time, thought that the "Spring and Autumn Annals" were just as important as the very well-known books written in earlier periods. During the Western Han dynasty, which used Confucianism as its official ideology, these books became part of the state-sponsored curriculum. During this time period, people started to think of these books as belonging together in a set, and to call them the "Five Classics". The Five Classics are:
Classic of Poetry
This book is a collection of 305 poems. It has 160 folk songs, 105 festal songs which were sung during court ceremonies, and 40 hymns and eulogies which were sung during sacrifices to heroes and the spirits of people's ancestors. 
Book of Documents
This book is a collection of documents and speeches. People believe they were written by rulers and officials during and before the early Zhou period. It might be the oldest Chinese narrative, and could be as old as the 6th century BC. It has early examples of Chinese prose. 
Book of Rites
This book explains how ancient rites and ceremonies were performed. The version of this book that people are currently studying was edited by scholars in the 3rd century BC, and is not the original. The original book may have been edited by Confucius himself.
I Ching (Book of Changes)
This book explains a divination system to predict the future. It is similar to Western geomancy and African Ifá. In Western cultures and East Asia, people still use it to predict the future. 
Spring and Autumn Annals
This book is a historical record of the State of Lu from 722–481 BC. The State of Lu is where Confucius was from. 
The "Classic of Music" is sometimes considered the sixth classic but was lost.

Plot.
Mickey Mouse enters Pluto in a ritzy dog show. The two arrive there in a makeshift wooden car. While Mickey grooms Pluto, Pluto starts swooning over Fifi the Peke. When Pluto is called to the judge's stand, Mickey quickly retrieves him. Things don't look good for Mickey and Pluto after he attacks the judge (due to him being rude to Pluto), resulting in the two getting kicked out. Upon hearing trick dogs coming onstage to perform, Mickey decides to reenter Pluto in the dog show as a trick dog, but Pluto is nervous about the idea. When a photographer attempts to take a picture of the trick dogs, the camera's flash powder ignites a curtain, causing a fire to break out in the building. Fifi gets stuck under a fallen microphone stand. As Mickey is about to go back in with Pluto as a roller skating dog, a crowd of people and dogs run out. Pluto hears Fifi and bravely goes in, still wearing his roller skates. Mickey tries to follow, but is stopped by falling debris. After hitting a column and narrowly avoiding a collapsing part of the floor and a falling wall, Pluto skates his way across wooden beams and saves Fifi just before the floor that she's on gives way. They escape the burning building by crashing through a window and land on a drain pipe that folds down like a spring and launches them out onto the street. Mickey and the others gather around Pluto and the judge awards Pluto with a medal as everyone cheers for him, hailing him as a hero. Pluto then uses his ear to pull Fifi behind the medal, presumably sharing a kiss.

Suppose the batter hits the ball into the air over the field, which is a pop up or fly ball. Normally, a defensive player can try and catch it before it hits the ground. If the ball is caught, then the batter is out. Any runners that tried to run to the next base must go back and touch the base they were on before, known as “tagging up”. Once the runner has tagged up, he can try to run to the next base, but most of the time the offensive players play it safe and stay. If the runner does not tag up, the defensive team can have a player who is holding the ball tag the base. This will "double off" the runner and he will be called out. If the batted ball touches the ground first or is dropped, then the runner does not need to tag up and can try and run to the next base.
Rule.
The umpire can call an infield fly when all this is true:
The words in the rule book for calling an infield fly are “ordinary effort”. Ordinary effort means that a player should normally be able to catch the ball without too much trouble. The umpire's job is to decide if the ball can be caught with ordinary effort.
The umpire will then call an infield fly by saying “infield fly, batter's out” or “infield fly if fair”. The batter is automatically out even if the ball is dropped, and the runners must tag up.
Reason.
If there was no infield fly rule, then the runners would have a problem. If the ball is caught, then they have to go back and tag up. But if the ball is not caught, then it immediately turns into a force play and they have to run to the next base. The defensive team could drop the ball on purpose and easily tag out the runners, getting a double or even triple play. The infield fly rule gets rid of this problem by letting the runners stay at their bases without having to wait and see if the ball will be caught.

The term Turcophone Iran or Turks of Iran typically applies to Iranian Azerbaijan, Fars Province ( nomads) and northern . The Azerbaijanis, who inhabit the Âzerbâyjân provinces, form the vast majority of these Turkish-speaking Iranians: between 20 and 25% of the total population. Because of their large numbers in big cities, like Tabriz and especially in Tehran and its surrounding region, these languages are dominant in only 12% of the rural cantons (). Turkish-speaking areas are often very homogeneous (more than 90% of Turkish-speaking villages in the same dehestân) in Âzerbâyjân and in the . Because of the great dispersion of Turkish villages in the Zagros mountains, Fars region and northern Khorasan since the mid-nineteenth century, the Turkish-speaking population gradually mixed with and Persian-speakers, especially in Tehran and suburban cities such as Karaj, and .

Among the Turkish-speaking population of Iran, Azerbaijanis are the least proficient in Persian. The Turkish composition of Tehran is estimated from about one-third to over half of the citie's population. This ratio, of around 6-7 million people, places Tehran in the first place among the densest Turkish habitation in Iran. Azerbaijanis alone comprised at least one-third of Iran's population in 1850. It is likely that this proportion has continued to increase as Iranian Azerbaijanis exhibit greater fertility in rural areas.

Plot.
Korean immigrant Amanda and her homeschooled daughter Chrissy “Chris” live on a rural farm, raising bees, selling honey, raising chickens, and living without modern technology as Amanda has an “allergic reaction” to electronics and electricity. She's upset to learn that Chrissy wants to leave the farm in order to pursue college, as Amanda had wanted her to remain on the farm. When Amanda receives the cremated ashes of her recently deceased estranged mother, who she called Umma, in a suitcase from her uncle visiting her from Korea, she is confronted with memories of her abusive childhood. 
Umma had been left to raise Amanda alone in the United States, unable to speak English and surrounded by those who did not understand or practice her culture. It is revealed that Amanda fabricated her “allergy” to electronics after being electrically shocked multiple times by Umma as punishment. When Amanda cut ties with her mother she also cut ties with her Korean heritage as a whole, including giving up her family name. As her uncle left, he shamed Amanda for abandoning her own mother and heritage, and for not teaching Chrissy Korean language and culture. 
Soon after the ashes arrive a vicious spirit appears, intent on claiming Amanda's body for itself. As the supernatural phenomena following the delivery of her mother’s ashes progress, from visions of tormented Korean spirits (including Umma’s spirit) to an encounter with a kumiho that was eating her chickens, Amanda suddenly becomes more paranoid and fearful that she’s slowly becoming her own mother. This fear becomes realized when Umma successfully possesses her daughter when Amanda tries to bury the ashes. 
Chrissy finds her mother performing the Jesa and wearing a mask and hanbok. She's attacked by Amanda, but manages to avoid being killed after pleading for her life. Amanda decides to confront her mother. She forgives her for the abuse. Amanda acknowledges that it was unfair that Umma had been expected to raise a child all alone in a country far from home and in her circumstances, but that it was not an excuse for the abuse. This compassion and understanding allows Umma to finally move on and be at peace, as she had also come to understand that what she did to Amanda was unfair. The film ends with Amanda rediscovering her family heritage and sharing it with her daughter, as well as coming to terms with Chrissy’s need to live her own life.

Amy Uyematsu (October 18, 1947 – June 23, 2023) was a Japanese American poet who has written six highly acclaimed poetry collections. 
Works.
Prominent writer Naomi Hirahara called Uyematsu, "One of LA's finest poets." Her writing mainly focused on the discrimination she experienced as both an Asian-American and a woman. Much of her early work explored the origins of the yellow power movement, which was a campaign inspired by the Black Power movement that worked towards equal rights for Asian Americans. Uyematsu won the Nicholas Roerich Poetry Prize for her first book, 30 Miles from J-Town, in 1992. She attended UCLA during the late 1960s and early 1970s, where she began writing poetry in response to anti-Asian racism in the U.S. that was largely caused by the ongoing Vietnam War. Uyematsu’s activism spurred her to help start up UCLA’s Asian American Studies Program immediately after her graduation. Her writing appeared in many anthologies and journals published internationally. Her essay from 1969, “The Emergence of Yellow Power in America,” has had a lasting impact on Asian-American studies across the country, through her criticism of social inequities: “Although the race situation in America is not strictly analogous to white colonialism and imperialism, the blacks and yellows have suffered similar consequences as Third World people at the hands of the American capitalist power.” Uyematsu was also an experienced educator and taught high school mathematics for over thirty years in Los Angeles.

She spent seven weeks in jail before facing the death penalty for violating Georgia's insurrection law. However, she was eventually released and the charges were dropped. She then became one of the leaders in the Lawrence textile strike where she organized protests against layoffs, pay cuts, and shortened hours. She earned the title the “Red Flame” at this time. In 1932, she led a group of 3,000 people from Rhode Island in the national Hunger March to Washington D.C. Shortly after, she became an official organizer for the National Textile Workers Union. She was granted the Wonder Woman Award by the Wonder Woman Foundation in 1982 and was later recognized by the Rhode Island Labor Society in 1990.

Sue Ko Lee (March 9, 1920 – May 15, 1996) was a labor organizer with the Chinese Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Association. 
In 1938, she joined the longest strike in San Francisco’s Chinatown's (at the time) history. This strike was a fifteen week long strike against the National Dollar Stores factory. Lee and the other workers who striked were tired of the low wages and poor working conditions they were given. They did not have many job options to choose from, so were forced to take the work they could get at the National Dollar Stores factory. This was because many white owned businesses would not hire them due to the fact that they were Chinese American. She helped organize and lead the strike and delivered speeches. The Dollar Store Strike was successful, in part due to her efforts. The workers got a 5 percent raise, and the conditions in which they were working also started to improve. This strike directly impacted the workers at the National Dollar Stores factories. In addition, after the company closed, more companies, even those that were previously made up of only white people, were willing to hire Chinese Americans. After the strike, Lee also became a leader of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union.

The interview and scrapbook helped give much of the currently known information about the strike. Lee died in El Cerrito, California on May 15, 1996.

Clara Lemlich Shavelson (March 28, 1886 - July 12, 1982) was a Jewish, Ukrainian labor activist. She helped organize the shirtwaist workers strike called the "Uprising of 20,000." 
Early life.
Clara Lemlich was born on March 28, 1886 in Gorodok, Ukraine. Lemlich’s parents were very religious Jews, which brought Clara into some tough situations later in life. In her early life Lemlich experienced many occurrences of Anti-Jew violence, as well as lack of education opportunities just because of her religion and gender. After being denied admission to a public school in Gorodok because she was Jewish, her parents banned her from reading, listening, or seeing anything Russian. Even though she had these restrictions, Lemlich continued to read these Russian books and continued to educate herself. 
As a child Lemlich experienced the many struggles of people living under the Russian Monarchy. Lemlich and her family fled Ukraine in 1903, and they worked very hard to find jobs and a new home. Many immigrants had a hard time finding jobs and having money, so many just joined the manufacturing workforce. Lemlich worked to make shirtwaists in unbelievable conditions with a very low wage. Shocked by this sexist environment, Lemlich joined the Uprising of 20,000 (also known as The New York shirtwaist strike of 1909), a strike against sexism in the workplace, horrible working conditions, unfair pay and hours, and much more. She continued to inspire many people, becoming a very important women's suffrage activist. 
In 1905, her family decided to move to The United States of America, specifically New York City. Lemlich decided she would be a passionate and fiery socialist with many opinions. Once in the states, Lemlich followed in the path of many other immigrants in need of work and joined a shirt and dress factory. Lemlich was very appalled by the horrid conditions of that factory and wrote about how the conditions for Men and Women were completely different, and the women were always given the worse option. She wrote about how the wage gap was insanely unfair, how the better work stations were given to men, and how the hours she worked and the amount she got paid were completely unfair. Lemlich decided to lead a strike, called The Uprising of 20,000 (or The New York shirtwaist strike of 1909) to strike against unbelievable unfair situations in the workplace. 
After this very well known strike, Lemlich became very well known. This led to many people having very mixed feelings about her. Although she did receive some hate because of her opinions, it never stopped Lemlich from doing what she believed was right. She continued being a socialist, and fought for many other important things, as well as helping to found and sustain the Wage Earner's League for Woman Suffrage. 
In 1913, Lemlich married printer's union activist Joe Shavelson, and proceeded to have 3 kids. In 1926, Lemlich joined the Communist Party USA, where she worked to create The United Council of Working Class Housewives, helping organize people and getting funding for many more strikes yet to come. Through the age of 58 Lemlich continued to speak at protests and strikes, about many topics including Women's Suffrage and Nuclear Weapons.

The brainfuck programming language is an esoteric (weird and unusual) programming language. It was created by Urban Müller in 1993. It has eight instructions (commands) which operate (do things on) a tape. Instructions are done one by one, in order. The tape has multiple sections. Each section is a number. Each section is, in the beginning, zero. Brainfuck is like a Turing machine. 
Examples.
If the current section is not zero, these three commands subtract one until the current section is zero. Otherwise, they leave it at zero. 
These five commands first add three to the current section. Then, they subtract two from the current section. Since formula_1, these five commands are the same as "+" alone. 
Derivatives.
As a result of brainfuck's fame, many derivatives (versions) of brainfuck have been created. These include Brain-Flak, pbrain, and tinyBF. Most are also Turing complete, just like brainfuck.

Stoke-upon-Trent is commonly called just "Stoke". 
Rather confusingly, it is just one of the six towns that make up the city of Stoke-on-Trent, in Staffordshire, England.
The other towns that make up Stoke-on-Trent are Hanley, Burslem, Fenton, Longton and Tunstall.

Hanley is one of the six towns that make up the city of Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire, England. The others are Burslem, Longton, Fenton, Tunstall and Stoke-upon-Trent.
Hanley has an important city centre. It has been for a long time the commercial hub of the city of Stoke-on-Trent. It is home to the Potteries Shopping Centre and many high street chain stores.
The Pottery towns are connected by double-carriageway roads, and have the M6 motorway nearby. Hanley no longer has a train link, but the canal which carried the goods is still active.
Hanley was a centre of the 1842 Pottery Riots, and part of the 1842 General Strike. This is a reminder that coal mining was as important as pottery in the area during the 19th century. Coal fired the huge kilns in which the clay objects were baked. Indeed coal was as important to potteries as the clay itself.
Both the pottery and the coal was moved by barge along canal waterways. It is still more efficient to move heavy cargo on water than any other way.

The Ahom kingdom (/ˈɑːhɔːm/, 1228–1826) was a late medieval kingdom in the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam. It maintained its sovereignty for nearly 600 years having successfully resisted Mughal expansion in Northeast India. Established by Sukaphaa, a Tai prince from Mong Mao (present-day Yunnan Province, China), it began as a mong in the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra based on wet rice agriculture. It expanded suddenly under Suhungmung in the 16th century and became multi-ethnic in character, casting a profound effect on the political and social life of the entire Brahmaputra valley. The kingdom became weaker with the rise of the Moamoria rebellion, and subsequently fell to repeated Burmese invasions of Assam. With the defeat of the Burmese after the First Anglo-Burmese War and the Treaty of Yandabo in 1826, control of the kingdom passed into East India Company hands.

The "Mongolian spot" is a clear bluishgrey mark on newborns back. It completely disappears at the age of 12-14 months. It is not so big as a penny in diameter. This is mainly due to the accumulation of melamine pigment in the dermis. This name was given mainly due to the fact that it was first discovered in Mongolian children. In fact, it is observed not only in people belonging to the Mongoloid race, but also in members of other races. These spots are found in 90% of Asian children. The "Mongolian spot" is also observed in the peoples of Europe. An example of this are the Roma people.

Warren Kenneth Paxton Jr. (born December 23, 1962) is an American lawyer and politician. He is the Attorney General of Texas since January 2015. He was Texas State Senator for the 8th district and the Texas State Representative for the 70th district. 
Paxton has been under indictment since 2015 on state securities fraud charges. He has pleaded not guilty. In October 2020, many public officials accused him of bribery.
After Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and Donald Trump did not accept losing while making false claims of election fraud, Paxton help Trump in his efforts to overturn the result. He filled the unsuccessful "Texas v. Pennsylvania" case in the Supreme Court. He spoke at the rally Trump held on January 6, 2021, that happened shortly before the 2021 United States Capitol attack.

The attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election was a political scheme made by then President Donald Trump, who lost the 2020 U.S. presidential election to his Democratic opponent Joe Biden, the former U.S. vice president. 
Trump did not accept his defeat and claimed the election was rigged and had voter fraud. This was an effort to overturn the election, with support and assistance from his campaign, proxies, political allies, and many of his supporters. 
Many unsuccessful lawsuits were filed to change the election results in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin and Michigan. Efforts to change the election results caused the 2021 United States Capitol attack, which was widely described as an attempted coup d'état.
False claims.
Trump and his allies called the election a "big lie" based on false claims and conspiracy theories claiming that the election was stolen by rigged voting machines, electoral fraud and an international communist conspiracy. Trump, The Proud Boys and QAnon spread fake information on social media saying the election was rigged and stolen.
These allegations were not proven and were tossed out by many state and federal judges, election officials, governors, and government agencies. On December 1, 2020, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said U.S. attorneys and FBI agents had investigated complaints and allegations of fraud, but found none of significance. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said no evidence had been found of other countries trying to hack the election. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Chris Krebs called the election "the most secure in American history", which caused Trump to fire him. Trump attorney Joseph diGenova wanted Krebs to be executed.
Response.
Many elected Republicans, including members of Congress and governors, did not want to say that Biden won the election fairly. Many of Trump's supporters would protest the election results by chanting "Stop the Steal". Emily Murphy, the administrator of the General Services Administration, delayed the start of the presidential transition until sixteen days after most media outlets had called Biden the winner. Former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn wanted Trump to suspend the United States Constitution, force martial law, silence the press, and hold a new election under military supervision.
Attempts.
A small group of Trump supporters, including Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows and several Republican lawmakers from the House Freedom Caucus, tried to keep Trump in power. They wanted state legislatures to force a Trump win and change the electoral vote certification at the Capitol for favor Trump. Trump and his allies wanted state officials to throw out legally cast ballots, challenge vote-certification processes, and overturn certified election results. In an early January 2021 phone call, he wanted the Georgia secretary of state to "find" the 11,780 votes needed to win his victory in the state. He also wanted Georgia Governor Brian Kemp to create a special session of the legislature to overturn Biden's certified victory in the state. He wanted the Pennsylvania state government to do the same. Trump asked 300 Republican state legislators to look for ways to reverse the election results in their states.
Lawsuits.
Trump wanted Justice Department leaders to challenge the election results and publicly state the election was corrupt. His legal team wanted a path to bring a case before the United States Supreme Court, but none of the 63 lawsuits they filed were successful. Many of these lawyers hoped that the "Texas v. Pennsylvania" would work, but on December 11, 2020, the Supreme Court said they would not hear that case.
Possible military action.
After the failure of "Texas", Trump thought about a military intervention, taking voting machines and another appeal to the Supreme Court, as well as challenging the congressional counting of the electoral votes on January 6, 2021.
Electoral college certification.
By December 30, 2020, many Republican members of the House and Senate said they would try to force both chambers to debate whether to certify the Electoral College results. Mike Pence, who as vice president would be in charge over the proceedings. He supported this by saying on January 4, "I promise you, come this Wednesday, we will have our day in Congress." Trump and some supporters promoted a false "Pence card" theory that, even if Congress were to certify the results, the vice president would have the power to reject them.
On the day of the electoral certification, supporters of Trump, attacked the United States Capitol to try to overturn the election, with some calling it an attempted coup d'état. One week later, Trump was impeached a second time for incitement of insurrection but was acquitted by the Senate. Depending on the findings of the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, which is expected to release its report in 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice may decide to investigate whether Trump committed a crime.
Aftermath.
After the vote certification, some Republicans changed their opinion to say Biden won the election. However, some continued to support Trump's claims. , Trump has publicly continued to insist that the election was stolen. Although Trump has said he lost the election to a group of historians in , saying, "We had a deal all set [until the election was lost and] the deal went away." Trump supporters continue attempts to overturn the results, pushing for state legislature resolutions and new lawsuits.

The U.S. House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol is a select committee of the U.S. House of Representatives to investigate the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. The attack, inspired by President Donald Trump's false claim of a stolen election, was an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results, in which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden.
Creation.
The committee was formed through a party-line vote on July 1, 2021 with Democrats supporting it and a majority of Republicans going against it. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger were the only two House Republicans to be on the committee, and the Republican National Committee eventually censured them for their participation.
Investigations.
The investigation started with public hearings on July 27, when four police officers testified. By March 2022, the committee had interviewed nearly 700 people. Steve Bannon, Mark Meadows, Peter Navarro, and Dan Scavino have been held in criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to testify; Bannon was indicted by a federal grand jury. Other members of Trump's inner circle are working with the committee.
Purpose.
The committee has argued that Trump knew he did not win the election and was committing fraud, and it may recommend that the U.S. Department of Justice open a criminal investigation into Trump's responsibility for the attack on the Capitol. However, the Justice Department already has its own inquiries and investigations, the committee may instead focus on creating its final report.

Texas v. Pennsylvania, 592 U.S. ___ (2020), was a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court saying that the 2020 presidential election in certain states were rigged and that Joe Biden did not beat President Donald Trump. This was one of the many attempts by Trump to overturn the election results.
The case was filed by Texas State Attorney General Ken Paxton on December 8, 2020. "Texas v. Pennsylvania" said that Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin violated the United States Constitution by changing election rules through non-legislative means. Three days later, the United States Supreme Court said they will not hear the case thus ending the lawsuit.
Purpose.
This case was filed by Trump supporters to stop the certified vote count from these four states before the Electoral College vote on December 14. The suit was filed after about 90 lawsuits from disputes over the election results filed by Trump and the Republican Party had failed in many state and federal courts.
Creation.
The suit had been created by a team of lawyers with ties to the Trump presidential campaign. Paxton agreed to file the case after other state attorneys general declined to do so. The Solicitor General of Texas Kyle D. Hawkins did not support the suit and refused to let his name be added.
Within one day of Texas's filing, Trump, over 100 Republican Representatives, and 18 Republican state attorneys general filed motions to support the case. Trump called this case as "the big one" of the election-challenging lawsuits. Many who were against this case urged the Court to refuse the case, with Pennsylvania's brief calling it a "seditious abuse of the judicial process". Many legal experts did not believe this case would be successful to Trump.
Supreme Court decision.
The Supreme Court said on December 11, 2020 that they would not hear the case because there was no "legal standing" to challenge the results of the election held by another state.

A depression is a long period of time in which the economy of a country is not working well. It is usually marked by a large number of people being without jobs. A depression is a more severe kind of recession. A depression can last for several years. In addition to high unemployment, depressions hurt banks, trade and manufacturing. Prices fall, credit is harder to get and there is an increase in bankruptcies. 
A depression in one country can quickly spread to other countries. For example the Panic of 1873 started in Vienna and spread to other parts of Europe and to America, bringing what was called "the Great Depression" until a worse one came in 1929.
The Great Depression.
The Great Depression (1929-39) was the longest lasting and deepest economic depression in the history of the modern industrial world. It started after the U.S. stock market crash in 1929. The prices on the Wall Street stock market fell from October 24 to October 29, 1929. It sent Wall Street into a panic. Millions of investors were financially ruined. By 1933 nearly half the banks in the United States had failed and between 13 and 15 million Americans were unemployed. The beginnings of World War II in Europe ended the depression. The Great Depression affected countries worldwide. Unlike previous depressions in which a few countries were hurt, the Great Depression was felt by nearly all industrialized countries. Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North and South America all suffered. Countries tried to protect their own economies by raising tariffs on goods they imported into their countries. This caused world trade to fall by some 30 percent. An estimated 30 million people were unemployed worldwide by 1932. 
The Great Depression had far-reaching political consequences. As economies failed some people looked to military dictators to save their countries. For example, countries like Argentina and several in Central America had dictators. In Germany, Italy and Japan, Fascism took hold which directly led to World War II. In the Soviet Union the depression allowed Joseph Stalin to come to power. He exiled millions to labor camps and began a reign of terror called the Great Purge. As many as 20 million Soviets died in the 1930s alone. In the west, one response was Welfare Capitalism. This took hold in countries such as Canada, France and Great Britain.
Signs of a depression.
As of 2013, some countries in Europe were suffering greater unemployment than they did during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Gross domestic product has been shrinking faster than some European nations can cut spending. Europe's financial crisis shows every sign of getting worse, not better. While called a recession by some government officials, economists are already calling it a depression. As European countries are locked into the Euro they cannot devalue their own currency to adjust their economies. This means they cannot lower the price of their exports to make them more attractive and so cannot achieve a balance of trade.

Goofy and Wilbur is an animated cartoon short. It was made by Walt Disney Productions. It was released by RKO Radio Pictures on March 17, 1939. It was the first cartoon with Goofy in a solo role without either Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck.
In this cartoon Goofy goes fishing with his pet grasshopper, Wilbur. They have nothing but bad luck. The smarter dog, Goofy, and his dumb insect friend catch fish in a fishing net using Wilbur as bait. This cartoon shows a lot of violence, because Wilbur is nearly, or perhaps actually, killed.
The cartoon is known for its 13 slapstick adventures during the eight minutes of action. It was released two years after "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (1937) and a year before "Pinocchio" and "Fantasia" (both in 1940).
Plot.
Goofy and his friend Wilbur, a tame grasshopper, team up for a fishing expedition. Goofy decides to use Wilber as bait, but he realizes too late that his friend might actually get eaten by a fish. Goofy has a boat he is rowing and a net, but no fishing rod. Wilbur, being a live bug, becomes the perfect choice for bait inside their fishing net, which will attract the fish as food.
Wilber's life depends on Goofy to save the little bug, who becomes the bait for a half-dozen fish. As Wilber gets tricked again and again, he is at last swallowed by a frog; then that frog gets eaten by a stork, all while Goofy desperately attempts a chasing rescue. In the end Wilbur hatches out of the stork egg, and to Goofy's relief, seems okay. It is not explained how Wilber ended up in the egg of the stork. One blog writer says: "I wonder if Goofy has had a psychotic break at the end of the cartoon, and the reappearance of Wilbur is simply a delusion."

The Peak District is an upland area in England at the southern end of the Pennines. It is mostly in northern Derbyshire but also includes parts of Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Staffordshire and Yorkshire.
The area has two main parts. The northern 'Dark Peak' is where most of the moorland is found. Its geology is gritstone. The southern 'White Peak' is where most of the population lives: its geology is mainly limestone.
Much of the area is uplands above , with a high point on Kinder Scout of . Despite its name, the landscape generally lacks sharp peaks, but has rounded hills and gritstone escarpments (the "edges"). The area is surrounded by major conurbations, including Huddersfield, Manchester, Sheffield, Derby and Stoke-on-Trent.
The area is very difficult to travel across. The roads are few and narrow. This is due to the terrain, which is hilly, rough and uneven. Major motorways run east and west of the area.
The Peak District National Park became the first national park in the United Kingdom in 1951. It attracts many visitors every year.
Geology.
The Peak District is formed almost exclusively from sedimentary rocks dating from the Carboniferous period. They comprise the Carboniferous limestone, the overlying gritstone and finally the coal measures at the margins of the area. There are outcrops of igneous rocks including lavas, tuffs and volcanic vent agglomerates. The Peak District is like a broad dome (see image below).
Earth movements after the Carboniferous period resulted in the up-doming of the area. This resulted in the dome-like shape. The shale and sandstone were worn away until limestone was exposed. At the end of this period, the Earth's crust sank here which led to the area being covered by sea, depositing a variety of new rocks.
Some time after its deposition, mineral veins were formed in the limestone. These veins and rakes have been mined for lead since Roman times.
The Peak District was covered by ice during at least one of the ice ages of the last 2 million years. Glacial meltwaters eroded a complex of sinuous channels along the margin of the Peak District during this period. Glacial meltwaters helped form many of the caves in the limestone area. Wild animal herds roamed the area, and their remains have been found in several of the local caves.
The different types of rock that lie beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape. They determine the vegetation and so the animals that will live in the area. Limestone has fissures (cracks) and is soluble in water, so rivers carve deep, narrow valleys. These rivers then often find a route underground, creating cave systems. Millstone Grit on the other hand is insoluble but porous, so it absorbs water. Water moves through the grits until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs when it reaches the surface again. The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost. They form areas where landslides may occur, as on Mam Tor.

Finsterhennen () is a municipality in the administrative district of Seeland in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the part of the Federal government of the United States responsible for collecting taxes and enforcing tax laws. The IRS decides how much tax is owed and collects the revenue on a regular basis. The IRS is the largest bureau in the United States Department of the Treasury. It is one of the world's most efficient tax collection agencies. The IRS processed over 224 million tax forms and collected over $2 trillion in revenue in 2004. 
The IRS collects taxes in advance by withholding them through employers. Individuals who overpay through tax withholding are issued refunds after they file their income tax return. In 2006 the Seattle Times reported that up to 11.6 million refunds were not paid back because the IRS suspected fraud. According to the Seattle Times the affected taxpayers were not informed of the reason for not getting their refund. Many or most of the people who were not issued refunds were low-income individuals
History.
Beginning in 1791, the federal government was supported by taxes on distilled beverages, tobacco, sugar, corporate bonds and slaves. These were indirect taxes, the only kind permitted by the United States Constitution. In 1812, the cost of the war added the first sales taxes on gold, jewelry, and silverware. In 1817, the government did away with all these taxes and relied on the funds from tariffs on imported goods.
During the American Civil War, funds were needed to finance the war. In 1861, Congress drafted a bill for a direct tax on personal and corporate income. This first income tax charged 3% on incomes over $800. The bill passed both houses of Congress but never went into effect. In 1862, however, Abraham Lincoln signed a bill that called for a 3% tax on incomes between $600 and $5,000, 7.5% on incomes between $5,000 and $10,000 and 10% on incomes over $10,000. There were debates in Congress over the constitutionality of the direct income tax, but no action was taken. It was allowed to expire in 1872 when it came up for renewal.
In 1862, Congress had authorized the office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Much as today, he had the power to assess, levy and collect taxes. He also had the right to enforce the tax laws by prosecution and seizing property and income. George S. Boutwell was the first commissioner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.
In 1894, Congress passed the Wilson-Gorman Tariff. It reduced the Tariffs on certain imports into the United States. However, it made up for this by charging a 2% direct income tax. The Supreme Court, in "Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co" ruled the income tax unconstitutional a year later. The Court ruled that the Constitution did not allow an income tax without apportionment among the states.
On February 3, 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified. Free of the critical apportionment issue, it allowed Congress to impose an income tax. The Bureau of the IRS was charged with collecting income taxes. Personal income tax was 1% on income above $3,000. Incomes over $5,000 were subject to an additional 6% tax. Income taxes were as high as 77% in 1918 to help finance World War I. In 1929 they dropped to a high of 24% but rose again during the Great Depression in 1929. During World War II withholding and quarterly taxes were introduced. 
In 1953, the Bureau of Internal Revenue reorganized and changed its name to the Internal Revenue Service. 
In 1998, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act again reorganized and modernized the agency. Taxpayer rights were further expanded.
The current Commissioner of Internal Revenue is Charles P. Rettig.

The Last Judgment is a fresco by Toma din Suceava at the Moldovita Monastery in Romania. The name of the work in Romanian is "Judecata de Apoi".
"The Last Judgment" covers the west wall of the monastery. It shows the day of judgment with a river of fire and the dead coming out of the sea. Prince Mohammed is one of the heretics. There are 105 paintings of angels near the roof.
The Moldovita Monastery also has famous frescos of the "Siege of Constantinople" and the "Tree of Jesse", showing Christ's genealogy.
Prince Rares and the artists.
The Moldovita Monastery is a UNESCO site. It was started in 1532 by Prince Petru Rares, the illegitimate son of Stephen the Great. It was built on the location of an old stone church built by Alexandru cel Bun (1400-1432). The old church fell in the early 16th century because of rain and landslides.
Petru Rares ruled Moldavia between 1527-1538 and 1541-1546. He had new ideas for the churches in Bukovina. Rares hired artists to cover the walls of the churches with complicated designs of saints, prophets, and scenes from the life of Jesus.
The best preserved monasteries are in Sucevita, Moldovita, Voronet, Humor, Suceava, Pătrăuţi, and Probota. Seven monasteries were put on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1993. The Moldovita Monastery was consecrated to the Annunciation (Romanian: "Bunei Vestiri") on March 25. It is one of five monasteries in northern Moldavia with frescoes painted on the outside walls.
The monastery is in the style of Moldavian Gothic architecture. It combines Gothic and Byzantine elements. It is a Romanian Orthodox monastery.
The Moldoviţa frescoes were completed by Toma of Suceava in 1537. Toma of Suceava's painting is in the Italian Renaissance style, with humanized characters.
The Last Judgment in art.
The theme of death is a common subject for religious art, but the frescos in the monasteries in northern Moldavia are special. These frescos are more complex than art in other areas of the former Byzantine Empire. The Moldovan work was a model for Mount Athos.
The oldest image of the Last Judgment is from the seventh century CE. It is in the "Christian Topography" of Cosmas Indicopleustes. The manuscript is in the Vatican library. The first known frightening picture of the Judgment in fresco are from 1075. They are in the church "San Angelo in Formis" near Naples. The oldest mosaic with this theme is in Venice, in the church of Torcello. It is probably from the twelfth century.

Emergency medical services (EMS), also known as ambulance services or paramedic services, are agencies that deal with medical emergencies, mostly by sending ambulances or other vehicles to help people who are severely ill or injured. Their job is to treat these people at the incident and to take them to a hospital if needed. There are several types types of staffing. Most Ambulances and other medical vehicles have personnel who provide Advanced levels of Emergency Medical Care. This is called Advanced Life Support (ALS). Sometimes it is called Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS). Some ambulances or other medical vehicles also have staff with more basic training,and they are known as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs). They provide Basic levels of Emergency Medical Care. This is called Basic Life Support (BLS). Sometimes there are both on Ambulances. Doctors sometimes assist with care.
The exact role of the emergency medical services varies by country. In some countries like the US and UK, their job is seen as bringing the patients from an incident to treatment. Until the 1970s, their ambulances carried patients to hospital and gave them little medical care. Since then, paramedics have been trained to give some medical care before they get to hospital. Other countries like France and Germany run them in a different way, where their job is seen as bringing treatment to the patients. In those countries, doctors work on ambulances and they try to treat patients at the scene rather than take them to the hospital.
The type of organization that provides emergency medical services also varies by country. This may be:

Sigismund II Augustus (1520-1572) was a Polish king, the last member of the Jagiellon dynasty. He was also the Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1548 to 1572.
Biography.
Sigismund II Augustus was born in Kraków on 1 August 1520. He was the only son (he had sisters) of king Sigismund I the Old and his wife, Italian princess Bona Sforza. His great grandfather was Wladislaw II Jagiello, the founder of the dynasty. Sigismund II Augustus was crowned as a child on 20 February 1530 when his father was still alive (in Latin "vivente rege"). From 1544 he ruled in Lithuania. He was married three times but remained childless. He died on 7 July 1572 in Knyszyn. He was a Roman Catholic, but was known for his tolerance for Protestants.
When king Sigismund II Augustus received diplomats or made important decisions, he did so in the audience hall in the royal castle. This room was also called "Under the Heads" for the carved heads set in the ceiling. One of these was a woman's head. The legend says whenever he would make a decision she would speak in Latin (using rhyme and alliteration): "Rex Auguste, iudica iuste" ("King August, judge justly"). He followed her advice but after that her mouth was covered with a ribbon so she would never again interfere in royal decisions.

Autophagy (which means "eating itself"), is one of the basic cell mechanisms. It allows the controlled breaking down of cell parts which do not work, or are not needed. The cell parts can then be recycled as required. 
There are several ways this happens. Targeted cell parts may be isolated from the rest of the cell in an "autophagosome" (a double-membraned vesicle). The autophagosome fuses with lysosomes and the contents are broken down and recycled. In the extreme case of starvation, the breakdown of cellular components promotes cellular survival by maintaining cellular energy levels.
The name "autophagy" was coined by Belgian biochemist Christian de Duve in 1963. The identification of autophagy-related genes in yeast in the 1990s let researchers figure out the mechanisms of autophagy. This led to the award of the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Japanese researcher Yoshinori Ohsumi.

The Great Green Wall of Africa is a strip of trees being planted across Africa to stop the Sahara desert from moving south. The Sahara desert moving south is affecting countries such as: Niger, Chad, Sudan, Mali and many more. The expansion of desert areas may affect the lives of up to 19 million people, including more than 1 million children. 
The strip of trees is planned to be about 15 kilometers wide. 
Unfortunately some people, when they see these trees, gather wood as timber for them to make fire or other uses.

The Lluta is a river in the Atacama Desert. It is the most northern of the great transversal Chilean rivers that start in the Andes and flow into the Pacific Ocean. It flows through the Arica y Parinacota region.
It has a broad estuary near the port city of Arica that forms a wetland, a habitat used by many water birds (birds that live on or near water).
Geography.
The Lluta river has a length of , and a drainage basin with an area of approximately .
Course.
The Lluta river starts on the Andean mountain slopes near the border with Peru and Bolivia, at an elevation of about , in the place called "Humapalca", "comuna" of General Lagos, Parinacota province, Arica y Parinacota.
The river is formed by the confluence of two streams:
Along its first , the river flows southeast and then slowly begins to turn towards the west. In its descent to the lower elevations of the valley, the river starts to run through a canyon formed by the same river; in some parts, the canyon could be deep.
Near the village of "Socoroma" (in the "comuna" of Putre), the river turns directly west and, after getting out of the canyon, the river begins to widen. Near the village of "Chironta", about from the sea, appear the first farms.
Finally, the river flows in the Pacific Ocean north of the city of Arica, in the sector Chacalluta, near the airport.
The Lluta river only flows through small villages except Putre, a small town with only 1,977 inhabitants (2022 census).
Wetland of the Lluta river.
The mouth of the Lluta river in the Pacific Ocean covers more of . The resulting coastal wetland is the most important of its kind in the region with extensive vegetation and many water birds, including migratory birds.
Main tributaries.
Because the Lluta river flows throug a very arid region, the Atacama desert, there are very few permanent tributaries, and most of them join the Luta by its left side; some of them are Allane, Putre, Socoroma and Colpitas.
Water quality.
Apart from its problems of salinity and acidity, the river has very high levels of boron, arsenic, and sulfate, among other pollutants, which limit the agricultural activities that can be developed along the river.

Research and development (R&amp;D) refers to a wide range of activities by businesses, governments and academic institutions designed to gather knowledge and test new ideas. This often leads to the development of new products or new ways of doing things. R&amp;D generally has three main activities. These are: basic research, applied research and development. Basic research is aimed at getting new knowledge with no immediate use or purpose in mind. Applied research is just the opposite. It is research for a definite purpose or product. Development has more to do with adding features to a product. Often, development is a process of eliminating all but the best idea to arrive at the best solution. Basic and applied research costs are often written off as expenses while the costs of development are added to the cost of the product. R&amp;D often results in owning intellectual property such as patents. In Europe, R&amp;D is called research and technical/technological development (RTD). 
In 2015, Volkswagen was the world's leading spender in R&amp;D

Mary Sidney (1561-1621) was an English poet. She was the sister of more famous poet Philip Sidney.

Thus she became Countess of Pembroke. She had four children, Katherine, Anne, William and Philip. She died of smallpox in London on 25 September 1621. She is buried in the cathedral in Salisbury.
Works.
Mary Sidney was a poet and translator. She translated 107 Psalms, using 128 different verse forms.

Iambic pentameter is a kind of verse. It is the most common kind of verse in English literature.
The two words seem difficult, because the words are Greek. "Pentameter" means "consisting of five measures" and "iambic" "consisting of iambs".
The rhythm which words make in the line is measured in small groups of syllables called "feet". The word "iambic" refers to the type of foot that is used, known as the "iamb". This is an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. The word "pentameter" indicates that a line has five of these "feet".
In theory every line is composed of ten syllables and have five stresses. Stresses fall on the second, the fourth, the sixth, the eighth and the tenth syllable. This is marked with two signs. The sign "x" stands for a syllable with no stress, and the sign "/" stands for a syllable with stress. So a line of iambic pentameter is:
Use in poetry.
In real poems lines have often an extra syllable at the end and sometimes lack the first unaccented syllable. A line can be divided in five units that are called "feet". The unit x / is called an "iamb" or "iambic foot". Sometimes the pattern is changed. First foot can be reversed: / x x / x / x / x /.
When iambic pentameter is unrhymed it is called blank verse. Blank verse was introduced into English poetry by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. Thomas Kyd used it in his "The Spanish Tragedy".
There are no rhymes in blank verse, but alliteration often occurs in it, for example "prime and pride".
William Shakespeare's dramas are written chiefly in blank verse. The first line of the famous Hamlet's monologue is an example:
Examples.
John Milton used blank verse in Paradise Lost. Many other poets (for example Edwin Atherstone, John Fitchett, Alfred Tennyson, Robert Browning and Matthew Arnold employed it long poems. John Fitchett's "King Alfred" is perhaps the longest epic poem written in blank verse. It consists of more than 130 000 lines. But Alexander Pope wrote iambic pentameter with rhymes. One line rhymes with the next. It is called heroic couplet.
Dramatic monologues are usually written in blank verse. Good examples are Tennyson's "St Simeon Stylites" and "Ulysses" or Browning's "The Ring and the Book". Robert Frost wrote similar poems in the United States.
Lines of iambic pentameter can be set also into stanzas. An example of a stanza is rhyme royal that consists of seven lines and rhymes ababbcc. It was used by Emma Lazarus in the poem "Sympathy" from the sequence "Epochs".
Iambic pentameter is used also in English sonnets.
The rhythm of iambic pentameter is close to the rhythm of everyday English speech. Iambic pentameter is common in German literature, too. This example is from "The Flamingos" by Rainer Maria Rilke:

Dame Enid Muriel Lyons AD, GBE (née Burnell; 9 July 1897 – 2 September 1981) was an Australian politician. She was the first woman to be elected to the Australian House of Representatives and the first woman in the federal Cabinet. She was the wife of the Premier of Tasmania and later Prime Minister of Australia, Joseph Lyons.
Lyons was born Enid Muriel Burnell in Smithton, Tasmania, one of three daughters of William and Eliza (née Taggett) Burnell. She trained to be a teacher in Hobart. Her mother was active in the Labor party and community groups in Tasmania. She was one of the first women appointed as a Justice of the Peace in Tasmania.
Lyons was made a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the Coronation Honours of 1937.[4][5] Joseph Lyons died in 1939, aged 59, the first Australian Prime Minister to die in office, and Dame Enid returned to Tasmania. She bitterly resented Joseph Lyons's successor as leader of the UAP, Robert Menzies, who had, she believed, betrayed her husband by resigning from the Cabinet, shortly before Joseph's death.[1]
At the 1943 election Dame Enid Lyons narrowly won the Division of Darwin in north-western Tasmania for the UAP, becoming the first woman in the House of Representatives. Her Labor opponent, who received more primary votes than she did, was the future Tasmanian Premier Eric Reece. At the same election, Dorothy Tangney was elected as a Labor Senator for Western Australia, the nation's first woman Senator.
In retirement, Dame Enid's health recovered. She was a newspaper columnist (1951–54), a commissioner of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1951–62), and remained active in public life promoting family and women's issues. She published three volumes of memoirs, which embarrassed the Liberal Party by reviving her complaints about Menzies' 1939 behaviour towards her husband.[1]
She was nevertheless made a Dame of the Order of Australia (AD) on Australia Day 1980,[8] the second woman to receive this honour. She was the first Australian woman to receive damehoods in different orders. She died the following year and was accorded a state funeral inDevonport, Tasmania, before being buried next to her husband at Mersey Vale Lawn Cemetery.[1]

Lucrezia Marinella (or Marinelli, 1571-1653) was an Italian poet.
She was born in Venice. Her father, named Giovanni Marinelli was a physician, so was her brother, Curzio Marinelli. Nothing is known however about her mother. The social position of the family enabled her to learn. She married Girolamo Vacca, who was also a physician.
Marinella wrote many works. She is widely known as the author of "La nobiltà et l'eccellenza delle donne co' diffetti et mancamenti de gli uomini" ("The Nobility and Excellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men", 1600). Her greatest work is an epic poem "L'Enrico ovvero Bisanzio acquistato". At that time the genre of epic poem was regarded as suitable for only men. Lucrezia Marinella proved that a woman can write a heroic poem. The poem is written in ottava rima which is considered to be a difficult form. It was translated into English by Maria Galli Stampino.
Lucrezia Marinella lived long for her time period. She died of malaria in Venice on 9 October 1653. She was buried in the church of S. Pantalone.

ECA may refer to:

An educational technologist is someone trained in the field of educational technology. Educational technologists try to analyze, design, develop, implement and evaluate processes and tools to make learning easier. The term does not necessarily, or even mainly, refer to hardware. The most significant ideas came from applied psychology and programmed learning.
There are various other terms which are alternatives, most obviously 'instructional technologist'. There have been various names for institutions specialising in the activity. The description used originally at the UK Open University was 'Applied Educational Sciences', changed later to 'Institute of Educational Technology'. To produce the landmark program "Sesame Street", the Childrens' Television Workshop employed applied psychologists to pre-test all programs. This was a typical activity for educational technologists even if they were not called by that name.

The United States Life-Saving Service (USLSS) was a United States government agency that grew out of concerns for saving the lives of shipwrecked sailors and ship's passengers. The federal life-saving service was established on June 28, 1848 as an agency of the United States Department of the Treasury. In 1915, the USLSS merged with the United States Revenue Cutter Service to form the United States Coast Guard.
Background.
Large areas of the Atlantic coast of the United States were relatively unpopulated during the 18th and 19th centuries. Any ship that ran aground, even within sight of land, could not expect much help. Even if people saw a ship in trouble they did not have organizations or the equipment to go out and rescue those who were in trouble. Even in places like New York Harbor ships could run aground on sandbars during storms and not have anyone to help them. In a storm a ship caught on a sandbar could be broken into pieces in just hours. Some survivors might be able to swim to shore, but in winter they could die from hypothermia before anyone might find and help them. An example was the American sailing ship "Mexico". In 1837 it ran aground on the New Jersey coast and before anyone knew of the wreck, all 112 passengers had died.
History.
There were early organizations that provided life-saving services in certain areas. For instance, in 1786, the Massachusetts Humane Society was formed by a number of Boston citizens who were concerned over the needless loss of life from shipwrecks in the area. They started the first lifeboat station at Cohasset, Massachusetts in 1807. These stations were small sheds that held the small boats and equipment that volunteers could use to rescue mariners. The society had recognized that only small boats were useful for life-saving since larger boats risked being shipwrecked as well. But the early sheds were only placed near busy ports and large areas of the coast remained unprotected.
On 14 August, 1848, Congress approved s for equipment for volunteers to provide life-saving rescues on the coastlines of New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts. Some funds went to the Massachusetts Humane Society because of their leadership in providing rescues for shipwreck victims. In 1850, a lifeboat station was built in Rhode Island and others were built in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Texas. In 1854, Congress approved $12,500 for metal surfboats for use in the Great Lakes. While Congress was providing funds from time to time, the efforts to save shipwrecked crews was still largely unorganized. Lifeboat stations and equipment were not kept up. Some equipment was stolen while the buildings were suffering from neglect and the effects of the weather on the shorelines. When the ship "Powhattan" was lost on April 16, 1852 and over 200 people died, the wreck happened just from a lifeboat station. To make matters worse, the bodies that washed up on shore were robbed of their belongings and left there. This got Congress to begin thinking about creating a federal life-saving service. In 1854 they began to take actions toward creating such a service. But progress on the idea stalled during the American Civil War.
The 1870 Atlantic hurricane season caused widespread destruction and casualties on a large scale. There was an national call for Congress to do something. Sumner Increase Kimball was an attorney who had joined the United States Department of the Treasury in 1862. In 1871 he was appointed to head the Life-Saving Bureau. Under his leadership the service was extended to the West Coast and the Great Lakes.
At this time there were two ways to save people in the water. One, which was used if the ship was close, was to rig a breeches buoy, a device on a rope used to pull someone to safety. The other method was to use a boat to row out through the surf to reach victims. Boats at this time were around long and were partially covered to keep water out. Crews often rowed through waves that were higher than the length of their boats. In about 1907, the boats began using gasoline-powered engines.
On January 28, 1915, the U.S. Coast Guard was formed by combining the Revenue Cutter Service with the Life-Saving Service. The law provided retirement of Kimball and many of the services' older employees. During its 44 year existence, the Life-Saving Service provided help to 28,121 ships and 178,741 people. During this time only 1,455 people lost their lives in rescues or attempted rescues by the USLSS.

A Moon landing is the arrival of a spacecraft on the surface of the Moon. It is a follow up to Project Mercury. This includes both crewed and uncrewed (robotic) missions. The first man-made object to reach the surface of the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 mission, on 13 September 1959.
The United States' Apollo 11 was the first crewed mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969. There have been six missions with people onboard that landed on the Moon between 1969 and 1972. There were also numerous landings without people onboard, with no soft landings happening from 22 August 1976 until 14 December 2013.
To date, the United States is the only country to have successfully landed humans on the Moon. The last mission was in December, 1972, and the last human to walk on the Moon was Gene Cernan.

Xu Zhimo (; Pronunciation: Hsü Chih-mo, 1897-1931) was a Chinese poet. Influenced by western poetries, his romantic work style was a great contribution to modern Chinese literature. His poetry is usually about love, beauty and freedom.
Biography.
Early life.
Xu Zhimo was originally given the name Zhangxu when he was born on January 15th, 1895. He was the only child from a rich family in Xiashi town, China. Though Zhimo’s father had always wanted him to either become a successful businessman or a scholar, Zhimo had shown interest in nature since he was a child. He started studying at age of five, which was early at that time. His teachers considered him an intelligent, clever, and active student.
Later on, in Hangzhou Secondary School, he not only had excellent academic performance but also made many friends whom they shared the same interest ― writing. That was also when Zhimo started to show his great writing ability. Right after his first marriage in 1915, Zhimo continued his study in Tianjin University. There he met Liang Qichao, a well-known Chinese writer who first encouraged him to go study in the U.S.
Study &amp; Career.
Xu Zhimo went to the U.S. to accomplish his education in 1918. He first studied history in Clark University, and then transferred to Cornell and Columbia Universities for economics in 1919. During the time in Columbia University, he wrote articles about social issues and political science. In 1920, he left for London School of Economics and Political Science because he wanted to study with Bertrand Russell and Harold Laski, the two philosopher and theorist whom he really admired. Later he went to King’s College, Cambridge, where he was influenced by English poets such as Keats and Shelley. Being taught by Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, it was when Zhimo started working on poetries that showed influence of English romantic literature. Before returning to China, Zhimo had translated some English and French romantic works into Chinese.  
In China, he put most of his efforts on producing poetries, in which he combined western romantic elements and modern Chinese forms. He published a monthly magazine “Goal”, which was to encourage Chinese people to achieve their goals. With Liang Qichao and Hu Shi, Zhimo formed a poetry society, “The Crescent Moon Society”. Their modern work style and the everyday language tone in their works were huge breakthroughs in Chinese literature. 
In the last few years of his life he was editors in several bookstores and professors in many universities. 
Love Life.
Xu Zhimo, throughout his life, was pursuing beauty, freedom and love. In search of true love, there were three especially important women ― Zhang Youyi, Lin Huiyin and Lu Xiaoman, who influenced both Zhimo’s life and works.
By the time Zhimo graduated from Hangzhou Secondary School in 1915, his father arranged his marriage with Zhang Youyi, which was a Chinese tradition that Zhimo tried to get rid of. Later while he was studying at Cambridge University in 1920, he met Lin Huiyin, who was also influenced by western culture and English romantic literature. They fell in love and that was when Zhimo was able to produce many romantic poetries about love.
Zhimo then divorced with Zhang Youyi in 1922. However, Lin Huiyin decided to go back to China and marry Liang Qichao’s son, Liang Sicheng. In order to search for Huiyin, Zhimo returned to China. He met Lu Xiaoman in Beijing and they were both impressed by each other’s talents and knowledge. They soon fell in love with each for several years and got married in 1926 and lived happily for the first few years. However, when Xiaoman became wasteful, Zhimo had to teach in two universities to sustain the expenditure. That was also when Zhimo’s production in poems decreased.
Death.
On November 19th, 1931, Zhimo took a plane from Beijing to Nanjing in order to attend Lin Huiyin’s speech. During the flight the plane crashed into the hills near Jinan because of the thick fog. Zhimo died at the age of 35.
Works, Style and Influence.
Xu Zhimo was the leader of modern Chinese poetry movement. He was one of the pioneers who combined modern and romantic elements in Chinese poetry. Influenced by western forms, his romantic works broke old Chinese literary forms. In his short life, Zhimo translated many English poems, published four poetry anthologies, four collections of essays, and many significant poetries. Also, as editors for many different monthly magazines, he promoted and introduced western literature and liberal ideas to Chinese people.

Canary Wharf is a major business district in Tower Hamlets, East London. It is one of the United Kingdom's two main financial centres, second only to the traditional City of London. It contains many of Europe's tallest buildings, including the second-tallest in the UK, One Canada Square. Canary Wharf is located on the West India Docks on the Isle of Dogs.
West India Dock Company.
From 1802 to the late 1980s, the Canary Wharf Estate was a part of Millwall, Limehouse and Poplar and was one of the busiest docks in the world. West India Docks was primarily developed by Robert Milligan (c. 1746–1809) who set up the West India Dock Company. After the 1960s, the port industry began to decline, leading to all the docks being closed by 1980.
Canary Wharf today.
The Canary Wharf of today is a complete reworking of the old dock area into a new business area. 
Initially, the City of London saw Canary Wharf as a threat. Recovery in the property market generally, and demand for Grade A office space, improved the level of interest. A critical event was the much-delayed start of work on the Jubilee line extension, which the government wanted ready for the Millennium celebrations.
Public transport.
Canary Wharf has stations on the Jubilee Line and the Docklands Light Railway and since 2022 the Elizabeth Line.

The family includes about 86 living species. It is made up of marine fish living in tropical seas, usually around coral reefs. Many of the species are brightly colored and popular for aquaria.
One of the characteristics of this family is that they have spines on the tail (also known as "thorn tail").
Morphology.
Surgeonfish have dangerously sharp spines and can slash a person, causing serious injury. Most species of the family are of small size, between 15-40 cm (6-15 in), but the genera "Prionorus" or "Naso" can be larger. The whitemargin unicornfish is the largest species in the family.
Extinct genera.
Acanthuridae includes several extinct genera:
In the aquarium.
Tangs are very sensitive to disease in the home aquarium. It is necessary to quarantine the fishes before introducing them to the aquarium.

Wacław Potocki (1621 – 1696) was a Polish Baroque poet.
Biography.
Wacław Potocki was born in the village named Wola Łużańska near the town of Biecz in Southern Poland. He was a member of noblemen family. They were Polish Brethren, Christians of the Minor Reformed Church. He was married to Katarzyna Morsztyn. After all Polish Brethren were given order either to become Roman Catholic or to go out of Poland forever, he changed his faith. Wacław Potocki died at Łużna in 1696. He was buried in Francuscan Church in Biecz.
Works.
Wacław Potocki wrote a lot. He is the author of "Ogród fraszek" ("The Garden of Verses") that consists of more than 2 000 short poems. Another book by Potocki, named "Moralia" is composed of more than 2 000 pieces, too. This was based on "Adagia" by Erasmus of Rotterdam. He wrote many poems, sometimes in ottava rima. His best known work is an epic poem "Wojna chocimska" ("The War of Chocim"). It was compared by Claude Backvis, a Belgian scholar, to John Milton's Paradise Lost. It narrates about the great battle against the Turks. The battle was fought in 1621, when the poet was born. The poem was written fifty years after. It is in heroic couplets. Lines of the poem consist of thirteen syllables with feminine rhymes.

Esociformes are a small order of ray-finned fish (the Actinopterygii). There are two families, the Umbridae (mudminnows) and the Esocidae (pikes).
The Esocidae are named after the pike genus "Esox". One highly successful species is "Esox lucius" or northern pike. 
The Esociform fishes live in freshwater, in North America and northern Eurasia.
The order is very similar to the Salmonidae.
Families.
Esocidae.
The family Esocidae has three extant genera ("Esox", "Novumbra", and "Dallia") that comprise a holarctic distribution.
Umbridae.
Umbridae is another family. So far, the genus "Umbra" is the only extant genus. The other genera have gone extinct.

Bethany [beth-uh-nee]is a female first name. It comes from the Biblical place Bethany, the town where Lazarus lived in the New Testament.The origin of the name Bethany can be traced back to the Hebrew term bethania, which translates to "house of figs" or "house of affliction."In English speaking countries, Bethany has been very popular. It was the 59th most popular name for England and Wales in 2010. In 1999, it had gone as high as number 11. In the United States, the name was the 87th most popular in the late 1980s. This name is ranked #646 on the "Popular Names in 2021". 
"Beth" is a short version of this name. "Beth" can also be a short version of the female name Elizabeth.

Jackson is a village in Dakota County, Nebraska, United States. The population was 207 at the 2020 census.
History.
Before Jackson was formed, the town Old St. John's was started about 1.5 miles north of where Jackson is on June 2nd, 1856 by a Catholic colony of sixty Irish immigrants led by Father Trecy. The colony was one of the first towns started in Dakota County, and the first group of Catholic people to start a town together in Nebraska. When the rising Missouri River started to make it dangerous to live there around 1860, all of the residents of Old St. John's moved south to what is now called Jackson.
Jackson was originally called Franklin, and was started with that name around 1860. The people who lived in there later found out that there was already a place in Nebraska that was called Franklin. To make things less confusing, they renamed the town after Andrew Jackson so nobody would get confused. St. Patrick's Catholic Church, which is in Jackson, is where the Nebraska State Historical Society put historical marker 34. The historical St. Patrick's Catholic church was built on land that was given to the church by the McCormick family around the time Jackson was started.
Location.
Jackson can be found at (42.448789, -96.566207).
The United States Census Bureau says that the village takes up about , of land.

Elmer Ferguson (February 25, 1885 – April 26, 1972) was a Canadian sports journalist. Born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Ferguson moved to Montreal in 1910 and became the sports editor of the Montreal Herald in 1913. Ferguson was one of the most respected and promiant columnists of his time. He became a Hockey Hall of Fame media honouree in 1982 and was the namesake of the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award.
Career.
At the age of six, Ferguson started selling newspapers on the streets of Moncton, New Brunswick and became a copy boy with the Moncton Transcript when he was 17. He soon became a sports writer with the paper and became the news editor in 1910. With Ferguson as editor, the Moncton Transcript became the first Maritime newspaper to print a full sports page every day.
Soon after, Ferguson left for Montreal where he got a job as an editor at the Montreal Herald. He became sports editor of the paper in 1913 and soon became a well known sports journalist with his column "The Gist and the Jest of It". He was sports editor for the paper for 39 years and continued to write columns until the Herald folded in 1957. He continued to write columns for The Montreal Star until a few months before his death in 1972.
In addition to his work in the print media, he was also a colour commentator on radio broadcasts for the Montreal Maroons (1933–1938) and the Montreal Canadiens (1938–1967), where he was partnered with Hall of Fame broadcasters Doug Smith and Danny Gallivan.
Ferguson was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame as a builder in 1968. In 1984, Ferguson was recognized as one of the first Hockey Hall of Fame media honourees. The award that is given out was named the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award in his honour.

The Ardèche () is a long river in south-central France, a right-bank tributary of the River Rhône. The river gives its name to the French department of Ardèche.
Geography.
The Ardèche river has a length of and a drainage basin with an area of approximately .
Its average yearly discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) is 64.8 cubic metres per second at Saint-Martin-d'Ardèche in the Gard department.
Course.
The Ardèche river starts in the Massif Central, within the "Parc naturel régional des Monts d'Ardèche" ("Regional nature park Mountains of Ardèche"), in the "commune" of Astet (Ardèche department), at an elevation of about .
It then flows roughly to the southwest and, after the towns of Aubenas and Ruoms, it gets into its famous gorge (or canyon) below Vallon-Pont-d’Arc.
The valley of the Ardèche is very scenic, in particular a section known as the Ardèche Gorges (or the Canyon of Ardèche). The walls of the river here are limestone cliffs up to high. A kayak and camping trip down the gorge is not technically difficult and is very popular in the summer. The most famous feature is a natural stone arch across the river known as the Pont d'Arc.
Finally, the river flows into the Rhône river, on the right side, near the "commune" Pont-Saint-Esprit, Gard department.
Communes.
The Ardèche passes through the following regions, departments and communes:
Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes
Occitanie
Main tributaries.

It began in 1987 and is awarded each year. The prize ceremony takes place on the first Sunday of November in Bergen, Norway at the National Theatre of Bergen.
Past winners.
The first person to receive the prize was Jiří Hájek (1913–1993), a Czech politician and diplomat. He was one of the founders of Charter 77, an organization that worked for human rights in Czechoslovakia. Some other winners of the Rafto Prize are:

The Battle of Kororāreka was a battle in New Zealand between Maori warriors and the British Army. It took place on 11 March 1845 in the small town of Kororāreka. Today that town is called Russell. The town is on the North Island of New Zealand. The Māori were unhappy with the problems in the town. They cut down the flag pole flying the British flag. Each time the Maori cut down the flag pole, the British Army made a new one. This happened three times. When the British Army put the flag pole back a fourth time, the Māori attacked the town. Hōne Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti were the leaders of the Māori. William Hulme was the leader of the British soldiers. The Maori had many more fighters than the British. There were 600 Māori warriors and only 140 British soldiers. The Māori won the battle. The town was destroyed in the fighting. The British Army left the town. The British citizens living there also left. British and American ships waiting in the harbour took them to Auckland.

The Circinus galaxy (ESO 97-G13) is a Seyfert galaxy, very bright and emitting huge amounts of electromagnetic radiation.
Circinus is in a constellation of the same name, Circinus (constellation). It is one of the closest and nearest galaxies to the Milky Way. It is probably slightly further away than Centaurus A.
The galaxy just 4 degrees below the galactic plane and 13 million light years from our galaxy. Its outer ring is 700 light years from the galaxy's centre, and the inner ring just 130 light years from the centre. You can see the galaxy with a small telescope.
The galaxy was not noticed until 1977 because it lies close to the plane of the Milky Way and is obscured by galactic dust.

Relativistic jets are very powerful jets of plasma with speeds close to the speed of light. They are emitted by the central black holes of some active galaxies (notably radio galaxies and quasars), and by the black holes of massive stars and neutron stars. Their lengths can reach several thousand or even hundreds of thousands of light years.
If the jet speed is close to the speed of light, the effects of the special theory of relativity are significant. The mechanics behind how jets are created, and what they are made of, are still a matter of debate. Jet composition might vary.
Massive galactic central black holes have the most powerful jets. Similar jets on a much smaller scale develop from neutron stars and black holes in other stars. Even weaker and less relativistic jets may be associated with many binary star systems.
The general hypothesis among astrophysicists is that the formation of relativistic jets is the key to explaining the production of gamma-ray bursts. These jets have Lorentz factors of ~100 or greater (that is, speeds over roughly 0.99995c), making them some of the fastest celestial objects known at present.

The Border states were those states that during the American Civil War did not leave the Union. The border states were Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri. After West Virginia separated from Virginia, it was also considered a border state. Most border states had strong ties to the South culturally, but they had economic ties to the North. While remaining loyal to the Union, the Border States were themselves slave-holding states.
In the Border States the war caused divided loyalties. They were the scene of often brutal guerilla warfare where neighbor fought against neighbor. The bitter feelings in the Border States lasted long after the Civil war.
Background.
In the border states, slavery was already dying out in urban areas and the regions without cotton. Several cities were rapidly industrializing, including Baltimore, Louisville, and St. Louis. By 1860, most of the African Americans in Delaware were free. By the start of the Civil War, slave ownership in the south had become concentrated into fewer and fewer hands. In 1830, 36% of Southern families owned slaves. By 1860, the number had fallen to 25%. In the Upper South it had fallen even more. In 1830, slaves made up 18% of the population. In 1860, they made up only 10%. During the same period in Kentucky, it fell from 24% to 19%. In Maryland, it went from 23% to 13%. Some slaveholders made a profit by selling surplus slaves to traders to be resold in the slave markets in the Deep South. They needed field hands for the cotton plantations.
In the South, slavery had become less and less useful to farmers as tobacco prices began to fall after the American Revolutionary War. But in 1793, Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin. This made Southern grown cotton highly profitable. Cotton also required large numbers of slaves. Most Southerners, however, did not own slaves. But by 1860 cotton and slavery was the strong link in the Southern economy. Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, which had many areas with much stronger cultural and economic ties to the South than the North, were deeply divided.
The five border states.
Each of these five states shared a border with Union states. All but Delaware also share borders with states that joined the Confederate States of America (CSA).
West Virginia.
In October 1859 John Brown's raid on the Harpers Ferry Armory in what is now Harpers Ferry, West Virginia (at the time part of the state of Virginia) sent shock waves through the South. Although Brown was quickly captured and executed, the incident had a profound effect on the 1860 presidential election. When Abraham Lincoln won over three Democratic Party candidates, it triggered Southern secession. At the outbreak of the Civil War, the 40 western counties of Virginia were strongly against secession and they seceded from Virginia. The counties that later became West Virginia had relatively few slaves.
Delaware.
By 1860 Delaware was tied to the Northern economy and slavery was rare except in the southern parts of the state. Overall, 91.7% of the black population of Delaware was free by this time. Both houses of the state General Assembly rejected secession. Delaware's lower house was unanimous in rejecting the idea. The state senate voted against secession five to three. Many of the state's politicians including the governor, their two U.S. Senators and their sole representative in Congress, were sympathetic towards the South. But the state legislature better represented the feelings of the people of the state in remaining with the Union. However, they also disapproved of forceful abolitionism. Generally, most people in the state wanted a compromise that would prevent a war between the North and South. 
Maryland.
Maryland found itself trapped by the war. The state was split. They were clearly tied economically to the North but culturally to the South. By 1860, 49.1% of Maryland's black population was free. But Maryland's Southern and Eastern counties had a history of over 200 years of using slaves in growing tobacco and other crops. This put them in a difficult position. Their politicians had worked hard to prevent government from interfering with slavery in their counties. In the 1860 presidential election, Lincoln did not receive a single vote from these counties. This was in spite of the fact that Lincoln promised not to interfere with slavery in the states where it already existed. But the Maryland legislature never considered a resolution to secede from the Union. The governor suggested calling a convention to consider secession, but the legislature ignored his request. 
On April 19, 1861, Union troops moving through Baltimore were attacked by angry mobs of Southern sympathizers. It left 14 people dead and lasted for three days. Many rushed to the outskirts of Baltimore to set up roadblocks to try to prevent Union troops from passing through the city. The riots and protests might have led to secession had they been organized. But Union troops moving to Washington, D.C. were quickly changed to being transported by water to avoid the tense situation in Baltimore. Throughout the winter and spring of 1861, Maryland decided against neutrality and against joining the Confederacy. But in May of 1861, acting without orders, General Benjamin Franklin Butler marched into Baltimore. He occupied Federal Hill and set up cannons threatening anyone who would move against them. Lincoln was furious and promptly relieved Butler of his command. Still, the Massachusetts troops were left on Federal Hill. To prevent further trouble Lincoln suspended "habeas corpus" and imprisoned without charges or trials one sitting U.S. congressman as well the mayor, police chief, entire Board of Police, and the city council of Baltimore. 
Chief Justice Roger Taney, acting only as a circuit judge, ruled on June 4, 1861, in "Ex parte Merryman" that Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus was unconstitutional, but the president ignored the ruling in order to meet a national emergency. On September 17, 1861, the day the legislature reconvened, federal troops arrested without charge 27 state legislators (one-third of the Maryland General Assembly). They were held temporarily at Fort McHenry, and later released when Maryland was secured for the Union. Because a large part of the legislature was now imprisoned, the session was canceled and representatives did not consider any additional anti-war measures. The song "Maryland, My Maryland" was written to attack Lincoln's action in blocking pro-Confederate elements. Maryland contributed troops to both the Union (60,000) and the Confederate (25,000) armies. During the war, Maryland adopted a new state constitution in 1864 that prohibited slavery. It also freed all remaining slaves in the state.
Kentucky.
Kentucky was strategic to Union victory in the Civil War. Lincoln once said, 
"I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game. Kentucky gone, we cannot hold Missouri, nor Maryland. These all against us, and the job on our hands is too large for us. We would as well consent to separation at once, including the surrender of this capitol [Washington, which was surrounded by slave states: Confederate Virginia and Union-controlled Maryland."
Lincoln reportedly also declared, "I hope to have God on my side, but I must have Kentucky." In the spring of 1861, Kentucky Governor Beriah Magoffin along with the state legislature declared the state would remain neutral. They would not provide troops to either the Union or the Confederacy. At the same time the declaration offered to mediate a peace between the two sides. 
Neutrality was broken when Confederate General Leonidas Polk occupied Columbus, Kentucky, in the summer of 1861. This caused Kentucky to call for Northern aid to repel the Confederate invaders. Union General Ulysses S. Grant, who was waiting across the Ohio River in Illinois, moved to occupy Paducah and Southland, Kentucky. Polk's blunder cost the Confederacy any chance of getting Kentucky to join them. The occupied areas gave the Union a tremendous advantage in both Kentucky and Tennessee. During the war, about 35,000 men from Kentucky joined the Confederacy. Those who joined the Union army totaled about 74,000, including about 24,000 African Americans.
Missouri.
Missouri had been involved in fighting on the Kansas-Missouri border since 1854 over the issue of slavery. The dispute was aptly named Bleeding Kansas. When the Civil War began on April 12, 1861, the entire state of Missouri was firmly divided between pro-Confederate and pro-Union forces. The governor of Missouri, Claiborne Jackson refused to send volunteers from the state to fight for Abraham Lincoln when he called for troops. Instead, the governor had the state militia muster outside the city to begin training in preparation to join the Confederate forces. He called upon the legislature to authorize a state constitutional convention on secession. A special election approved of the convention, and sent delegates to it. This Missouri Constitutional Convention voted to remain within the Union. 
Jackson, who was pro-Confederate, was disappointed with the outcome. He called up the state militia to their districts for annual training. Jackson had designs on the St. Louis Arsenal, and had been in secret correspondence with Confederate President Jefferson Davis to obtain artillery for the militia in St. Louis. Aware of these developments, Union Captain Nathaniel Lyon struck first, encircling the camp, and forcing the state militia to surrender. While his troops were marching the prisoners to the arsenal, a deadly riot erupted (the Camp Jackson Affair). This caused greater Confederate support in the state. The already pro-Southern legislature passed the governor's military bill creating the Missouri State Guard. Governor Jackson appointed Sterling Price, who had been president of the convention, as major general of this reformed militia. Price, and Union district commander Harney, came to an agreement known as the Price–Harney Truce, which calmed tensions in the state for several weeks. After Harney was removed, and Lyon placed in charge, a meeting was held in St. Louis at the Planters' House among Lyon, his political ally Francis P. Blair, Jr., Price, and Jackson. The negotiations went nowhere. After a few fruitless hours, Lyon declared, "this means war!" Price and Jackson rapidly departed for the capital. 
Lyon quickly moved his army to attack the pro-confederate forces at Jefferson City, Missouri, the state capital. He moved quickly enough to catch them unprepared. On June 15, Lyon's small Union army occupied Jefferson City. Lyon installed a pro-Union government after Jackson and most of his militia retreated to the southwest corner of Missouri. Lyon moved his army to go after the rebels. On June 17, both sides fought the Battle of Boonville which lasted only about 30 minutes. The Union forces completely routed the pro-confederates. He then lead his troops into a series of skirmishes with the Missouri State Guard and the Confederate Army.
Lyon next moved to Springfield, Missouri where the army camped. On August 10, Lyon's Army of the West was defeated by a combined force of the Missouri Militia and Confederate troops under the command of Benjamin McCulloch near Springfield, Missouri. This was called the Battle of Wilson's Creek. Lyon was killed while trying to rally his outnumbered soldiers. However, Lyon’s efforts prevented the State of Missouri from joining the Confederacy. Missouri abolished slavery during the war in January 1865.

Punta La Marmora () is a mountain in the Gennargentu range, Sardinia (Italy).
Name.
The mountain is named after Alberto della Marmora, an Italian geographer and naturalist who described the island in two works: "Voyage en Sardaigne" (1826) and "Itinéraire de l'île de Sardaigne" (1860).
The name of the mountain, in the Sardinian language, was "Perdas Carpìas", which means "split stones" because of its rocks of schist which tend to break into pieces.
Geography.
The Punta La Marmorea is in the communes of Desulo and Arzana (province of Nuoro), in the "Barbagia" mountain area of inner Sardinia. With its summit at an elevation of , it is the highest peak on the Sardinia island.
Near Punta La Marmorea, there are other high mountains as "Bruncu Spina" that, with an elevation of , is the second highest point of Sardinia. They are part of the Gennargentu National Park.
The mountain is formed by metamorphic rocks, mainly shales, from Paleozoic era.
Punta La Marmora is just east of the approximate centre of Sardinia. On a clear day, it is possible to view from the top over a large part of Sardinia and the mountains of southern Corsica.
Climate.
Snowfalls are frequent in winter, usually with an average depth over of snow. Snowfalls are stronger in January and February.
The wind on the summit can reach up to .
Hiking.
The summit is reached by hiking. The easiest route is from the "Bruncu Spina" mountain where there are ski lifts to get to the top; from there, it is easy to get to the five highest summits of Sardinia, including Punta La Marmora.

The collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda will happen about four billion years in the future.
The Andromeda galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at about as shown by its blueshift. Until 2012, it was not known whether the possible collision was definitely going to happen or not, because its proper motion was too small to measure.
In 2012, researchers concluded that the collision is sure to happen. They used the Hubble Space Telescope to track the motion of stars in Andromeda between 2002 and 2010 with great accuracy. Andromeda's tangential or sideways velocity with respect to the Milky Way was much smaller than the speed of approach. Therefore, it is expected that it will collide with the Milky Way in around 4 billion years.
Such collisions are relatively common. Andromeda, for example, has collided with at least one other galaxy in the past. Several dwarf galaxies such as SagDEG are already colliding with the Milky Way and being merged into it. The Antennae galaxies are an example of two roughly equal spiral galaxies colliding.

Scrapie is a fatal disease that affects the nervous system of sheep and goats. It is similar to Mad cow disease which affects cattle. Scrapie was first described in 1732. Much like with mad cow disease, prions seem to be involved in transmitting it.

The Marecchia () is a river of the Emilia-Romagna region. The city of Rimini gets its name from the Latin name of the river.
Its low course marks the end of the Padan Plain ().
Geography.
The Marecchia river has a length of , and a drainage basin with an area of approximately .
Its discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) depends of the season: in the autumn could be as high as but is very low during summer. Most of the time, the discharge is about .
Course.
The Marecchia river flows through a valley named after it, "Valmarecchia". The river starts at about west of "Viamaggio" ("comune" of Pieve Santo Stefano) and about southwest of the "comune" of Badia Tedalda, in the province of Arezzo (Tuscany), in the "Alpe della Luna" at an elevation of above sea level.
At about to the northeast of Badia Tedalda, the river flows into the Emilia-Romagna region, in the Casteldelci "comune", province of Rimini. Then it flows through Ca 'Raffaello, an exclave of Badia Tedalda; to the north of here, the Senatello river flows into the Marecchia as a left tributary. Later, in "Ponte Masa", the Masa river flows from the right into the Marecchia.
Shortly after "Torello", the San Marino river flows as a right tributary and, after the Verucchio "comune", the Ausa flows also from the right.
Between the "frazioni" (Italian subdivisions of a municipality) of "Rivabella" and "San Giuliano", in Rimini, the Marecchia river ends in the Adriatic Sea.
The Bridge of Tiberius () or Bridge of Augustus () is a Roman bridge in Rimini. Its construction began in the times of Augustus but was finished in 20 AD in the times of Tiberius.
Main tributaries.
The tributaries of the Marecchia river are:

Perfect information has different definitions depending on the field.
In economics, the term perfect information refers to an element of competition in a market which is perfect and idealized. This is commonly known as perfect competition.
In the mathematical branch of game theory, a perfect information game uses perfect information if all the actions taken in the game are known, and the state of the game's materials is available to all players. Perfect information is a type of common knowledge. Perfect information relates to the materials of the game, and to the rules of the game.
It follows that imperfect information is when elements of the game (materials or rules) are not equally available to all participants. 
Perfect information games do not require that each player has a working memory of past positions but that merely they have had the opportunity to view such past actions.
Examples.
In a game of chess or go, the pieces and the rules are known, but the implications of the position are not. This identifies chess as a perfect information game. In competitive card games like bridge and poker, the cards held by opponents are not known, or only partly known. They are not perfect information games.

The Compromise of 1850 was a series of laws passed in 1850 that dealt with the controversial issue of slavery in the United States. As a result of the Mexican–American War, the United States acquired a large amount of new territory. The laws admitted California as a free state, and created the new territories of New Mexico and Utah. A dispute over the boundary between Texas and New Mexico was settled with Texas losing the New Mexico territory. It put an end to the slave trade in Washington, D.C. and made it easier for Southern slave owners to recover runaway slaves. The compromise called for each new state to decide for itself whether it would be a slave or free states. The commerce and trade compromise ended the slave trade and eventually led to the Emancipation Proclamation.
Background.
The Missouri Compromise, passed in 1820, was an agreement between the pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions in the United States Congress. It concerned the regulation of slavery in the western territories. It admitted Missouri as a slave state to please the South. It admitted Maine as a free state to please the North. It kept the balance of power in the United States Senate between the free states and slave states. The plan also called for slavery to be banned from the Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 36 degrees 30' north (also known as the Missouri Compromise Line), except within the boundaries of the proposed state of Missouri. It was a temporary measure that reduced the conflict over slavery. But there was continued resentment between North and South. The South resented Congress interfering with slavery. The North resented having to compromise on the moral issues of slavery. Both sides wanted the political power necessary for their issue to win. In his book "Negro President: Jefferson and the Slave Power", historian Garry Wills wrote, “the South was not demanding slave representation to achieve a near-parity at the moment, but as a way of achieving majority control in the immediately foreseeable future.”
In 1849, when Zachary Taylor became president, the new territories the U.S. gained after the Mexican-American war caused the issue of slavery to become critical again. The California Gold Rush had caused the population there to suddenly increase and Californians now wanted statehood as a free state. This upset the balance of 15 free states and 15 slave states established by the Missouri Compromise.
Debate.
Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky presented resolutions on January 29, 1850 saying they represented the spirit of compromise that would keep the Union together. Former Vice President and Senator from South Carolina John C. Calhoun saw it differently. For a month he worked on a speech but was too ill to deliver it. Virginia Senator James A. Mason read it on the floor of the Senate on March 4. In a speech on March 7, Senator Daniel Webster of Massachusetts spoke in favor of compromise. Abolitionists in the North saw this as a betrayal and giving in to slavery interests. William H. Seward, then the Senator from New York, spoke next for the abolitionists. He claimed there was a "higher law than the Constitution," which prevented any compromise with slavery.
At the same time the House of Representatives was also debating the question. No agreements had been reached by early April so a committee was suggested by Senator Henry S. Foote of Mississippi. Called the "Committee of Thirteen" it was made up of seven Whigs and six Democrats. The committee drafted a bill based mainly on Clay's compromise resolutions made in January. Clay himself was the chairman and presented the bill on May 8.
The Compromise.
Each side got some benefits from the compromise:

Conan the Barbarian is a 1982 American fantasy-adventure movie directed by John Milius. Based on the stories of Robert E. Howard, the movie tells the story of a warrior prince (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who must battle and defeat Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), an evil sorcerer who murdered his parents. Although initial reception for the film was poor, it was a box-office hit and launched Schwarzenegger's career, and in the years since, it has become a cult movie. A sequel, Conan the Destroyer, was released in 1984, and a remake was also released in 2011.
Plot.
In the fictional country of Cimmeria, a sword is forged by a blacksmith (William Smith), who shows it to his young son Conan as he tells him "the Riddle of Steel", which is an aphorism of the importance of metal to their people. One day, the Cimmerians are massacred by the warriors of the sorcerer Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), who is the leader of a snake cult. Dogs kill Conan's father and his mother is killed when Doom decapitates her with his sword. The children, Conan among them, are taken into slavery and chained to a mill called The Wheel of Pain. Conan grows into a young man (Arnold Schwarzenegger), whose muscles have built from years of pushing the heavy grindstone. His master eventually trains him into a gladiator; he is eventually freed after winning several pit fights and receiving training in the East. Conan travels to a warrior's tomb and retrieves a sword. He later on encounters a prophetic witch (Cassandra Gava) and befriends the thief Subotai (Gerry Lopez).
On the advice of the witch Conan and Subotai travel to the city of Zamora to find Doom. There, they encounter the female warrior Valeria (Sandahl Bergman). They steal treasure from the Tower of Serpents-killing a giant snake in the process-and after escaping, the thieves celebrate and Conan and Valeria fall in love. The city guards capture the trio and bring them to the court of King Osric (Max von Sydow), who requests that they rescue his daughter-who has become a follower of Doom-for a reward. Subotai and Valeria refuse, but Conan-driven by his hatred of Doom-sets off alone to the Temple of Set, where the sorcerer resides.
Conan infiltrates the temple disguised as a priest, but ends up being discovered, captured and tortured. Doom lectures him on the power of flesh, which he demonstrates by forcing one of his followers to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff, before ordering the barbarian to be crucified on the Tree of Woe. Subotai discovers the dying Conan and brings him to the Wizard of the Mounds (Mako), who lives on a burial site for warriors and kings. The wizard summons spirits to heal the barbarian, warning that they will "exact a heavy toll", which Valeria is willing to pay. These spirits try to capture Conan but he fully recovers from his wounds when Subotai and Valeria fight them off. 
Subotai and Valeria agree to help Conan complete the quest and infiltrate the temple of Set. As the cult indulges in a cannibalistic orgy, the thieves attack and flee with the princess. Doom shoots Valeria with a stiffened snake and is mortally injured. She dies of her wounds and Conan has her cremated at the Mounds, where he later prepares with Subotai and the wizard to fight Doom. With the use of booby traps and exploiting the terrain, the two manage to slay Doom's soldiers when they arrive. Valeria reappears briefly as a Valkyrie to protect Conan from a mortal blow. After the death of his men, Doom tries to shoot the princess with a stiffened snake, but Subotai blocks the shot with his shield and the sorcerer flees to his temple.
Conan sneaks back to the temple where Doom addresses the cult members. He confronts Doom, who attempts to mesmerize him. Conan, however, resists and decapitates the sorcerer. After the disillusioned cultists disperse, Conan razes the temple to the ground and returns the princess.

The party seeking to register the site will usually pay the domain name registrar a flat or monthly fee to keep the name registered, so that no other person is able to acquire the web address. The systems setup by the domain name registrar translates IP addresses into easily identifiable domain names. this is called the domain name registrar.

There are 5 arrondissements in the Aisne department. The French departments, and in other countries, are divided into "arrondissements", which may be translated into English as districts (in some cases, as boroughs). The capital of an arrondissement is called a subprefecture.
If the prefecture (capital) of the department is in an arrondissement, that prefecture is the capital of the arrondissement, acting both as a prefecture and as a subprefecture.
Arrondissements are further divided into communes.

Tecumseh ( ; March 1768 – October 5, 1813) was a Native American leader of the Shawnee and a large tribal confederacy (known as Tecumseh's Confederacy) which opposed the United States during Tecumseh's War and became an ally of Britain in the War of 1812. He is also the earliest known ruler of the Shawnee Tribe. 
Family.
Tecumseh had a brother named Tenskwatawa. Tenskwatawa was known as the town drunkard in the town until he changed and became religious. When Tecumseh left for a business trip and left Tenskwatawa in charge, he didn't do a good job. He started a war with his leadership, and a while after Tecumseh returned, Tecumseh was killed. Tecumseh also has a son named Cheeseekau.

The 2016–17 NHL season was the 100th season of operation (99th season of play) of the National Hockey League. 
There were 82 games for each team in the regular season from October 12, 2016 to April 9, 2017. The 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs began on April 12 and ended on June 11 when the Pittsburgh Penguins won game six of the 2017 Stanley Cup Final against the Nashville Predators. This was the penguins' fifth Stanley Cup in their history and their third in nine seasons. They also won the Stanley Cup in 2016 and that means they are the first team since the Detroit Red Wings in 1997 and 1998 to win two Stanley Cups in a row. 
The Washington Capitals were the Presidents' Trophy winners for being the best team of the regular season. Edmonton Oilers player, Connor McDavid, won both the Hart Memorial Trophy, for being the most valuable player to his team, and the Art Ross Trophy for scoring the most goals and assists. The Oilers also made the playoffs for the first time since the 2005-06 NHL season. This tied the record for longest time without making the playoffs at 10 seasons. The Detroit Red Wings missed the playoffs. The last time this happened was in the 1989-90 NHL season. This 25-season streak was the fourth longest in NHL history and the longest in the NHL, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association and theNational Football League. The team with the longest streak in the NHL became the Penguins at 11 seasons. The first round of the playoffs broke the record for most overtime games with 18. The Eastern Conference runner-up was the Ottawa Senators for losing the Conference Final to the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Western Conference runner-up was the Anaheim Ducks for losing the Conference Final to the Nashville Predators. Pittsburgh Penguins' player Sidney Crosby was the Conn Smythe Trophy winner for being the most valuable player of the playoffs.

Piezoelectric material generates a small electrical voltage, when its shape is deformed. This can be by as little as a 0.09% change, and can produce 12mAh worth of electricity at 230V (standard power output). It is important to note that the actual values of a piezoelectric material's volume or surface area do not change, as only the ratios of each axis (x, y and z) that are altered. E.g. a cuboid with 20 meters cubed volume can have the normal dimensions 1 meter by 2 meters by 10 meters, and the deformed dimensions 2 meters by 2.5 meters by 4 meters; the volume would remain the same, .
When processed, the piezoelectric crystal become sharper as they get refined through heating and cooling. This process makes the material much more sensitive to changes in pressure, as well as increases their resistance to compressive stress that would impede its ability to function.

In optics, a virtual image is an image formed when the outgoing rays from an object always diverge (move apart). A plane mirror forms a virtual image positioned behind the mirror. Light from the source only exists in front of the mirror. The image in a plane mirror appears to be as far behind the mirror as the object is in front of the mirror.
In contrast, a real image is one that is formed when the outgoing rays form a point converge at a real location. Real images can be projected onto a diffuse reflecting screen, but a screen is not necessary for the image to form.

The South African Border War refers to the conflict that took place from 1966 to 1990 primarily in South West Africa (now Namibia) between South Africa on one side and the South-West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) and its allies on the other.
The roots of the conflict can be traced back to World War I, when South Africa invaded and conquered the colony of German South West Africa on behalf of the British Empire and the other Allies of World War I. In the aftermath of the German defeat, the League of Nations awarded South Africa a mandate to administer the territory until its inhabitants were ready to govern themselves. 
Following World War II, South Africa refused to surrender South West Africa to a proposed United Nations Trusteeship agreement and instead requested the right to annex it as a fifth province. Steps were taken to integrate South-West Africa into South Africa, including giving the local white population the right to elect representatives to the Parliament of South Africa. 
In 1962, SWAPO was formed to resist South African rule and petition for South West African independence. With support from the Soviet Union, SWAPO began training guerrillas and from 1966 onwards frequently clashed with the South African police and army. The war entered a new phase in 1975, when Angola gained independence and its new communist government began providing support to the guerrillas. South African troops launched raids into Angola to destroy SWAPO bases, which led to battles with the Angolan army. Cuba, which had sent troops to bolster the Angolan government, was directly involved in some of these battles. 
In 1988, South Africa, Angola, and Cuba signed a Tripartite Accord committing them to peace. Cuba agreed to withdraw from Angola if South Africa withdrew from South West Africa and granted that territory independence. South-West Africa gained independence as Namibia in early 1990.

President-elect of the United States is the title used for an incoming president of the United States between the general election on Election Day in November and noon Eastern Standard Time on Inauguration Day, January 20. During this time, the elected nominee is not in office yet.
Since the election for U.S. president is not by popular vote, the title is used for the apparent winner. The decision is finalized when votes of the Electoral College, cast in December, are counted by a joint session of Congress in early January. 
If the current president has won re-election, they are not given the title of president-elect because he or she is already in office and not waiting to become president. If a new president is scheduled to enter, then the current-standing one is said to hold the office on a lame duck basis.

Survivor Series (2016) was a wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) made by WWE for the "Raw" and "SmackDown Live" brands. It happened on November 20, 2016. It happened at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was the thirtieth time a Survivor Series PPV was held and the first to be held in Canada after the Montreal Screwjob in 1997.
Eight wrestling matches were performed at the event. In the most important match, Goldberg beat Brock Lesnar in one minute and 26 seconds in his first match in 12 years. In addition, there were three Survivor Series matches between the wrestlers of "Raw" and "SmackDown".
Brock Lesnar vs. Goldberg.
At WrestleMania XX, Goldberg beat Brock and the next day, both men left WWE. Brock wrestled in New Japan Pro Wrestling, fought in Ultimate Fighting Championship and returned to WWE in April 2012 but Goldberg hardly wrestled again. In 2016, the covers and commercials for the WWE 2K17 video game were shown for the first time and Goldberg was on/in both of them. This made many people think that he would return to WWE and maybe get a rematch with Brock. The two started talking about the match they could have at conventions like the ones for the video game. In October 2017, Paul Heyman said Brock was challenging Goldberg because he was the one wrestler Brock could never beat. That month, Goldberg returned and agreed to fight Brock.
To start the match, Brock pushed Goldberg into the corner and rammed him between the ropes but Goldberg pushed him back hard and Brock fell back. When Brock got up, he took a spear from Goldberg. This happened again and then Goldberg picked Brock up and performed a Jackhammer and won the match.
Results.
 Natalya replaced Nikki Bella, who was attacked backstage before the match.

The Vinča script is a cache of symbols found belonging to the Vinča culture of the central Balkans over 7000 years ago. The symbols have been a topic of debate amongst historians.
The Tărtăria tablets are three tablets discovered in 1961 in the village of Tărtăria(Hungarian: Alsótatárlaka). This is about 30 km (19 mi) from Alba Iulia in Romania.[10]The tablets, dated to around 5300 BC,[11] have symbols inclay: the Vinča symbols. Some claim they are a yet undeciphered language. If this is so, they would be the earliest known form of writing. In 1908 similar symbols were found during excavations, by Miloje Vasić (1869–1956) in Vinča. This is a suburb of Belgrade (Serbia), some 300 km from Turdaș. Later, more were found in another part of Belgrade. Since 1875 over one hundred and fifty Vinča sites have been found in Serbia alone. Many, including Vinča itself, have not been fully excavated. The culture of the whole area is called the Vinča culture. Although some of these symbols look exactly the same as some letters in Etruscan, Greek, and Aramaic,[12] they are generally regarded as a an original, independent development.[13]

Roger Joseph Boscovich (18 May 1711 - 13 February 1787) was a Croatian polymath and Jesuit from the city of Dubrovnik in the Republic of Ragusa (modern-day Croatia). He studied and lived in Italy and France, where he published many of his works.
He produced a precursor of atomic theory and made many contributions to astronomy. In 1753 he discovered the absence of atmosphere on the Moon. 
In Vienna in 1758, he published the first edition of his famous work, "Philosophiæ naturalis theoria redacta ad unicam legem virium in natura existentium" ("Theory of natural philosophy derived to the single law of forces which exist in nature"). It included his atomic theory and his theory of forces. A second edition was published in 1763 in Venice and a third again in Vienna in 1764. In 1922 it was published in London, and in 1966 in the United States. Another edition was published in Zagreb in 1974.
Life.
Boscovich was born in Dubrovnik as the youngest of seven children. He joined the Jesuit school in Dubrovnik, leaving for Rome in 1725. In Rome he was under the care of 2 Jesuit priests whom introduced him to the Society of Jesus. In 1731, enrolled in college at Sant'Andrea delle Fratte. There, he studied mathematics and physics and in 1740 he was appointed professor of mathematics in the college.
Boscovich studied the transit of Mercury, the Aurora borealis, the figure of the Earth, the observation of the fixed stars, the inequalities in terrestrial gravitation, the application of mathematics to the theory of the telescope, the limits of certainty in astronomical observations, and various problems in solid geometry and spherical trigonometry.
In 1742 he and other scientists were consulted by Pope Benedict XIV, as to the best way of securing the structure of the dome of St. Peter's, Rome, in which a crack had been discovered. His suggested placing five iron bands and it was accepted. 
In 1758, Roger Joseph Boscovich described a version of atomic theory. He explained the resistance of hard bodies as due to force rather than "hardness". "The primary elements of matter are in my opinion perfectly indivisible &amp; non-extended points".
As a devoted Jesuit, Boscovich spent his life without ever getting married or having children.

The history of African Americans in The American Civil War includes the over four million slaves and approximately 500,000 free African Americans who were living in the United States at the beginning of the war. Altogether they made up 14% of the population of the country. Many served as soldiers in the Union Army.
Background.
Slavery began in the English colony of Jamestown in 1619. It started with the purchase of 20 Africans—not as reported by John Rolfe from a Dutch ship—but rather from an English warship named the "White Lyon." The Colonists in the Virginia Colony bought the contracts of the Africans as indentured servants. Not long after this it became a custom to hold slaves for life in the colonies. During the 17th and 18th centuries, slaves were used to raise crops of tobacco and food crops. After the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, cotton became the most important crop. At this point slavery became a critical part of the South's economy. With westward expansion, the question of slavery in the new territories became a subject of great debate. It polarized the nation between the interests of the Northern industrial economy and the South's agricultural economy.
This led to the American Civil War. Millions of slaves were brought to America between the 17th and 19th centuries. Slavery was one of the main issues that led to the outbreak of the Civil War.
Union forces.
Union Navy.
The United States Navy, during the Civil War termed the Union Navy, had separate traditions regarding African Americans. The Militia Acts of 1792 excluded black men from serving in the United States Army. This policy remained in place until the second year of the Civil War. The Navy, however, never had such a policy. In the 1840s they limited the number of blacks serving to 5 percent of the enlisted force. But before and after, black and white men served together often performing the same duties. Up to the start of the Civil War, several hundred black men were serving in the Navy. After Fort Sumter was captured by Confederates, a large number of men enlisted in the Navy. The percentage of black men in the Navy rapidly increased. In 1861, they made up about 6 percent of the force. By the summer of 1862 they made up about 15% of the enlisted men.
Many of the African Americans who joined the Navy were from the East Coast of the United States. Many were experienced sailors. Others had worked on the docks and in other related jobs in the shipping industry. The largest number came from Maryland and the Chesapeake Bay area. Also, a large number were transferred from the Army to the Navy in 1864.
African Americans fought in every major campaign and naval battle of the Civil War. They served in the blockading squadrons on the South and Gulf Coasts and in the brown-water navy in the tributaries in the South. African American women served also, most as nurses aboard the "USS Red Rover (1859)", a hospital ship on the Mississippi River. African Americans served in the Navy with great distinction and eight were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, the nation's highest honor.
Union Army.
 Unfortunately, this was exactly what President Abraham Lincoln did not want at the time. He was afraid that if he armed African Americans, especially escaped or former slaves, the border states would secede. This would only make the situation worse for the Union than it already was. But after two years of war, Lincoln began to reconsider the idea. The war was not going well for the North and they badly needed soldiers.
The Militia Act of 1862 allowed the army to use African Americans as laborers and soldiers for the first time since 1792. It did not invite blacks to join the Army but it did cause some blacks to form private militia units. In New Orleans three all-black Louisiana Native Guard units were formed (they later became the 73rd, 74th and 75th U.S. Colored Infantry). In Kansas the First Kansas Colored Infantry was formed (later officially becoming the 79th U.S. Colored Infantry). They fought in a skirmish at Island Mound, Missouri in November 1862. The First South Carolina Infantry, African Descent, fought for the first time in November 1862 (later becoming the 33rd U.S. Colored Infantry). In January 1863, these unofficial units were allowed to become part of the Union Army.
Probably the most famous unit was the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. In February 1863, Massachusetts governor John Albion Andrew, issued the first call for black soldiers in the North. Over 1,000 men joined, many from as far away as Canada and even the Caribbean. To lead them the governor chose Robert Gould Shaw, a young white officer. On July 18, 1863, they attacked Fort Wagner guarding the southern approach to Charleston Harbor. The 54th lost 600 men in the attack including Colonel Shaw—nearly half of the regiment. The fort was defended by 1,700 Confederates.
Pay and treatment.
Black soldiers did not receive equal pay to the white soldiers. They also did not receive the same treatment. Their pay was $10 a month, less $3 for uniforms. White soldiers received $13 a month and had no deductions for uniforms. This was changed in June 1864 when Congress voted to grant black soldiers equal pay and made the change retroactive. While black soldiers were allowed to fight for their country, they were not treated as equals to white soldiers. Their units were racially segregated and were commanded by white officers. Some of their officers had very low opinions of black soldiers and did not train them well.
Captured black Union soldiers were a problem for the Confederacy. They could not treat them the same as captured white soldiers or they would be legitimizing them as being equal. It would also imply they accepted Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which they did not. Three days before the Emancipation Proclamation was to take effect, Jefferson Davis stated: “All negro slaves captured in arms be at once delivered over to the executive authorities of the respective States to which they belong.” The Congress of the Confederate States decided to take it a step further. They later adopted a resolution that any negroes taken in arms would be put on trial for "inciting servile insurrection" and would be punished by the death penalty.
Lincoln declared that “the law of nations ... permit no distinction as to color in the treatment of prisoners of war." He stated that if the Confederacy executed any Union soldier, the Union would do the same to a Confederate soldier. If the Confederacy enslaved a Union soldier, a Confederate soldier would be put to hard labor. While Davis publicly denounced Lincoln's order, it did have the desired effect on black prisoners of war. No more were executed or sent into slavery. But, afterwards it depended on the commander of the Confederate units as to what to do about taking black prisoners. Many simply did not take prisoners of war but shot them as they were surrendering. This happened at the Battle of Poison Spring, the Battle of Fort Pillow and at the Siege of Petersburg.
Confederate forces.
African Americans did serve with the Confederacy. Some went with their masters or were used as labor behind the front lines. They also worked as teamsters and cooks. But for most of the war black men were not allowed to serve as soldiers.
There are, however, nine known photographs of African American men dressed in Confederate uniforms. But the photos do not come with explanations. Of the men in the photos, four are known by name and were slaves who went with their masters to the front lines.
Near the end of the war the idea of using black soldiers was debated. In 1864, General Patrick Cleburne suggested enlisting black slaves into the army. The idea was considered, but it raised the question by at least one Southern politician: "What did we go to war for, if not to protect our property?" Another said: "If slaves will make good soldiers, our whole theory of slavery is wrong." General Robert E. Lee knew he needed soldiers. He stated: "We must decide whether slavery shall be extinguished by our enemies and the slaves be used against us, or use them ourselves." Lee suggested the slaves be freed in exchange for their service as soldiers. But that condition was not in the bill that was approved by the Confederate Congress on March 13, 1865. Only a few thousand blacks enlisted before the war ended. By that time over 200,000 African Americans had served with the Union army.

Jack Vettriano, OBE (born Jack Hoggan, born 17 November 1951), is a Scottish painter. His 1992 painting, "The Singing Butler", became a best-selling image in Britain.
Jack Vettriano grew up in the industrial seaside town of Methil, Fife. He was raised in poverty, and lived with his mother, father and older brother in a spartan miner’s cottage, sharing a bed with his brother and wearing hand-me-down clothes. From the age of 10, his father sent him out to earn money. His father took half his earnings. Vettriano left school at 16.
Much of his art education came from studying paintings at the Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery.
Paintings.
It is fair to say that Vettriano is controversial. Professional art critics do not seem to like his work, but the public does. He is one of at least three modern British artists to make a great deal of money from his works.
In 1989 Vettriano had two canvases in the Royal Scottish Academy annual show. Both paintings sold on the first day and Vettriano was approached by several galleries. Further exhibitions followed in Edinburgh, London, Hong Kong and Johannesburg. In November 1999, Vettriano’s work was shown for the first time in New York City, when 21 paintings were displayed at The International 20th Century Arts Fair at The Armory. More than 40 collectors from the UK flew out for the event and 20 paintings were sold on the opening night.
His easel paintings cost between £48,000 and £195,000 new. According to "The Guardian" he earns £500,000 a year in print royalties. Vettriano's 1992 painting, "The Singing Butler", has been the best-selling image in Britain. On 21 April 2004 the original canvas of "The Singing Butler" sold at auction for £744,500. It had been rejected in 1992 by the Royal Academy summer exhibition.
In March 2010, "Days Of Wine And Roses" was opened by Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond at the Kirkcaldy Museum. The exhibition then transferred to Vettriano's gallery in London.
In February 2011, it was announced that Vettriano's self-portrait "The Weight" would be displayed at the re-opened Scottish National Portrait Gallery from November 2011, the first time he had exhibited at a national gallery. Deputy director Nicola Kalinsky said Vettriano was "a figure we have wanted on our wall for a while for obvious reasons". First Minister, Alex Salmond said of Vettriano, "He is a wonderful artist of considerable talent and achievement and this is a magnificent tribute to the special place he holds in the hearts of people in Scotland."
In September 2013, a major retrospective of Vettriano's work opened at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. 'Jack Vettriano: A Retrospective' ran until 23 February 2014 and featured over 100 works.

The Umayyad conquest of Hispania was the expansion of the Umayyad Caliphate over Hispania, from 711 to 788.
The conquest destroyed the Visigothic Kingdom and set up the Emirate of Cordova under Abd ar-Rahman I. This completed al-Andalus, the unification of Muslim-ruled Iberia (756–788). The conquest was the westernmost expansion of the Umayyad Caliphate and Muslim rule into Europe. Charles Martel defeated them in the Battle of Tours, so they did not conquer France.
The conquering army was made up mainly of Berbers (north-western Africa). They had only recently come under Muslim influence. They arrived in early 711 at Gibraltar.
The Umayyad Caliphate in Damascus was overthrown around 750 AD, but continued in al-Andalus until 1031.
The period from 710 to the fall of the last Islamic state in the Battle of Granada in 1492 is called the "Reconquista".

Slave Power, also called the Slave Power conspiracy and Slaveocracy, was a term first used by abolitionists in 1839 and was in common use by the 1850s. It referred to the economic, social and political influence held by slaveholders in the Southern United States. Southern slaveholders had a great deal power in Congress and many other federal offices up to and including the presidency. This is in spite of the fact they made up only a small minority of the population of the nation. These few very powerful men used their influence to maintain the institution of slavery. The fear in the North was that the slave power conspiracy intended to not only to spread slavery to the Western territories but to all the states in the North.
Background.
Slavery in America began in the English colony of Jamestown in 1619. It started with the purchase of 20 Africans from an English warship named the "White Lyon." The Colonists in the Virginia Colony bought the contracts of the Africans as indentured servants. It became a custom to hold slaves for life in the colonies. During the 17th and 18th centuries, slaves were used to raise crops of tobacco and food crops. After the invention of the cotton gin in 1793, cotton became the most important crop. Slavery became a critical part of the South's economy.
By the late 1850s, there was a widespread belief that a slaveholding oligarchy ran the country. That they ran it for their own benefit to spread slavery was also a popular belief. It was what Abraham Lincoln and the new Republican Party used to gain political power. It was also popular among conspiracy theorists. The Free Soil Party in the 1840s and the Republicans in the 1850s gave Slave Power its credibility. On March 12, 1857, the Cincinnati Daily Commercial published an article about Slave Power. The article called the United States "one great homogeneous slave-holding community" and said slavery had removed all state boundaries. It charged that Slave Power had three objectives. These were: to reopen the slave trade; to extend slavery to the entire country and beyond; and to make the white man a slave to the slave-holding Southern aristocracy and the Northern capitalists.
After 1850, Southern slaveholders had been lobbying for the reopening of the slave trade. So that charge seemed valid. Abolitionists had ample evidence Slave Power wanted to extend slavery to all the states and even the hemisphere. The third claim, that white men would become slaves to the Slave Power was harder to prove even though many believed it was true. 
Those who defended slavery had a number of arguments to justify the institution. They said abolition would destroy the economy of the South. Without slave labor they could not raise cotton, tobacco or rice. Freeing the slaves would cause widespread unemployment, it would lead to uprisings, bloodshed and complete chaos. They pointed to the French Revolution as an example. They pointed out slavery had existed all through history. It was in the Bible and even Abraham had slaves. Their legal argument pointed to the Supreme Court of the United States who decided in "Dred Scott v. Sandford" (1857) that blacks were not citizens but were property.
Economic power.
Southern plantations could be very profitable. Sources differ as to just how profitable they were. Between 1770–1860, land was abundant and easy to obtain making it virtually worthless by itself. It was hard to get rich by just owning land. The Southern elite got very wealthy by owning the labor force that produced the crops on the land. The value of the slaves themselves was between one and two years of the entire national income of the United States. Only a small minority held slaves and it was limited to the Southern United States. Slaves were the real wealth.
A study by Alfred Conrad and John Meyer computed the rate of return for "slave capital". They calculated that slave ownership was at least equal to other forms of investments and higher than most. Slave ownership alone could return as high as 13% per year while railroad bonds would return 6–8%. 
The slave trade was banned in the United States after January 1, 1808. Slave ownership was still legal, but no more African slaves could be brought into the country. Until that time slave traders had become very wealthy by transporting slaves.
Examples of the enormous wealth of Southern slave owners includes Joshua John Ward of Georgetown County, South Carolina. He owned 1,130 slaves and controlled six large plantations. In 1850, he grew of rice earning his nickname as the "King of the Rice Planters". Another was Stephen Duncan. He was the wealthiest cotton planter before the Civil War. Over his lifetime he owned more than 2,000 slaves. He owned 15 plantations. The largest one used 858 slaves.
Political power.
The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was a large political concession given to the South. It created a new commission that acted similar to the United States Marshals Service but with several differences. They were paid a reward by the federal government for each slave (or those who were claimed to be slaves) that was captured. They quickly became the largest federal employer at the time. The new act was anything but pro-States' rights as Northern state laws were ignored. There was no due process of law. In short, the Fugitive Slave act gave Southern states the power over the laws of Northern states by using the federal government to do their bidding.
The Act of 1850 alarmed Northerners both black and white. Free blacks had much to fear about being kidnapped and finding themselves a captive slave in the South. Northern whites were alarmed because their communities were being assaulted by slave hunters. Northerners saw this as proof positive of a Slave Power conspiracy that was threatening their liberty.
Northern Free-Soilers and Republicans had their differences. But one thing they agreed on was they both opposed slavery expanding to the territories. Both opposed the Southern planters who they called "slave oligarchs". Together they had an advantage over earlier attempts by political parties to oppose slavery. Earlier, Northern politicians had to go easy on slavery issues because they needed the political power of the Southerners to win national elections. For that reason they supported slaveholding presidents, congressmen and senators. But the Republicans and Free-Soilers did not need to please the Southern politicians and they attacked their power at every opportunity. They brought up old arguments that Slave Power had too long held power in American politics. That argument was used when Thomas Jefferson had been elected president. It came up when Missouri was admitted as a slave state in 1820 and again in 1845 when Texas was annexed. This time the Republicans hammered the idea hard. It hurt Northern Democrats the most. Republicans won many offices in the North that had been held by Democrats for decades. In the 1860 election, the Democrats split between North and South with each supporting their own candidate. This allowed Lincoln to win even though he did not have a majority. This ended the Slave Power dominance in politics and was a contributing factor to the American Civil War.
Presidents who owned slaves.
Most Antebellum Period presidents were not only from the South, but also owned slaves themselves. Many figured prominently in maintaining the economics of slavery. One reason for so many Southern presidents is that they benefited from the electoral college advantage they held, especially those from the largest slaveholding state, Virginia. In the Constitutional Convention (1787) delegates from Northern states did not want slaves counted as each being one person for the purposes of a state's representation in Congress. Southern delegates wanted slaves to count as individuals even though they could not vote. The delegates finally arrived at the Three-Fifths Compromise. In Article I, section 2 of the United States Constitution, calling slaves by the euphemism "all other persons", the founders counted each slave as three-fifths of a person. This gave slave states one-third more seats in Congress than they would otherwise have based on the number of citizens they had. This factor was decisive in the 1800 presidential election giving Thomas Jefferson the win by the House of Representatives. 
One of the key reasons Washington, D.C. was selected as the United States Capitol was that it located around a slave town, Alexandria, Virginia. New York City was in a free state and in Philadelphia a slave could only be kept for six months before being freed. This was inconvenient for slave owning politicians. Also, Washington D.C. was promoted by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison—three key Southerners who owned slaves. &lt;br&gt;

Daystar Peterson (born July 27, 1992), better known by his stage name Tory Lanez, is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Lanez was perhaps first recognized for his 2014 mixtape "Lost Cause" and his single "Say It" (2015). Lanez is signed to Mad Love Records and Interscope Records. His single "Say It" peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100.
Legal trouble.
On July 12, 2020, Lanez was charged with carrying a concealed weapon. While being arrested, he was pulled over in a limo with fellow rapper Megan Thee Stallion. Megan exited the car with an injured foot. She said it was because of broken glass but she later said that it was from a bullet.
He denied shooting Megan on his fifth studio album "Daystar".
In October 2020, he was charged with felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, personal use of a firearm, and carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle. On December 23, 2022, a jury convicted him on three charges. On August 8, 2023, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

An NP-hard problem is a type of mathematical problem used in computer science. It is a yes/no problem where finding a solution for it is at least as hard as finding a solution for the hardest problem whose solution can quickly be checked as being true. Some NP-hard problems are ones where a working solution can be checked quickly (NP problems) and some are not. NP-hard problems that are also NP problems fit into a category called NP-complete. 
Examples.
An example of a problem that is at least as hard to solve as any other problem that we can quickly check solutions for, which is also quickly checkable (it is both NP-hard and NP): 
A travelling salesman wants to visit 100 cities by driving, starting and ending his trip at home. He has a limited supply of gasoline, so he can only drive a total of 10,000 kilometers. He wants to know if he can visit all of the cities without running out of gasoline.
People don't know how to solve this problem faster than testing every possible answer, but if a solution is found that allows the salesman to do this, we can use an algorithm check that it is true. This problem is also known as Travelling salesman problem.
An example of a problem that is at least as hard to solve as any other problem that we can quickly check solutions for, but that can not be checked quickly (it is NP-hard, but it is not NP):
if someone starts a program that simply goes,
and never stops it, will it run forever?
There is no known way to find a solution to all problems of this kind, and this also cannot be checked.

Lake Louise, also called Lake of the Little Fishes by the Stoney Nakota First Nations people, is a glacial lake within Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada. The village of Lake Louise is on the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1), which is west of Banff, Alberta. The emerald color of the water comes from rock flour carried into the lake by melt-water from the glaciers that overlook the lake. The lake has a surface of and is drained through the 3 km long "Louise Creek" into the Bow River. Moraine Lake and Lake Agnes are also accessible from Lake Louise.
Lake Louise was originally named "Emerald Lake". In 1884 the name was changed, naming it after the daughter of Queen Victoria, Princess Louise Caroline Alberta.

Stevo Todorčević (; born February 9, 1955) is a Canadian-French-Serbian mathematician, one of the world’s leading logicians and a world leader in set theory and its applications to pure mathematics. He is a Canada Research Chair Professor in mathematics at the University of Toronto, and a senior director of research at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) in Paris.
Early life and education.
Todorčević was born at Ubovića Brdo, Bosnia and Herzegovina where he lived until the second grade of primary school. After, his family moved to Banatsko Novo Selo where he finished primary school. He enrolled "Uroš Predić" grammar school in Pančevo. He demonstrated his talent and affinity toward mathematics in the third and fourth years of the grammar school. After finishing grammar school he enrolled Faculty of Science, Belgrade University, where he studied pure mathematics. During his undergraduate studies he attended Đuro Kurepa's advanced mathematical classes. In 1978 he finished graduate studies. Kurepa validated Todorčević's master thesis as good enough to be accepted as a doctoral thesis. Regardless, Todorčević wrote his doctoral thesis in 1979 with Kurepa as his advisory. In his address, preceding the oral defense of the doctoral thesis, Kurepa stressed that he was not able to find external readers of the Stevo's doctoral thesis in Yugoslavia, capable of fully understanding and evaluating Stevo's work, and turned to two university professors from England. Kurepa added that Stevo's talent was a miracle and that Stevo was the most talented out of the 40 Ph.D. students he advised in the past.
Career.
According to the Centre de Recherches Mathématiques, the Fields Institute and the Pacific Institute for Mathematical Sciences announcement, as of December 14, 2014,his work is recognized for its striking originality and technical brilliance. He was an invited speaker at the 1998 ICM in Berlin for his discovery and work on rho-functions. He made major contributions to the study of S- and L-spaces in topology, proved a remarkable classification theorem for transitive relations on the first uncountable ordinal, made a deep study of compact subsets of the Baire class 1 functions thus continuing work of Bourgain, Fremlin, Talagrand, and others in Banach space theory. Together with P. Larson he completed the solution of Katetov’s old compact spaces metrization problem. Among the most striking recent accomplishments of Todorčević (and co-authors) are major contributions to the von Neumann and Maharam problems on Boolean algebras, the theory of non-separable Banach spaces, including the solution of an old problem of Davis and Johnson, the solution of a long-standing problem of Laver, and the development of a duality theory relating finite Ramsey theory and topological dynamics.
Further, Todorčević is known for his the side-condition method in set-theoretic forcing, the invention and development of walks on ordinals and their characteristics, and other research that bridge between different areas of mathematics.
Todorčević's first recognized contribution to Set theory was given in his 1978 Master’s Thesis. He constructed a model of formula_1 in a way to allow him to make the continuum any regular cardinal and derived a variety of topological consequences of formula_2 Here formula_3 is an abbreviation for Martin's Axiom and formula_4– for weak Kurepa Hypothesis.
Todorčević earned his doctoral degree in 1979 at the University of Belgrade with Đuro Kurepa as advisor and Keith Devlin as outside reader. Devlin attended the defense; he encouraged Todorčević to visit Jerusalem where he attended Saharon Shelah's lectures on forcing.
In the July–August 1980 Todorčević attended the six-week summer school called Settop held in Toronto. At the conference, Todorčević along with Abraham had proved the existence of rigid Aronszajn trees and the consistency of formula_5 + there exists a first countable formula_6-space. formula_7 is an abbreviation for the Continuum Hypotesis.
He gave a survey of work on trees from combinatorial and set-theoretic perspectives, in the 1980s., and continued this work on exploring consistent possibilities for various types of trees, looking for results for trees on multiple cardinals, or with required or forbidden types of subtrees. The elegance of his presentation drew a wide audience for this work.
As to the partition calculus in 1980’s, "Todorčević proved a startling square bracket partition result for the uncountable and introduced new technology whose ramifications are still unfolding, and proved a stepping up lemma for negative square bracket partition relations."
Todorčević was a Miller Research Fellow in Berkeley from 1983 to 1985. In the 1985/6 academic year, he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study.
For his proof of the partition relation formula_8, Todorčević earned explicit appreciations. Paul Erdös wrote, "This certainly is an unexpected and sensational result." and Jean A. Larson added, "... (it) was a wonderful shock that introduced a wide audience to the walks on ordinals and the oscillation function." Todorčević obtained this partition relation in September 1984, while lecturing on it in the Berkeley seminar, wrote up the notes of his lectures and circulated them in January 1985 and published the result later, in 1987. The walks on ordinals method Todorčević devised in May 1984 when he came up with a new proof of the existence of a Countryman line. 
In order to establish this partition relation, Todorčević discovered an entirely new mathematical object called rho functions. Sierpinski in 1933 coloured the edges of the complete graph formula_9 whose vertices are the elements of the smallest uncountable cardinal number. He coloured the edges of formula_9 with 2 colours in such a way that each colour appears on some edge of any uncountable subgraph of formula_9. Galvin and Shelah in 1980s had increased the number of colours from 2 to 3. Improving 3 to 4 seemed beyond any available methods. Todorčević used his newly discovered rho functions to increase the colours not just to 4, but all the way up to the smallest uncountable cardinal, which is the maximum conceivable number. This was one of the results for which he was invited to the Berlin ICM.
The discovery of rho functions (and the various applications they have found), an entirely new mathematical object, one out of the five in Set theory in the twentieth century, is celebrated as a major advance in understanding of mathematics and an extended period of exciting progress. 
In 1989 Todorčević published a monograph, "Partition Problems in Topology". He wrote that proof techniques developed for solving
the S-space problem and the L-space problem turn out to be useful in many other problems in general topology, writing "this is so because Ramsey-type theorems are basic and so much needed in many parts of mathematics and (S) and (L) happen to be Ramsey-type properties of the uncountable most often needed by the topologist".
He became a corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts as of 1991 and a full member of the Academy in 2009.
He was invited to deliver the Tarski Lectures in 2014.
Todorčević is the Royal Society of Canada fellow. In the 2016 RSC fellowship nomination detailed appraisal it was written:
Advisory work.
One of his Ph.D. students, Ilijas Farah, won the 1997 Sacks Prize for his Ph.D. dissertation. The Ph.D. was received on June, 1997, at the University of Toronto. Farah, now a York University professor, was an invited speaker on the ICM, Seoul 2014, Logic session where he presented his work related to the Logic and operator algebras.

In late Egyptian Mythology Wepwawet (also rendered Upuaut) was originally a war deity whose cult centre was Asyut in Upper Egypt. His name means "opener of the ways" and he is often depicted as a wolf standing at the prow of a solar boat. Some interpret that Wepwawet is seen as a scout going out to clear routes for the army to proceed forward. One inscription from the Sinai states that Wepwawet "opens the way" to king Sekhemkhet's victory.
Over time, the connection to war, and thus to death, led to Wepwawet also being seen as one who opened the ways to, and through, Duat, for the spirits of the dead.

The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS), based in Washington, D.C., is an American nonprofit organization that does activism against animal cruelty. It was founded in 1954. They do this by organizing campaigns to get laws passed and by investigating companies.
HSUS opposes cruelty against animals used for food.
The organization works on a full range of animals, including pets, wildlife, farm animals, horses, and animals used in research, testing and education.
HSUS works with another organization, the Fund for Animals, to operate animal sanctuaries in five states. However, it does not operate animal shelters itself. HSUS also trains rescue groups and shelters.
HSUS has been criticized for the way it spends its money.
History.
In 1954, there were disagreements in the American Humane Association (AHA), another animal rights organization. The AHA thought that animals could be used in experiments, but some members disagreed. Many of the staff were fired, including Larry Andrews, Marcia Glaser, Helen Jones, and Fred Myers. These people set up HSUS in Washington, DC. At first, it was called the "National Humane Society". This organization focused on national policy. Their first goal was to get laws about humane slaughter passed.
Humane slaughter legislation.
In 1958, the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act passed. This law required slaughterhouses to use humane slaughter methods.
Exposure of cruelty in the dog trade.
In 1961, HSUS employee Frank McMahon began an investigation of dog dealers around the United States. In February 1966, "Life" magazine published an article about some of the poor conditions he found. Tens of thousands of Americans read the article and wrote letters to Congress members, asking them to protect animals more. Later that year, the U.S. Congress approved the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act.

The Battle of Stamford Bridge took place near the village of Stamford Bridge, East Riding of Yorkshire, in England. On the 25 September 1066, an English army under King Harold Godwinson fought an invading Norwegian army led by King Harald Hardrada. 
Harold's brother Tostig Godwinson joined Hardrada's forces. After a bloody and brutal battle, both Hardrada and Tostig, along with a large number of the Norwegians, were killed. Godwinson's achieved a complete victory. The battle marks the end of the Viking Age in England. Less than three weeks later, Godwinson's English army was defeated by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings.
Background.
King Edward the Confessor of England died in January 1066 without having left an heir. This caused a struggle over who would be king after him. A number of claimants from across northwestern Europe thought that they should be the next king and included the King of Norway, Harald Hardrada. According to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", the Norwegians assembled a fleet of 300 ships to invade England. The Norwegian army numbered about 11,000 men. Arriving off the English coast in September, Hardrada was joined by forces recruited in Flanders and Scotland by Tostig Godwinson. Tostig was angry with his older brother Harold, who had been elected king by the witan on the death of Edward. Tostig lost his position as Earl of Northumbria and was exiled in 1065. Tostig had mounted a series of attacks on the Sussex coast England in the spring of 1066. The king believed Tostig's raid on the coast was a sign that William, the Duke of Normandy, was about to invade England.
In the late summer of 1066, the Norwegian-led invaders sailed up the Humber River, then the River Ouse, before they advanced on York. They landed at Riccall after Godwinson had first learned of their invasion. her On 20 September they defeated a northern English army led by Edwin, Earl of Mercia, and his brother Morcar, Earl of Northumbria, at the Battle of Fulford. After the victory, they received the surrender of York. They briefly occupied the city and took hostages and supplies from the city. Then they returned to their ships at Riccall. Hardrada offered peace to the Northumbrians in exchange for their support for his bid for the throne. Then, he demanded more hostages from all of Yorkshire.
At this time Godwinson was in southern England. He was waiting for an invasion from France by the Duke of Normandy. Duke William was another contender for the English throne. Learning of the Norwegian invasion, Godwinson headed north at great speed with his houscarls and as many thegns as he could gather. He made the journey from London to Yorkshire, a distance of about 190 miles, in only four days. Godwinson learned that the Northumbrians had been ordered to send the additional hostages and supplies to the Norwegians at Stamford Bridge. Godwinson hurried on through York to attack them at this place on 25 September. Until the English army came into view, the invaders did not even know that there was an English army anywhere nearby.
Battle.
No one is certain of the exact location of the battle. There is no abbey, marker or cross to mark the place. However, an area southwest of the town called "battle flats" may be the actual location of the battle.
The Vikings were taken completely by surprise. They were resting in the heat of the day. Hardrada was confident enough that he left one third of the Viking forces, along with much of the army's armor, at their camp at Riccall. As the English army attacked downhill many of the Vikings were completely unprepared. The main part of the Viking army was on the other side of the bridge. A small Viking force held the approach to the bridge but they were quickly swept aside. According to legend, a single Viking warrior held the narrow bridge against the English for a time. He killed about 40 English warriors before he was killed.
In the fierce fighting that followed, both Hardrada and Tostig were killed. Most of the Vikings at the bridge were killed. Out of the original fleet of 300 ships, there were only enough men left to man 24 ships on the return to Norway. It has been said that before fighting started, Godwinson offered to return his brother's earldom if he would change sides, but Tostig flatly refused.
Aftermath.
Stamford Bridge was a major victory for Godwinson. It showed he was a very capable commander. It also demonstrated how well trained his Housecarls were. However, Stamford Bridge will always be overshadowed by the Battle of Hastings, which took place just under three weeks later. The battle at Stamford Bridge left Godwinson's army very tired and in need of rest. He had lost the forces of his two earls from the earlier battle. However, he received news that Duke William had landed.
Harold quickly marched his tired army down to London and stopped at Waltham Abbey long enough to pray for another victory. On October 12 he was in London trying to find more soldiers to add to his army before facing William at Hastings. On October 14, Godwinson formed his army on the ridge looking down on the battlefield. That started the Battle of Hastings and the end of Anglo-Saxon rule in England.

William Gordon Welchman (15 June 1906, Bristol – 8 October 1985, Newburyport, Massachusetts) was a Second World War codebreaker at Bletchley Park. He was a British mathematician, university professor, and author.
After the war he moved to the US, and later took American citizenship.
Bletchley Park.
Welchman was one of four early recruits to Bletchley park (the others being Alan Turing, Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner-Barry). They were also the four signatories to the letter to Winston Churchill in October 1941, asking for more resources for the code-breaking work at Bletchley Park. Churchill responded with one of his 'Action This Day' written comments.
Welchman's main work at Bletchley was "traffic analysis" of encrypted German communications. This is, first, looking for an increase in signals. Major events in warfare are signalled in advance by a huge increase in messages. Second, there are standardized parts of a message, such as message origination, message destination, time/date information, and so on. These are much easier to decipher than the actual message content. Welchman developed this approach. Today we describe this as "metadata" analysis.
Welchman helped improve Alan Turing's design of the Polish electromechanical Enigma-cipher-breaking machine, the bombe. Welchman's 'diagonal board', made the device much more efficient in the attack on the ciphers of the German Enigma machine. Bombes became the main mechanical aid in breaking Enigma ciphers during the war. They speeded up the search for current wheel order settings being used with the Enigma machines. The settings were changed often, initially at least once per day.
Welchman was initially head of Hut Six, the section at Bletchley Park responsible for breaking German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers. During his time at Bletchley, Welchman opposed engineer Tommy Flowers' efforts on the Colossus computer (the world's first programmable electronic computer) because Colossus used vacuum tubes.
In 1943, he became Assistant Director in charge of mechanisation and also had responsibility for cryptographic liaison with the US.
Post-war.
Welchman moved to the United States in 1948 where he taught the first computer course at MIT in the United States. He followed this by employment with Remington Rand and Ferranti. Welchman became a naturalised American citizen in 1962. In that year, he joined the MITRE Corporation, working on secure communications systems for the US military. He retired in 1971 but was retained as a consultant.
In 1982 his book "The Hut Six Story" was published, initially by McGraw-Hill in the US and by Allen Lane in Britain. The British Secret Service objected, and so did the National Security Agency. The book was not banned but Welchman lost his security clearance (and therefore his consultancy with MITRE). He was forbidden to discuss with the media either the book or his wartime work.
Welchman died in 1985; his final conclusions and corrections to the story of wartime code breaking were published posthumously in 1986 in the paper 'From Polish Bomba to British Bombe: the birth of Ultra' in "Intelligence &amp; National Security", Vol 1, No l. The entire paper was included in the revised edition of "The Hut Six Story" published in 1997 by M &amp; M Baldwin.

Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision occurred on 12 November 1996 over the village of Charkhi Dadri in Haryana, India. The collision happened between Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747-100B from Delhi to Dhahran(Saudi Arabia) and Kazakhstan Airlines Illyushin II-76 from Chimkent, Kazakhstan to Delhi. The collision caused 349 fatalities and 0 survivors. 
Incident.
SVA763 (Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747-100B) departed from Delhi International Airport to Dhahran at 18:35. KZA1907 (Kazakhstan Airlines Illyushin II-76) was descending to Delhi airport at the same time. Both flights were controlled by VK Dutta. KZA1907 was cleared to descend 15,000 feet altitude, whereas SVA763 was cleared to climb to 14,000feet. After 8 min, KZA1907 reported that they reached 15000 ft altitude, but they were descending to 14,500 ft at that time and were continuing the descent.
Collision.
Not noticing it, soon the KZA1907's tail cut through SVA763's left wing. SVA763 lost control and hit the ground at 1135 kmph. The Ilyushin remained structurally intact as it went in a steady but fast and uncontrolled descent until it crashed in a field. In the end, all 312 people on board SVA763 and all 37 people on KZA1907 were killed.
Place.
The collision took place about west of Delhi. The wreckage of the Saudi aircraft crashed near Dhani village, Bhiwani District, Haryana. The wreckage of the Kazakh aircraft hit the ground near Birohar village, Rohtak District, Haryana.
Investigation.
The crash was investigated by the Lahoti Commission, headed by then-Delhi High Court judge Ramesh Chandra Lahoti. The flight data recorders were decoded by Kazakhstan Airlines and Saudi Airlines under the supervision of air crash investigators in Moscow and Farnborough, England, respectively.
The commission determined that the accident had been the fault of the Kazakh Il-76 commander, who had descended from the assigned altitude of and subsequently and even lower. The report says that the cause of this serious problem in operating procedure was due to the lack of English language skills on the part of the Kazakh aircraft pilots; they were dependent entirely on their radio operator for communications with the ATC.
Just a few seconds from impact, the Kazakh plane climbed slightly and the two planes collided. This was because the radio operator of Kazakhstan 1907 discovered only then that they were not at 15,000 feet and asked the pilot to climb.The tail of the Kazakh plane clipped the left wing of the Saudi jet, severing both parts from their respective planes.
Documentaries.
The disaster was again the subject of an episode in the documentary series "Mayday (TV series)" on 2 March 2009 entitled "Sight Unseen", in a wide-screen format with sophisticated computer animations on National Geographic Channel.

The 1931 China floods or the 1931 Yellow River Floods were a series of floods that occurred in China in the year 1931. It is the most deadly natural disaster by death toll. About 1,000,000-3.7 million people were said to be dead in this series of floods.
Cause.
In the period of 1928-30 China faced a severe drought. Due to some abnormal weather conditions heavy snowstorms and heavy rainfall occurred in parts of central China. The water levels increased in the rivers. The rain grew heavier in July and August in 1931. China faced nine cyclones in July 1931 alone.
Death.
Chinese sources say 1,000,000 died due to the overflow of the Yangtze River. Western sources say a death toll of 3.7 million-4 million people. In July alone, four weather stations along the Yangtze River reported rain totaling over for the month.
The Yangtze and Huai River floods soon reached Nanjing, the capital of China at the time. The city, located on an island in a massive flood zone, suffered catastrophic damage. Millions died of drowning while some died due to starvation, from waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhus. The high-water mark was reached on 19 August at Hankou town in Wuhan, with the water level exceeding above normal. On the evening of 25 August 1931, the water rushing through the Grand Canal washed away dikes near Gaoyou Lake. Some 200,000 people drowned in their sleep in the resulting deluge.

Great Chinese Famine was a great famine in China from 1958 to 1961. Drought, poor weather and some of the policies of the Communist Party of China were among the reasons of the three years of famine. This also further resulted in the Great Leap Forward movement.
History.
According to the government's statistics the total death toll is 15 million people. Historian Frank Dikotter, having been granted special access to Chinese archival materials, estimates that there were at least 45 million premature deaths from 1958 to 1962, although far from all these deaths came about as a result of starvation.
Chinese journalist Yang Jisheng concluded there were 36 million deaths due to starvation, while another 40 million others failed to be born, so that "China's total population loss during the Great Famine then comes to 76 million.
The Great Chinese Famine was caused by a combination of adverse weather conditions, social pressure, economic mismanagement, and radical changes in agriculture imposed by government regulations.
Mao Zedong, chairman of the Chinese communist party, introduced drastic changes in farming which prohibited farm ownership. Failure to abide by the policies led to persecution. The social pressure imposed on the citizens in terms of farming and business, which the government controlled, led to state instability. Owing to the laws passed during the period and Great Leap Forward during 1958–1962, according to government statistics, about 36 million people died in this period.

In their very first season, they reached the Stanley Cup Finals where they lost to the Washington Capitals in five games, and five years later, they won their first Stanley Cup over the Florida Panthers in five games. This accomplishment was predicted by owner Bill Foley before the team had even been named.
History.
Formation and First Season (2017-2018).
After a successful vote on June 22, 2016, Las Vegas was officially approved to get an expansion team. They were allowed to begin playing in the 2017-2018 season. George McPhee was announced as the first general manager of the team. On November 22, 2016, it was revealed that the team name would be the Vegas Golden Knights. After the team paid their expansion fees on March 1, 2017, the Vegas Golden Knights were officially able to start operating. Gerard Gallant was announced as the teams first Head Coach on April 13, 2017.
On June 21, 2017, the Vegas Golden Knights participated in the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The Knights were able to select 1 player from each of the 30 teams in the NHL to join the Golden Knights. 
The Vegas Golden Knights played their first game on October 6th against the Dallas Stars. They won the game 2-1. The Golden Knights played their first home game at T-Mobile Arena on October 10, 2017 against the Arizona Coyotes. Before the game started, the team honoured the victims of the October 1 mass shooting that happened in Las Vegas just 9 days prior. The Golden Knights won the game 5-2. The Golden Knights had a very successful first season. The players on the Golden Knights played a lot better than people thought they would, so they got labelled as the "Golden Misfits". They won the Pacific Division with 109 points and made it to the playoffs.
The Golden Knights played against the LA Kings in the first round of the 2018 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The Golden Knights won the series 4-0. Golden Knights goalkeeper, Marc-Andre Fleury, had 2 shutouts and only let in 3 goals total during the 4 games. In the second round, the Golden Knights played against the San Jose Sharks. Fleury had another 2 shutouts and the Knights won the series after 6 games. The Golden Knights then played against the Winnipeg Jets in the Western Conference Finals. After losing game 1, the Golden Knights won 4 games in a row to beat the Jets.
The Golden Knights became the third team to ever make it to the Stanley Cup Finals in their first year. The only other teams to do it were the Toronto Arenas in 1918 and the St. Louis Blues in 1968. The Golden Knights ended up losing to the Washington Capitals in 5 games. 
2022-2023 Season and Stanley Cup Champions.
During the off season, the Golden Knights fired head coach Pete DeBoer and hired Bruce Cassidy to take over. It was also announced that starting goaltender Robin Lehner would not be playing for the 2022-2023 season due to surgery. This led to the Golden Knights getting Adin Hill to be the backup goaltender to Logan Thompson (and eventually Laurent Brossoit). The Golden Knights had a very successful season despite injuries to Thompson, Hill, and Brossoit. Their captain, Mark Stone, also had injuries that forced him to sit out from mid January until April 18th. The Golden Knights finished the 2022-2023 season with a franchise record 111 points. They were first in the Western Conference and qualified for the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the 5th time in team history. 
In the first round of the Playoffs, the Golden Knights played against the Winnipeg Jets. After losing the first game in the series, the Golden Knights won 4 games in a row to win the series 4-1. With the Golden Knights moving on to the second round, they played against the Edmonton Oilers. During game 3 of the series, Brossoit – who was the Golden Knights starting goaltender at the time – got injured in the first period and Hill had to take over. Despite losing their starting goalie, the Golden Knights won the series in six games. The Western Conference Finals match up featured the Golden Knights vs. the Dallas Stars. The Golden Knights had a very strong start to the series, winning the first 3 games in a row. In the end, the Golden Knights won the series 4-2 to move on to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Florida Panthers.
On June 13, 2023, after a big 9-3 victory in game 5 of the finals, the Golden Knights won their first Stanley Cup just 6 seasons after the team was created.

David Evan McMullin (born on April 2, 1976) is a former CIA operations officer and independent presidential candidate. He ran for office as an independent in the 2016 United States presidential election. He calls himself a conservative alternative to the main presidential candidates. McMullin did not win any states in the election, but he performed well in Utah, where he got 20% of the popular vote.
Early life and career.
McMullin was born on 2 April 1976 in Provo, Utah, to David McMullin and Lanie Bullard. At a young age, his family moved to a rural area outside of Seattle, Washington, where his father worked as a computer scientist and his mother sold bulk foods to neighbors from the family's garage.
He joined the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) after the September 11 attacks.
2016 Presidential campaign.
On 8 August 2016, McMullin announced that he would run as a candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 presidential election as an independent. He decided to run because he saw Donald Trump as being an unfit conservative candidate.
McMullin had the support of several anti-Trump Republican donors. McMullin's campaign was supported by some members of the "Never Trump" movement.
On 6 October, he named Mindy Finn to be his running mate.
His support in Utah mainly arrived after a 2005 audio recording in which Donald Trump was heard bragging in about making unwanted sexual advances on women.
After the 2016 campaign.
After the 2016 campaign, McMullin became a strong critic of Trump and Putin. In a December 2016, op-ed, McMullin blasted Trump as a threat to American constitutional government, saying that the president-elect's actions were "consistent with the authoritarian playbook" and "undermined critical democratic norms including peaceful debate and transitions of power, commitment to truth, freedom from foreign interference and abstention from the use of executive power for political retribution."
To answer if there was any possibility of him running for Jason Chaffetz's seat in 2018, he said: "It is likely that I will seek public office again. That might be in 2018 or it might be sometime down the road, perhaps very far down the road. I genuinely just don't know yet. I'm very focused on things that I think need to be done ASAP and Mindy Finn and I, with our team at Stand Up Republic, advancing them now. It is possible that I will challenge Chaffetz or Senator Hatch, but there are a lot of factors that go into that decision." In the end, he did not run for either office.
On October 5, 2021, McMullin launched an independent campaign to unseat U.S. Senator Mike Lee in the 2022 election. He lost the election in November 2022.
Presidential results.
Below is a table showing his performance in various states. He did not win any state, so subsequently, he did not win any electoral votes.
Political beliefs.
McMullin is against abortion. He also wants to overturn "Roe v. Wade". He said that we would want to reduce unintended pregnancies and promote adoption.
He believes in the "traditional marriage between a man and a woman," but "respects" the "Obergefell v. Hodges" decision (which allowed same-sex marriage nationwide) and wants to "move on" from the issue.
McMullin supports free trade, and believes that it has a lot of benefits. He supports NAFTA and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership.
He also wants to reduce the corporate tax, individual income tax. and the estate tax.
He wants to cut some support of programs like Social Security, and raise the retirement age.
McMullin is one of the few conservatives in the United States who believes in climate change that is caused by humans. He said,"I do believe that the climate is changing, and I do believe that human activity is contributing to it. If I were president, I would increase investment in technologies that can help us limit and decrease our carbon emissions."
On immigration, McMullin supports more border security but not mass deportation.
McMullin supports the part of Obamacare that doesn't allow health insurance companies to deny coverage against people with preexisting conditions. However, he also said that "we also need to do better than ObamaCare."
McMullin admires foreign leaders like Benjamin Netanyahu and Shinzō Abe.
He believes that Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, has an "allegiance to Russian President Vladimir Putin." McMullin accused Putin of trying to destabilize European and North American countries "through fomenting discord between different racial groups, different ethnic groups and different religious groups."
McMullin supports keeping the Guantanamo Bay detention camp open and opposes the use of torture and has criticized Trump's support for it.

They is the third person plural pronoun in English, used to describe a subject. The object form is "them". "They" can be used for both people or objects. 
'They' can also be used for the singular third person if the gender of the person is unknown, or to purposely be ambiguous, or neither male nor female. Some people choose to use 'they' as their pronouns. Singular 'they' is conjugated the same way as the plural form, similar to the matching conjugations of the plural and singular 'you' in English. Singular 'they' is never used for objects, only people.
'They' can also be used to refer to a generic group of people, such as "In Britain, they celebrate Christmas in December".

Military gliders (a variation of the common glider) have been used by the military of various countries for carrying troops and heavy equipment into a war zone. They were used mainly during the Second World War. These aircraft with no engines were towed into the air and most of the way to their target by military transport planes. One of the most popular tow aircraft was the C-47 Skytrain or Dakota. They could also be towed by bombers. Military gliders do not soar. Once released from the tow craft near the front lines, they were to land on any convenient open terrain close to their target. 
They tried to landed with as little damage as possible to the cargo and crew as possible. But most landing zones (LZ) were far from ideal. The one-way nature of the missions meant that military gliders were treated as being disposable. This is why they were made from common and inexpensive materials such as wood. They were unarmored, fragile, aircraft with crude steering and no brakes. This is why a large number of them crashed on landing. Troops landing by glider were referred to as airborne infantry. Pilots called themselves "tow targets" while the soldiers referred to the gliders as "flying coffins." Casualties for some missions ran as high as 40%. 
Gilders had certain advantages, however. Paratroopers, soldiers landing by parachute, were usually spread over a large area. They could easily be separated from other paratroopers and from air-dropped equipment, such as vehicles and anti-tank guns. Gliders, on the other hand, could land troops and equipment precisely at the target landing area. Once released from the tow aircraft, military gliders were silent and difficult for the enemy to identify. Larger gliders were developed to land heavy equipment like anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft guns, small vehicles, such as jeeps, and also light tanks (e.g., the Tetrarch tank). This heavier equipment made glider forces much more capable. During World War II, the United States had about 6,000 trained glider pilots. Some were given a second chance to fly as glider pilots after failing to complete conventional aircraft training. The Soviets also experimented with ways to deliver light tanks by air, including the Antonov A-40, a gliding tank with detachable wings.
By the time of the Korean War, helicopters had largely replaced gliders. Helicopters have the advantage of being able to deliver and extract soldiers to and from the battlefield with more precision. Also, modern advances allow even light tanks to be dropped by parachute. Only special forces use gliders for silent, small-scale insertion today.

Cannabis, also known as marijuana, weed, sativa, and indica (as well as other names) is a psychoactive drug from the "Cannabis" plant used for medical or recreational purposes. (in legalized states). The main psychoactive part of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), one of the 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 65 other cannabinoids, which are chemicals only found in Cannabis. Cannabis can be used by smoking, vaporizing, within food, or as an extract.
Cannabis is mostly used recreationally or medically although like other psychoactive drugs it may also be used for spiritual purposes. In 2013, between 128 and 232 million people used cannabis (2.7% to 4.9% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). It is the most commonly used illegal drug in the world, though it is legal in some jurisdictions, with the highest use among adults () in Zambia, the United States, Canada, and Nigeria. Recently many states have begun to legalize cannabis for recreational use. Marijuana is becoming more widely used. 
Marijuana plants are grouped into 3 categories: Sativa, Indica, and Hybrid. A hybrid is a combination of Sativa and Indica. Sativa is an upper strand whilst indica is a downer. These 3 categories are then divided and categorized more into different strains. Strains are minor differences in how you feel when you use Cannabis. Some of the most famous and well-known strains of marijuana are: Acapulco Gold, Gelato, Grape Ape, White Widow, Purple Haze, Skunk and G13.

A dictator was the senior magistrate of the Roman Republic. They were regularly appointed from the earliest period of the Republic down to the Second Punic War.
Dictators had the full authority of the state to deal with a military emergency or to undertake a specific duty. The right of the Tribune of the plebs to veto his actions was extremely limited. However, to prevent the dictatorship from threatening the state itself, limitations were placed on his powers. A dictator had a clear sphere of authority. He had to resign once his task was done, or after six months. 
After the Second Punic War, no dictators were appointed for over a century. Then the idea was revived by Sulla, and later by Caesar. Sulla was a tyrant, and Caesar was murdered soon after becoming dictator.
The office was formally abolished after the death of Caesar, and not revived under the Empire.

He died, but his fame outlived the Roman empire.

SPQR are the initials of a Latin phrase "Senātus Populusque Rōmānus". It means "The Senate and People of Rome". 
It refers to the government of the ancient Roman Republic. It is still used as an official emblem of the modern-day municipality of Rome. 
SPQR appears on Roman coins, at the end of documents made public by inscription in stone or metal, in dedications of monuments and public works, and on the flag (vexilloid) of the Roman legions.
The phrase appears in Roman political, legal and historical literature, such as the speeches of Cicero and "Ab Urbe Condita Libri" ("Books from the Founding of the City") of Livy.
The date of first use of SPQR is not known. It first appears in inscriptions of the later Republic, from about 80 BC onwards. It last appears on coins of Constantine the Great (ruled AD 312-337), the first Christian Roman emperor.
The signature continued in use under the Roman Empire. The emperors were considered the representatives of the people, although the decrees of the Senate were dictated by the wishes of the emperor.
Similar language in more modern political and social revolutions no doubt comes from this usage. During the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, SPQR was emblazoned on many public buildings in an attempt to promote his dictatorship as a "New Roman Empire"

Day of the Dead () is a Mexican holiday celebrated in Mexico known around the world by the skull painting face. It is celebrated by people of Mexico living in other places, especially the United States. Family and friends gather for this multi-day holiday to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died while creating an Ofrenda. They do Ofrenda on a altar at home and also on the grave. It is also to help support their spiritual journey. In 2008, the tradition was inscribed in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.
The origin of the day of the dead comes from a mix of culture. Aztec and Christian are the main influence of it. In some countries people use sugar skull painting for Halloween but it is not the same celebration. Everyone is welcomed to join in on the celebration, but nearly everyone in Mexico celebrates it. The Day of the Dead is a holiday celebrated all throughout Mexico. It is a day to celebrate, remember and prepare special foods in honor of those who have died. The traditional food is the bread of the dead (pan de muertos). People paint there faces to match Caleveras. The famous decoration is the skulls, Marigolds, and candles. People believe the spirit of the dead goes and visits their families from October 31 (aka Halloween) then leaves on November 2. The Day of the Dead is held every year on the of November in Mexico. This Mexican holiday is celebrated because families do it to honor their loved ones who have passed.

SMS Posen was a German battleship built in 1907 and launched in 1910. She had twelve 11 inch guns in six turrets.
The ship sailed during most of the First World War, in the North Sea. The main battle she was in was the Battle of Jutland where she hit another German ship which then sank. 
The ship served with her three sister ships for the majority of World War I. She saw extensive service in the North Sea, where she took part in several fleet sorties. These culminated in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916, where "Posen" was heavily engaged in night-fighting against British light forces. In the confusion, the ship accidentally rammed the light cruiser SMS "Elbing", which suffered serious damage and was scuttled later in the night.
The ship also conducted several deployments to the Baltic Sea against the Russian Navy. In the first of these, "Posen" supported a German naval assault in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga. The ship was sent back to the Baltic in 1918 to support the White Finns in the Finnish Civil War. At the end of the war, "Posen" remained in Germany while the majority of the fleet was interned in Scapa Flow. In 1919, following the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow, she was ceded to the British as a replacement for the ships that had been sunk. She was then sent to ship-breakers in the Netherlands and scrapped in 1922.

History.
Posen was first ordered in 1906 as the Ersatz Baden. She started being built on 11 June 1907 in secret. She sailed for the first time in December 1908. She cost the German government 36,920,000 Marks.

The seven sages were Kashyapa, Atri, Vashitha, Vishvamitra, Gautam, Jamdagni, and Bharadvaja. According to Hindu mythology, these seven sages had become like divine beings. Ancient astrology of Hindus identified these seven sages with the stars of the sky, the Great Bear. Their wives formed the Pleiades.
The Rig Veda has several 'hymns' that go with his name. Sage Gautam is one of the greatest amongst all Saptarshis (seven sages). He was the son of Rahugana. He married to Ahalya and had two sons Vamadeva and Nodhas both themselves discoverers of Mantras. Ramayan and Mahabharatha have references to Sage Gautam as he lived during these two Yugas.

Bodo (��') or Boro is a Sino-Tibetan language spoken primarily by the Bodo people of Northeast India. It is official language of the Bodoland autonomous region and co-official language of the state of Assam in India. It is also one of twenty two languages listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India. The Bodo language has been written using Devanagari script since 1963. Some scholar believe that at ancient time boro language were written in "Deodhai" script which is now lost.
History and linguistic classification.
Bodo is a Sino-Tibetan language of the Bodo group. It is closely related to the Dimasa language and Tiwa (Lalung) Language of Assam. It is also related to the Garo language of Meghalaya and the Kokborok language of Tripura. The Bodo speaking areas of Assam stretch from Dhubri in the west to Sadiya in the east. In Alipurduar, Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri and other parts of Bengal, the Boros are known as "Mech". According to the 1991 census, the population of Boro speakers was 1,984,569 (Bodo 1,324,748), (Mech 659,821). The census reports of Bodo tribe, however, includes only the Bodos. It excludes the Mech tribe. The word "Boro" means the language and the community. It is pronounced with a high tone on the second syllable.
Dialects.
The dialects spoken in this area can be divided into three main groups:
The Western Boro dialects are spoken in the districts of Kokrajhar and Bongaigaon. The Eastern Bodo dialects are found mainly in the districts of Barpeta, Nalbari and Kamrup and some parts of Darrang. The Western Boro dialect has gained the status of a standard dialect. It has also developed a written form. The variations between these two dialect groups are mainly phonological and lexical.
The Bodo language of Assam has at least four clear-cut dialect-areas with a sufficient number of dialectal variations. There are the northeastern, southwestern, north-central and southern dialect areas. Each has distinct differences.
Geographic distribution.
"Ethnologue" lists the following districts where Bodo is spoken. Bodo is spoken mainly in the lowlands and foothills of Assam and West Bengal.
History.
Although the Bodo language is a rich and ancient language, it did not have any written literature until the second decade of the 20th century. Christian missionaries, who entered the Bodo speaking areas to preach their religion, published some books on religion, tales, rhymes and songs. These missionaries also published some books on grammar and dictionary. Reverend Sidney Endle compiled "An Outline of the Kachari Grammar" in 1884. The grammar is based on the dialect of Darrang district. Endle also wrote an important book on the Bodos. It is titled "The Kacharis". The book was published in 1911 and it contains chapters on social customs, agriculture practices, festivities, food habits, rituals, crafts and textiles of the Bodos. The book also included examples of Bodo folktales, rhymes and grammars. J.D. Anderson's "Collection of Bodo Folktales and Rhymes" (1895) included seventeen Bodo folktales translated into the English language. This is in addition to the original versions in the Bodo language.
In 1963 the language was used in teaching in the primary schools in Bodo dominated areas. The Bodo language is used in schools up to the secondary level. The language has become a matter of pride with the opening of the post-graduate course in the Bodo language. Bodo literature has been used in the University of Guwahati since 1996. The Bodo language now has a large number of books of poetry, drama, short stories, novels, biography, travel, children's literature and literary criticism. Though the spoken language has been affected by other communities and dialects, it is still to be heard in its pure form in and around the Udalguri district.
Writing system.
The language is officially written using the Devanagari script. It also has a long history of using the Latin script and the Assamese script. Some researchers have suggested that at one time the language used a now-lost script called Deodhai.

"The Fall of Nineveh" is a poem by English poet Edwin Atherstone (1788-1892).
"The Fall of Nineveh" is a long poem. It consists of the Prelude and thirty books. It was published in parts between 1828 and 1868. It has more than six hundred pages and more than twenty thousand lines. Because of that it is one of the longest epic poems in English and European literature. Nineveh was the capital city of the Assyrian empire. It was really destroyed in 612 B.C. 
Author.
Edwin Atherstone was a romantic poet. He is forgotten now. He was the author of some poems, dramas and two novels, "Sea kings in England" and "Handwriting on the Wall".
Form.
The poem is written almost entirely in blank verse. This form, unrhymed iambic pentameter, is typical for long poems in English literature. It was introduced into English literature by Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey in 16th century. It was widely used in Elizabethan drama, for example by Thomas Kyd and William Shakespeare. In 17th century John Milton employed it in "Paradise Lost". From that time blank verse prevails in English epic poems. From time to time the poet used alliteration: "Thus in her pride of power I see her now;/Her swarming streets; her splendid festivals;/Her sprightly damsels" ("The Prelude").
Sources.
The poem is based on the strory written by Greek physician and historian Ctesias. Lord Byron wrote a tragedy about Sandanapalus earlier.
Story.
The poem narrates about a great war. It was a conflict between the Assyrian and the coallition of nations that had been conquered by them earlier. The Assyrian were ruled by Sardanapalus, king of Nineveh. He was a tyrant. All the nations around had to pay high taxes and send some soldiers to the king. They did not want to do it any longer. They started a war for independence. After many battles they won the whole war. They took the city of Nineveh, but it was destroyed by an earthquake.
Reception.
Edwin Atherstone's poems were never much appreciated by critics. Sometimes he was even called "stupid".
Translation.
"The Fall of Niniveh" has not been probably translated in any language. There are only some fragments in Polish translation.

Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare genetic disorder.
Ultraviolet (UV) light damages the DNA in skin cells. Normally the DNA damage is repaired. But if a person has a defective repair gene, the DNA is not repaired.
Consequences.
This disease causes the skin to be sensitive to sunlight. A person with this disorder must always stay out of the sun, or they will get a sunburn. People with this disease are often called a "Moon child" because they can only go outside during the night. This disease is present in both genders and in all races, with one in 250,000 people living in the US having this disease. A Japanese person is about six times more likely to have this disease.
This disorder is found in one in 250,000 people. People with xeroderma pigmentosum are about 1,000 times more likely to get skin cancer.
There is no cure for xeroderma pigmentosum. The symptoms can be minimized if you do not go outside into sunlight. Fewer than 40% of individuals with the disease survive beyond the age of 20. Some XP victims with less severe cases do manage to live well into their 40s.
People that have xeroderma pigmentosum are sensitive to UV light from the sun, and have dry, flaking skin and pigmented spots that can become skin cancer. 
Other symptoms include:
The most important part of treatment is avoiding going into sunlight. You may have to wear protective clothes and wear sunscreen.
Technical note.
XP can be caused by mutations in any one of eight genes. Seven of these genes help repair of ultraviolet-induced photoproducts.

Priscus of Panium () was a Roman diplomat and Greek historian from the 5th century AD.
Biography.
Priscus was born between 410 and 420 AD in Panium (or Panion), Thrace. He joined in 448/449 AD the Roman embassy, led by Maximinus and speaking on behalf of Emperor Theodosius II, on a diplomatic mission to the court of Attila the Hun. While he was there, Priscus met and spoke with a Greek trader dressed in Hunnic clothes who was captured in around 441–442 AD when the Huns pillaged the city of Viminacium in modern Serbia. The trader then told Priscus that he was a slave of a Hunnic nobleman named Onegesius, but got his freedom and chose to live among the Huns. Priscus finally had a debate with the Greek defector about life and justice in both the Roman Empire and in barbarian kingdoms.
Priscus traveled to Rome, Alexandria, and Egypt. In around 456 AD, he was with the staff of Euphemios as the "magister officiorum" of Emperor Marcian. Priscus died after 472 AD.
Writings.
Priscus wrote in the Greek language a history of the Byzantine Empire in eight books. The books probably covered the time from the rise of Attila the Hun to the rise of Emperor Zeno, or from 433 up until 474 AD. Priscus was very influential in the empire and his books were used by different writers: Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus ("Excerpta de Legationibus"), Evagrius Scholasticus, Cassiodorus, Jordanes, and author of the Suda. The style of Priscus's writing is direct and his work is considered a trustworthy account of Attila the Hun, his court, and the admission of the Roman ambassadors. Priscus relied on a style of historiography that was part of an ancient Greek tradition dating back to the 5th century BC.
Collections.
The books of Priscus are published in four collections:

Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu (1405 – 17 January 1468), known as Skanderbeg ( from , "İskender Bey"; Latin:,) was an Albanian nobleman and military commander. He led a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in what is today Albania, North Macedonia, Greece, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia.
Reputation.
Because he defended his principality (the Principality of Kastrioti) against Ottoman influences, he was given the Latin title "Athleta Christi" (meaning "warrior of Christianity") by Pope Callixtus III. Today, many people see him as an Albanian national hero. 
He was only able to hold his own possessions within the very small area in today's northern Albania. This is where almost all of his victories against the Ottomans took place. Skanderbeg's military skills were a major obstacle to Turkish expansion, and many in western Europe thought he was a model of Christian resistance against the Muslim Turks. For 25 years, from 1443 to 1468, Skanderbeg's 10,000-man army marched through Ottoman territory, winning against larger and better-supplied Ottoman forces. He was greatly admired for this.
The Albanians honor him and his 25 victories by including 25 wings on the Albanian black eagle.

François Mathey(August 17, 1917 in Ronchamp (Haute-Saône) – January 3, 1993 in Coulommiers, Seine-et-Marne) was a French museum curator. He was curator, then chief curator at the Museum of Decorative Arts from 1953 to 1985.
In 1967, Mathey succeeded in bringing Jean Dubuffet's personal collection into an "institution", the museum of decorative arts, even though the artist rejected academic structures. Mathey was interested in the artist Jean-Joseph Sanfourche, who was selected for important exhibitions "Des singuliers de l'art" in 1978 at the Museum of Modern Art of the City of Paris and at the Museum of Decorative Arts, in 1980, as part of the "international heritage year".

Evening gloves are long gloves for women's formal wear. These gloves are often worn with evening dress for debutante(ball gown) and wedding dresses. The longest of the evening gloves are called the "opera gloves". Opera gloves are very long gloves that go far beyond the elbow.
The appropriate length of the evening gloves is determined by the length of the sleeves of the dress. The shorter the sleeves of the dress, the longer the gloves should be. Evening gloves for formal(white tie) and semi-formal(black tie) wear come in three lengths for women: wrist, elbow, and opera. The opera reaches over the elbow, usually reaching to the biceps but sometimes to the full length of the arm. The "elbow-length or longer" part is the key; gloves which cover a substantial portion of the forearm, up to just below the elbow, can legitimately be called "long gloves" or "evening gloves", but never "Opera Gloves". In this case, the term "opera" is the same as "opera length necklace" or "opera length stockings" and refers to the length of the object rather than the type of party.
The most formal fabric for evening gloves is kidskin (young goats leather). The most expensive opera length gloves are custom-made of kidskin. Many other types of leather, most usually soft varieties of cowhide, are used in making full-length gloves; patent leather and suede are especially popular as alternatives to kidskin, and are often more affordable than kidskin. Satin and stretch satin materials are extremely popular, and there are mass-produced varieties as well. More unusual glove materials include leathers made from salmon, python, and stingray.

The esperanza tree frog ("Charadrahyla esperancensis") is a frog that lives in Mexico. Scientists have seen it in Oaxaca at 1640 meters above sea level.
Appearance.
The adult male frog is 44.3 to 48.9 mm long from nose to rear end.
This frog has smooth skin on its back and legs. It has bumpy skin on its belly. The top of the head and top of the back are either light brown or green-brown in color. The sides of the head has dark brown color from the nose to the eardrum. The sides of the frog's body are dark brown with yellow spots. The spots are not perfectly round. The tops of the legs are light brown with darker brown stripes going across. The legs have yellow spots. This frog has disks on its toes for climbing. The disks are darker in color than the rest of the toe. The belly is light in color.
Name.
"Esperanza" is "hope" in Spanish. Scientists named after the place where they saw the frog: La Esperanza in Sierra Juarez.
Threats.
This frog is in some danger of dying out. This is because human beings change the places where it lives by cutting down trees to have wood or make towns and cities. This cuts the place where the frog lives into small pieces, where frogs in different places cannot go to each other. This makes them make young only with other frogs nearby, and they may be too closely realted to each other. These frogs also die from disease and climate change.
Human beings who live near La Esperanza have saved 4000 hectares of land to save this frog and other animals that live there.

The United States of Europe (USE for short) is the idea that the countries of the European Union (EU for short) will unite into a single sovereign state. It would be similar to the United States of America (USA for short).
The USE would have much more influence (politically, economically, militarily, culturally, etc.) at the international level than an EU member country alone. It would be the world's third most populous country with a population of almost 450 million people. The economy of the USE would be the world's third-largest by GDP with almost 14 trillion euros.
Some critics believe that there will not be a USE in the near future because they think that:
-countries do not want to give up their national language for an official language of the USE
-countries do not want to give up their national identity
-countries with a small population do not want to end up as federal states with little voting weight

Scientist tell whether a frog is a "Bokermannohyla" frog using 65 specific parts of the DNA in its nucleus and mitochondria. These genes are for proteins and ribosomes.
This group is named after scientist Werner Carlos Agosto Bokermann.
Size.
With most frogs, the adult female frog is larger than the adult male frog. But with some frogs in Bokermannohyla, the adult male frog is larger. Scientists say this happens when the male frogs fight each other for good places to find female frogs.

The PS General Slocum was a ship. It was a steam ship. One June 15, 1904, it caught fire in the East River in New York. More than 1000 people died.
Making.
The PS Slocum was built in 1891. It had a sidewheel system. It was a paddle boat. It was a passenger ship. The Solcum was built to take as many as 2500 passengers. It had 2500 life vests. In May 1904, a fire inspector looked at the ship and said its fire stopping tools were in "fine working order."
Disaster.
St. Mark's Evangelical Lutheran Church was on the Lower East Side of Manhattan island. It was in a German-American neighborhood called "Kleindeutschland", or "Little Germany." The church paid the Knickerbocker Steamboat Company $350 for the General Slocum to take a special trip. The trip was to celebrate the end of the school year. Not everyone who came on the trip was German-American. Churchgoers invited their friends and neighbors to come too. Most people wore their best clothes. The people on the boat planned to go to Locust Grove on Long Island's North Shore for the day. They brought baskets of food for picnics. There were 1,358 people on the boat in total, passengers and crew. Most of the passengers were women and children.
The ship left Manhattan at 9:00 a.m. Before 9:30, something on the ship began to burn. The ship caught fire. People had to decide whether to burn on the boat or jump into the water. Most people in 1904 New York could not swim. The clothes people wore in 1904 New York became very heavy when they got wet, so even people who could swim a little were pulled down into the river.
The crew tried to put out the fire with fire hoses. But the hoses were old and broke apart. There were life vests on the ship, but they were so old that they only sank into the water. They had been made with cork, but the cork had turned to powder. The life boats were old and could not float. The crew had not done any fire drills. The crew did not know what to do when the passengers became frightened.
The captain, William Henry Van Schaick, tried to find a place to land, and he chose North Brother Island a mile away. He made the ship move very fast. This made the fire worse.
Some people saw the fire and tried to help. Tug boats came to the ship. The people tried to pull people from the General Slocum out of the water. Mostly, they found dead bodies, but the people on the tug boats pulled dozens of living people out of the water. A ship from the New York Yacht Club came near the General Slocum, but the man on it only watched.
The ship came to North Brother Island. The island had a hospital on it for people with typhoid. The people in the hospital blew their fire whistle. They brought hoses and equipment to put out the fire. Nurses threw ropes and anything that would float to people in the water. Some nurses jumped into the water and swam to pull people out. But the fire was very hot and many people burned to death.
321 people lived. 1021 died. This was the highest number of dead people from one thing in New York City until the September 11 attacks in 2001. The river water washed dead bodies onto the ground for days.
Blame and trial.
People are not sure how the fire started, but it could have been from a match or cigarette falling onto some hay.
Frank A. Barnaby, the President of the Knickerbocker Steamboat Company, said the captain and crew had done well.
People said Captain Van Schaick decided not to steer the ship back to the city when the fire started. They said this was because of insurance. But it may not be true. Van Schaick steered the ship toward North Brother Island. Van Schaick said this was because he would have had to land the ship near 130th street near the Bronx, which had wood yards and gas tanks.
Captain Van Shaick was put on trial in a United States Circuit Court for criminal negligence. On Janaury 27, 1906, he was found guilty. They said the disaster was his fault because he did not make the crew do fire drills. Judge Thomas sentenced him to 10 years hard labor. The Knickerbocker Steamboat Company was not punished.
Van Schaick went to Sing Sing prison. His wife asked President William Howard Taft to pardon him. Taft did in 1911.
Communities.
The German-American community in Manhattan changed after the disaster. Many people whose families had died killed themselves or were so sad that it became an illness. The Jewish-American and Italian-American communities lost many people too. There is a marble monument to the people who died in Tompkins Square Park. The Sympathy Society of German Ladies put it there in 1906.
Because most of the people on the boat were women and children, many German-American men suddenly had no wives or children. Many of them moved north to be nearer the place where their families had died. Soon, there was a German-American neighborhood on the Upper East Side. The Kleindeutschland neighborhood faded away. New people from Poland and Russia came to live there instead.

The Oxyrhynchus hymn is a Christian Greek religious song with lyrics and musical notation from the 3rd century AD. The hymn was written on a manuscript that was discovered in 1918 in modern Egypt, published in 1922, and now preserved in Oxford University.
Description.
The lyrics of the Oxyrhynchus hymn were written in the Greek language. They use poetry to summon silence in praise of the Holy Trinity, a motif of ancient Greek hymns called "cosmic stillness". The music of the Oxychynchus hymn is composed in Greek vocal notation. Overall, the Oxyrhynchus hymn illustrates the historical continuity of Greek culture where educated Christian Greeks accepted and used the musical notation of their ancient Greek ancestors. Also, it is the only surviving piece of Christian Greek music from the first 400 years of Christianity.
Text.
The Phos Hilaron and the Oxyrhynchus hymn are the earliest existing Greek hymns used in Christian worship, but are not based on the Bible.

Brookmerland is a "Samtgemeinde" ("collective municipality") in Aurich, in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is southeast of Norden. Its seat is in the village Marienhafe.
The "Samtgemeinde" Brookmerland has the following municipalities:

Lütetsburg (East Frisian Low Saxon: "Lütsbörg") is a municipality in Aurich, in Lower Saxony, Germany.

Norden (East Frisian Low Saxon: "Nörden") is a town in Aurich, in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is on the North Sea shore, in East Frisia.
Town and land use.
Norden has the town itself and ten official subdistricts. In addition to the old town centre, the main town includes the previous municipality of Sandbauerschaft and the subdistricts Ekel, Lintel and Westgaste. They are divided into many quarters and residential areas such as Neustadt, Westlintel, Ostlintel, Ekelergaste, In der Wirde, Vierzig Diemat, Martensdorf, or "millionaire quarter". They have in common that they do not have any administrative function, but are places referred to in everyday local language.
The other subdistricts are Bargebur, Leybuchtpolder, Norddeich, Westermarsch I, Westermarsch II, Southderneuland I, Southderneuland II and Tidofeld.
The main town and the villages of Bargebur, Norddeich, Süderneneuland I and Süderneuland II, as well as parts of Westermarsch II, have largely grown together, and with the exception of Norddeich and Westermarsch II, form extensive residential and commercial areas in the south and east of the borough. About 92.5% of the total urban population live in this "metropolitan area". The remaining subdistricts continue to be very rural and mostly barely populated, but they occupy by far the largest share of the total area of the borough.

Specials is a short Unicode block of characters put at the very end of the Basic Multilingual Plane, at U+FFF0–FFFF. Of these 16 code points, five have been used since Unicode 3.0:
FFFE and FFFF are not unused in the usual way, but guaranteed not to be Unicode characters at all. They can be used to guess a text's scheme, since any text using these is not a correctly encoded Unicode text. Unicode's character can be put at the start of a Unicode text to signal its endianness: a program reading such a text and finding 0xFFFE would then know that it should switch the byte order for all the following characters.
Its block name in Unicode 1.0 was Special.
Replacement character.
The replacement character (�) (often displayed as a black rhombus with a white question mark) is a symbol found in the Unicode standard at code point U+FFFD in the "Specials" table. It is used for problems when something is unable to render a stream of data to a correct symbol. It is usually seen when the data is not valid and does not match any character:
Consider a text file containing the German word (meaning 'for') in the ISO-8859-1 encoding (codice_1). This file is now opened with a text editor that thinks that the input is UTF-8. The first and last byte are valid UTF-8 encodings of ASCII, but the middle byte (codice_2) is not a valid byte in UTF-8. So, a text editor could replace this byte with the replacement character symbol to make a valid string of Unicode code points. The whole string now looks like this: "f�r".
A poorly made text editor might save the replacement character in UTF-8, and the text file data will then look like this: codice_3, which will be displayed in ISO-8859-1 as "fï¿1⁄2r" (this is called mojibake). Since the replacement is the same for all errors this makes it impossible to get the first character. A better (but harder to make) way is to keep the original bytes, including the error, and only convert to the replacement when "displaying" the text. This will allow the text editor to save the original byte sequence, while still showing the error to the user.
At one time the replacement character was used a lot when there was no glyph that can be used in a font for that character. However, most new text rendering systems instead use a font's character, which most times is an empty box (or "?" or "X" in a box), sometimes called a "tofu" (this browser displays 􏿾). There is no Unicode point for this symbol.
So, the replacement character is now only seen for encoding errors, such as invalid UTF-8. Some software tries to hide this by translating the bytes of invalid UTF-8 to matching characters in Windows-1252 (since that is the most likely source of these errors), so that the replacement character is never seen.
History.
The following Unicode-related documents record the purpose and process of defining specific characters in the Specials block:

Magnetic ink allows a computer to read characters even if they have been covered with signatures, cancellation marks, bank stamps, or other marks. MICR lines help facilitate automatic check-clearing when banks send their checks to central processing systems at the end of the day.
How it is made.
A ferrofluid is used in the manufacturing of the magnetic ink. A ferrofluid consists of colloidal particles (nanoscale) composed of iron(II) and iron(III) compounds such as FeCl2 and FeCl3. A ferrofluid is attracted by a magnetic field but does not become permanently magnetized.

The voiced alveolar lateral fricative is a type of consonant. Some spoken languages use it. The letter for this sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet is (sometimes called "lezh"). The X-SAMPA symbol for this sound is codice_1. The voiced alveolar lateral fricative is not used in English.
Examples.
Alveolar.
A pharyngealized voiced alveolar lateral fricative is reconstructed to be the ancient Classical Arabic pronunciation of the Arabic letter . (This means that linguists do not know how the letter was actually pronounced. However, by looking at modern languages, they think that this is how it was pronounced in the ancient language.) Today, the letter is pronounced in Modern Standard Arabic as a pharyngealized voiced coronal stop. This sound can be either alveolar or denti-alveolar .
Notation.
In 1938, a letter shaped similarly to heng was approved as the official IPA letter for this sound. It replaced . However, the International Phonetic Association also suggested that a compromise between the two letters could be used if the author wanted. This compromise letter was included in the 1949 "Principles of the International Phonetic Association" and the IPA charts of that year. Although the International Phonetic Association said to use this letter, some authors still used from the 1960s to the 1980s. Later, this new letter was replaced by at the 1989 Kiel Convention.

Scarthyla is a genus of tree frogs in the family Hylidae. They live in the Amazon Basin in Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil. They also live in Colombia and Venezuela and in some Caribbean countries. These frogs are called Madre de Dios treefrogs and South American aquatic treefrogs. They spend time in the water but not all their time.
Species.
The genus contains two species:

In physics, chemistry and thermodynamics, equations of state are used to describe the state a dynamical system is in. . Equations of state are commonly used to describe the state of gases and fluids. In the real world, equations of state are approximations. They can be quite complex to write down, and usually, they are solved using numerical methods.
Variables.
There are certain variables such as pressure, volume, or temperature, that can be used to describe such a system. So in its simplest form, an equation of state is a function, that takes these dependent variables as input, the state can then be as simple as saying that in its current state, the function has the numerical value zero:
formula_1
where p ist the pressure, V is the volume, and T is the temperature.
Ideal gas.
The simplest of these describes an ideal gas, it is the ideal gas law. This law can also be used to describe the state of real gases, in certain conditions (such as with a low pressure, and high temperature). 

Choucroute garnie is a dish that can be found in the eastern parts of France, in Switzerland, Germany and Austria. In essence, it consists of Sauerkraut, with different types of sausages, and other cooked meat is added. Very often, potatoes are added too. There are many regional variations, and there's no set recipe. Most often, the sauerkraut is served with three or four different kinds of sausage, potatoes and other cooked meat. The types of sausages which are used are Morteau sausage, Saucisson vaudois, and Frankfurter. Other cooked, usually salty meat is commonly added, as are potatoes.
In other regions of France, there are also recipes with fish, shellfish and mussels.
Riesling, or another kind of white wine is used to prepare it. The version that uses Champagne instead is often called "Choucroute royale". 
At the base, choucrote garnie is a dish of the common people, that is cheap to prepare. There are higher-priced versions that use foie gras, or deer. Many grands chefs also prepare their version.

Tea plants grown in Nepal, are used to make tea. This tea is called Nepali tea. These plants look, smell, and taste a bit different from other tea plants. They are similar to the tea plants grown in Darjeeling, which are used to make Darjeeling tea. This may be because the eastern parts of Nepal are geographically similar to the Darjeeling region. Darjeeling produces a lot more tea than Nepal. For this reason, tea from Nepal is not as well-known. 
There are two types of Nepali tea:
Orthodox tea.
Like Darjeeling Tea, Orthodox Tea is made from the Chinese variety of tea plants. The tea is rolled by hand, or using a machine. Most speciality teas like green tea, oolong tea, white tea, and hand rolled tea fall under the category of orthodox tea. In Nepal, Orthodox Tea is produced and processed in the mountain regions, at altitudes between and . There are six major districts, primarily in the eastern regions of Nepal that are known for producing quality orthodox tea. They are Ilam, Panchthar, Dhankuta, Terhathum, Sindhulpalchok and Kaski.
Flushes.
With Nepali tea, the time of the year, when it is collected, is also recorded. There are four main times, called "flushes"
CTC tea.
Crush, tear, curl (CTC) tea is a method of processing the Assam variety "(Camellia sinensis" var. "assamica)". It grows at a lower altitude, where the climate is hot and humid. Most of it is grown on the plains of the Jhapa district. Most tea drunk in Nepal is of this variety, almost 95%. Because it is easier to produce, it is also cheaper than orthodox tea. 
The Nepal CTC tea also has four pronounced flushes, the First, Second, Monsoon and Autumn flushes, but unlike the orthodox tea, the CTC tea is more or less uniform throughout, often showing a strong color and subtle aroma after infusion. However, the flushes do not begin and end in accordance with that of the orthodox tea, mainly because of differences in local conditions.

Kitana is a fictional character in the "Mortal Kombat" electronic game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. 
Appearance.
Kitana appeared for the first time in the "Mortal Kombat II" (1993) game, where she is shown as a royal from Edenia, a fictional realm (kingdom). In the game, she uses a pair of fans made of steel, also named "tessenjutsu". Kitana uses these fans to make special attacks.
Story.
She was thought to be the daughter of Shao Kahn, the emperor of the Outworld. However, Kitana later learns her true father was murdered by Kahn when he conquered Edenia. Later on, she becomes an important hero as she joins warriors of the Earthrealm to make sure her realm is freed. Kitana is the love interest of hero Liu Kang.
Outside the games.
The character has appeared in various media outside of the games and is one of its most iconic and popular fighters.

Llico was one of the communes that was part of the department of Vichuquén, in the province of Curicó.
The 1907 Chilean census established it had a population of 8.430 inhabitants.
History.
The commune was created by decree of 22 December 1891, with the territory of Llico and Iloca subdelegations.
It was suppressed by the Decree with Force of Law No. 8.583, on 30 December 1927, by dictator Carlos Ibáñez del Campo as part of a greater political and administrative reform, adding its territory to the commune of Vichuquén. The commune was effectively suppressed on 1 February 1928.

Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni (8 June 1671 – 17 January 1751) was a Venetian composer. He wrote operas and instrumental music. He is best remembered as the composer of a work called "Adagio in G Minor". Albinoni did not actually write the Adagio.
Life.
Albinoni was born in Venice. He learned to play the violin and to sing. It is not known who his teachers are. His first opera, "Zenobia, regina de Palmireni", was performed in Venice in 1694.
In 1705, he married Margherita Rimondi, a soprano singer. 
He became famous and he performed his operas in many Italian cities, including Venice, Genoa, Bologna, Mantua, Udine, Piacenza, and Naples. He also wrote and published instrumental music during this time. Albinoni did not try to find a job in a church or a court. He remained an independent composer and published music on his own.
He retired from writing music after 1741, and died in Venice in 1751.
Music.
Most of Albinoni's operas are lost. This is because he did not publish his operas during his life. His instrumental music has survived. Nine collections of instrumental music were published. Because of this, he is better known for writing instrumental music today. He is the first Italian composer to publish an oboe concerto.
He was known by Johann Sebastian Bach, who wrote at least two fugues based on themes by Albinoni.

This is a list of numbers. This list will always be not finished. This happens because there are an infinite amount of numbers. Only numbers will be added. Numbers can be added as long as they are popular in math, history or culture.
This means that numbers can only be if they are a big part of history. A number isn't if it is only related to another number. For example, the number (3,4) is a number when it is a complex number (3+4i). When it is only (3,4), however, it's not notable.
Natural numbers.
Natural numbers are a type of integer. They can be used for counting. Natural numbers can also be used to find out about other number systems. A negative number is not a natural number.
0 is argued on whether or not it is a natural number. To fix this, people use the terms "non-negative integers", which cover 0 and "positive integers", which does not.
Classes of natural numbers.
Prime numbers.
A prime number is a type of natural number. It only has two divisors: 1 and itself.
Highly composite numbers.
A highly composite number is a type of natural number. It has more divisors than any smaller natural number. They are used a lot in geometry, grouping, and time measurement.
The first 20 highly composite numbers are:
1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, 720, 840, 1260, 1680, 2520, 5040, 7560
Perfect numbers.
A perfect number is a type of integer. It has the sum of its positive divisors (all divisors except itself).
The first 10 perfect numbers:
Integers.
Integers are a set of numbers. They usually are in arithmetic and number theory. There are many subsets of integers. These can cover natural numbers, prime numbers, perfect numbers, etc.
Popular integers are −1 and 0.
Orders of magnitude.
Integers can be written in orders of magnitude. This can be written as 10"k", where "k" is an integer. If "k" = 0, 1, 2, 3, then the powers of ten for them are 1, 10, 100 and 1000. This is used in scientific notation.
Each number has its own prefix. Each prefix has its own symbol. For example, "kilo-" may be added to the beginning of "gram." This changes the meaning of "gram" to mean that the gram is 1000 times more than a gram: one kilogram is the same as 1000 grams.
Rational numbers.
A rational number is a number that can be written as a fraction with two integers. The numerator is written as formula_1. The denominator(which cannot be zero) is written as formula_2. Every integer is a rational number. This is because, in integers, 1 is always the denominator of a fraction.
Rational numbers can be written in infinitely many ways. For example, 0.12 can be written as "three twenty-fifths" (formula_3), "nine seventy-fifths" (formula_4), etc.
Irrational numbers.
Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be written as a fraction. These are written as algebraic numbers or transcendental numbers.
Real numbers.
The real numbers are a superset(or category) of numbers. They cover algebraic and transcendental numbers.
Hypercomplex numbers.
A hypercomplex number is a word for an element of a unital algebra over the field of real numbers.
Transfinite numbers.
Transfinite numbers are numbers that are "infinite". They are larger than any finite number. They are, however, not absolutely infinite.
Physical Constants.
Physical constants are constants that can be used in the universe to figure out information.

Sierra Entertainment was an American video game developer/publisher founded in the late 1970s by Ken and Roberta Williams.
Games.
The company is known for making the graphic adventure game genre, including the first game, Mystery House. It is also known for its adventure game series King's Quest, Space Quest, Police Quest, Gabriel Knight, Leisure Suit Larry, and Quest for Glory, as well as being the original publishers of Half-Life.
Affiliation.
After 17 years as a lone company, Sierra was bought by CUC International in February 1996 to become part of CUC Software. However, CUC International was caught in an scandal in 1998. Therefore many of the original founders of Sierra including the Williamses left the company. Sierra remained as part of CUC Software as it was sold and renamed several times over the next few years; Sierra was dissolved as a company and reformed as a division of this group in 2004. The former CUC Software group was acquired by Vivendi and branded as Vivendi Games in 2006. The Sierra division continued to operate through Vivendi Games' merger with Activision to form Activision Blizzard in 2008. However, it was shut down later. The Sierra brand was revived by Activision in 2014 to re-release former Sierra games and some independently developed games.
History.
Founding (1979 - 1982).
Sierra Entertainment was founded in 1979 as On-Line Systems in Simi Valley, California, by Ken and Roberta Williams. Ken, a programmer for IBM, had planned to use the company to create business software for the TRS-80 and Apple II. Ken had brought a teletype terminal home one day in 1979, and while looking through the host system's catalog of programs, discovered the text adventure "Colossal Cave Adventure". He encouraged Roberta to join him in playing it, and she was thrilled by the game; after Ken had brought an Apple II to their home, she played through other text adventures such as those by Scott Adams and Softape to study them. Dissatisfied with the text-only format, she realized that the graphics display capability of the Apple II could improve the adventure gaming experience. With Ken's help in some of the programming, Roberta designed "Mystery House", inspired by the novel "And Then There Were None" and the board game "Clue", using text commands and printout combined with graphics depicting the current setting.
On-Line Systems leased their first office space from Ponderosa Printing, a modest space in the back of a small town print shop.
Mystery House.
"Mystery House" was released in 1980. It was a great success with 15,000 copies sold, earning 167,000 American dollars (equivalent to 525,539 American dollars in 2020). It is the first computer adventure game to have graphics, although made with crude, static, monochrome line drawings. The two decided to shift the company's focus to developing more graphical adventure games. "Mystery House" became the first of their "Hi-Res Adventure" series. The "Hi-Res Adventure" series continued with "Mission Asteroid", which was released as "Hi-Res Adventure #0" though being the second release. The next release, "Wizard and the Princess", also known as "Adventure in Serenia", is considered a prelude to the later "King's Quest" series in both story and concept. Through 1981 and 1982, more games were released in the series including "Cranston Manor", "Ulysses and the Golden Fleece", "Time Zone", and "The Dark Crystal". A simplified version of "The Dark Crystal", intended for a younger audience, was written by Al Lowe and released as "Gelfling Adventure".
Rebranding (1982 - 1988).
On-Line Systems was renamed Sierra On-Line in 1982, and they moved to Oakhurst, California. The "Sierra" name was taken from the Sierra Nevada mountain range that Oakhurst was near, and its new logo had the image of a mountain reflecting that. By early 1984 "InfoWorld" estimated that Sierra was the world's 12th-largest microcomputer-software company, with $12.5 million in 1983 sales.
The company weathered the video game crash of 1983 by seeing only a 20% increase in sales, after analysts in 1982 had predicted a doubling in 1983 of the entire software market. The company had spent much of 1983 developing for a Commodore machine and the TI-99/4A which were both obsolete by the end of the year. Ken Williams was reportedly described as "bewildered by the pace at which computers come into and fall out of favor", and Williams said, "I've learned my lesson. I'm not moving until I understand the market better."
Many of Sierra's most well known series began in the 1980s. In 1983, Sierra On-Line was contacted by IBM to create a game for the new PCjr. IBM offered to fund the entire development and marketing of the game, paying royalties. Ken and Roberta Williams accepted and started on the project. Roberta Williams created a story featuring classic fairy-tale elements. Her game concept includes animated color graphics, a pseudo 3D-perspective where the main character is visible on the screen, a more competent text parser that understands advanced commands from the player, and music playing in the background through the PCjr sound hardware. For the game, a complete development system called Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) was developed. In mid-1984, "King's Quest: Quest for the Crown" was released to much acclaim, beginning the "King's Quest" series.
Sierra On-Line expanded into a larger headquarters in the early-1980s.
While working to finish "The Black Cauldron", programmers Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy began to plan for an adventure game of their own. After a simple demonstration to Ken Williams, he allowed them to start working on the full game, which was named "Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter". The game was released in October 1986 as an instant success, spawning many sequels in the "Space Quest" series in the following years.
Al Lowe, who had been working at Sierra On-Line for many years, was asked by Ken Williams to write a modern version of Chuck Benton's "Softporn Adventure" from 1981, the only pure text adventure that the company had ever released. "Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards" was a great hit and won the Software Publishers Association's Best Adventure Game award of 1987. It can be deduced that the game first became famous as an early example of software piracy, as Sierra sold many more hintbooks than actual copies of the game. A series of "Leisure Suit Larry" games followed.
Ken Williams befriended a retired highway patrol officer named Jim Walls and asked him to produce an adventure series based on a police theme. Walls proceeded to create "Police Quest: In Pursuit of the Death Angel", which was released in 1987. Several sequels followed, and the series was touted for adherence to police protocol (relevant parts of which were explained in the games' manuals), and presenting some real-life situations encountered by Walls during his career as an officer.
"Quest for Glory" is a series of hybrid adventure/role-playing video games designed by Corey and Lori Ann Cole. The first game in the series, "Quest for Glory: So You Want to Be a Hero", was released in 1989. The series combines humor, puzzle elements, themes and characters borrowed from various legends, puns, and memorable characters, creating a five-part series of the Sierra stable. Although the series was originally titled "Hero's Quest", Sierra failed to trademark the name. Milton Bradley successfully trademarked an electronic version of their unrelated joint Games Workshop board game, "HeroQuest," which forced Sierra to change the series' title to "Quest for Glory". This decision caused all future games in the series (as well as newer releases of "Hero's Quest I") to switch over to the new name.
In 1987, Sierra On-Line started to publish its own gaming magazine, about its upcoming games and interviews with the developers. The magazine was initially named "The Sierra Newsletter", "The Sierra News Magazine", and "The Sierra/Dynamix Newsmagazine". However, since Sierra Club already published a magazine called "Sierra Magazine", the name of the magazine published by Sierra On-Line was changed to "InterAction" in 1991. It was discontinued in 1999.
Sierra's Adventure Game Interpreter engine, introduced with "King's Quest", was replaced in 1988 with Sierra's Creative Interpreter in "King's Quest IV". The game was released under both engines, so those who had newer computers could use the new engine and better rendering technology.

The Grotte Mandrin is a cave near Montélimar. It is near the small French town Malaverne, in the Drôme department. It is more like a shelter, that protects from the weather, and not really a cave. It is an archeological site: There are many well-preserved finds from the transition from the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic. The oldest layer of finds is 120,000 years old.
It is named after the French folk hero Louis Mandrin. 
Location.
The Abri is about southeast of Malataverne town center. It is at the foot of an exposed limestone cliff at 245 m height. At the site, the valley is very narrow, only about . Important traffic routes pass through there: the A7, N7, D169 and the high-speed line LGV Méditerranée .
Topography.
Today, the Grotte Mandrin has a depth of . At some point part of it collapsed. Today, large boulders on the slope below are still there. The covered area was originally much larger. There is an opening of about facing north. At the front, the cave has a height of about . From the middle of the cave, it gets lower. At the back, the height is about less. 
In 2013, a fence was built on the space in front of the case. In 2016, video surveillance was installed.
History.
When he found traces Bronze Age settlements there in 1960, Gaston Etienne (1923-2010) recognized that the case was important for archaeology. Etienne was a councillor in Malaverne. Since 1993, there have been excavations each year. Since 2006, Ludovic Slimak - a research associate from the University of Toulouse and the CNRS is overseeing these excavations. There are twelve cultural layers at the site, In 2014, seven layers had been excavated. The layers date from 42.000 BP (called early Aurigacien) to 56,000 BP (La Quina-Mousterian).
The oldest known evidence of anatomically-modern humans (homo sapiens) in Europe was found in the Batcho Kiro Cave in Bulgaria. This evidence is 45,820 to 43,650 years (Cal BP) old. In February 2022, it was announced that part of a tooth was found at the Mandrin Cave. It came from a layer of the Mandrin Cave under and over which Neanderthal remains have been recovered, but this "baby tooth" has been attributed to a child of Homo sapiens. Articles in the Journals Science, as well as in Nature, said that the tooth was too badly damaged to be able to tell with certainty if it was from a Neanderthal, or a human. 

An eyeliner (sometimes written eye liner) is a type of makeup used for the eyes. It is applied around the contours of the eyes to create different aesthetic effects.
In the 20th and 21st century, the use of eye liner has also been associated with Goth and Punk fashion.
History.
Eye liner was first used in Ancient India, Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia as a dark black line around the eyes. As early as 10,000 BC, Egyptians and Mesopotamians wore various cosmetics including eye liner not only for aesthetics but to protect the skin from the desert sun. Eye liner may also have been worn to protect the wearer from the evil eye. The characteristic of having heavily lined eyes has been frequently shown in ancient Egyptian art. They produced eye liner with a variety of materials, including copper ore and antimony. Ancient Egyptian kohl contained galena, which was imported from nearby regions in the Land of Punt, Coptos and Western Asia.
In the 1960s, liquid eye liner was used to create thick black and white lines around the eyes in the make-up fashion associated with designers like Mary Quant. The '60s and '70s also saw new fashion trends which made use of eyeliner, eyeshadow and mascara in new ways. As goth and punk fashion developed, they employed eyeliner for a dark and dramatic effect.

The voiceless alveolar trill differs from the voiced alveolar trill in its phonation (whether or not the vocal chords are vibrating while pronouncing the sound). It is used in a few languages. In languages that also have the voiced alveolar trill, it can be a similar sound or an allophone (another way a certain sound can be pronounced).
In Proto-Indo-European, the sound *sr became a sound spelled , with the letter for and the diacritic for , in Ancient Greek. This sound was probably a voiceless alveolar trill. It became the regular word-initial (meaning "at the start of a word") allophone of in standard Attic Greek. This sound has disappeared in Modern Greek.

The financial model for a start-up is an exercise in creativity and forward-thinking. It’s an opportunity for entrepreneurs to let their imagination run wild, finally voicing their visions on paper. As startups are generally risky investments, the financial model is a tool that helps investors evaluate the venture before committing funds. The main purpose of the startup financial model is to show investors that your company can reach profitability within a reasonable time frame and make them enough money to justify their investment.
Importance.
Financial modeling is an integral part of the startup world. You can use models to predict future growth, understand the impact of certain decisions, and help raise funding. It's also a great tool to see how sensitive your business is to certain assumptions. You can change certain inputs to see how they affect your bottom line or different stages in your model. Models are also good tools for learning about new industries and understanding valuations (if you're looking at acquiring another business).
Types.
Financial models are mathematical representations of a financial situation. They can range from simple to complex, depending on the purpose and users of the model. Different model types are appropriate for different purposes, such as long-term strategic planning or annual budgeting.
A company may use several different types of models at the same time. For example, a company may have a long-term strategic plan that it uses to inform its capital investment decisions, but it will also create an annual budget model to plan out how much cash it expects to spend and earn over the course of the year.
Financial modeling for startups.
Financial modelling for startups is the creation of a financial representation of a startup business. It's used to forecast future cash flows and profitability.
Financial modelling is often used to assess a company's current financial health, its valuation and its potential for future growth. Financial modeling for startups is often used to prepare a document known as a pitch deck. This document is presented to investors and contains information such as: the company's business model, its target market, how it will make money, founders' backgrounds and its revenue projections.
A financial model is not complete without a full set of business assumptions that make up the model. These assumptions are typically broken down by revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), operating expenses, depreciation and amortization (D&amp;A) and capital expenditures (CAPEX). The process of building a startup financial model is usually referred to as financial modeling.

The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) was a United States federal agency. It was founded on March 3, 1915. The agency researched flight technology and aircraft. On October 1, 1958, the agency was dissolved. Its employees were moved to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Founding.
NACA was founded on March 3, 1915. At that time, technology and culture were changing quickly. American flight technology was not as advanced as Europe's. The American public had mixed feelings about flight technology. Some people thought that flying was dangerous and foolish. Some thought that it was an important achievement in technology. But in Europe, people were more confident in flight technology. 
When World War I started in Europe, the Europeans were already using advanced flight technology. The Germans used airships to bomb British cities. Airplanes were used to spy on enemies. This worried the Americans, who realized that their flight technology is behind Europe's. In response, the federal government of the United States created NACA on March 3, 1915.
Research.
By the 1920s, the NACA's mission was to promote military and civilian flight. The NACA did this by researching new flight technologies. To help this research, the NACA built many testing facilities. This included wind tunnels, test stands, and flight test facilities. The agency received a budget of $5000 in 1915. 
World War II.
The NACA was involved in World War II. They helped research many flight technologies. A lot of the research that the NACA did before World War II was used to make American fighter planes fly better. They researched how to reduce drag. Drag slows down airplanes when moving in the air. They also researched how to stop the propellers of the plane from freezing. 
NASA.
On November 21, 1957, Hugh Dryden, NACA's director, established the Special Committee on Space Technology. This committee was created to help develop a space program.

The Yucatán shovel-headed tree frog, Yucatan casque-headed tree frog, or Yucatan casquehead tree frog ("Triprion petasatus") is a frog that lives in Mexico and Guatemala. Scientists also saw it just once in Honduras.
Name.
This frog's Latin "petasatus" means "with a hat on." The Latin and English names come from the frog's big head, which looks like a hat or helmet.
Appearance.
The adult male frog is 48.1 to 60.8 mm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 65.0 to 75.2 mm long. It is named after its large, bony head, which looks like a hat or helmet. The adult male frog is olive green. The adult female frog is light brown or green-brown. There are dark brown or black marks on the back and legs. Some frogs have silver marks on their backs and head. The frogs have yellow color on their sides or red brown on their back legs. The belly is white and tan.
Actions.
This frog lays eggs when the weather is rainy. The male frog climbs to a branch about 2.5 meters over the ground and sings for the female. The male and female mate in trees or other high places. The female lays eggs in shallow water. When the weather is dry or the sun is hot, this frog goes to a hole in a tree. It puts its body inside and its head against the hole.
Threats.
This frog is not in danger of dying out. This is because human beings change the places where the frog lives. Human beings cut down the forests for wood, farms, towns, and places for animals to eat grass.
Relationship to humans.
Human beings catch and breed this frog to sell as pets.

Highly abundant numbers are a type of natural number. Any natural number "n" is called highly abundant when a certain equation is true.
formula_1
In this equation, "m" is every integer less than "n". "�" is the sum of every positive divisor of that number.
Example.
An example would be to use the number 5. "�" of 5 is 5 + 1 = 6. Every "�" less than 5, however, is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. 7 is greater than 6. This makes 5 not a highly abundant number.
History.
Highly abundant numbers were first learned about by Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai in 1943. Work on the subject was done by Paul Erdős and Leonidas Alaoglu in 1944. Alaoglu and Erdős discovered every highly abundant number up to 104. They also showed that the number of highly abundant numbers less than "N" is proportional to log2 "N".
The first few highly abundant numbers are
There are only two odd highly abundant numbers. They are 1 and 3.
Similarities with other numbers.
The first eight factorials are highly abundant. However, not all factorials are highly abundant. For example,
but there is a smaller number with larger sum of divisors,
This makes 9! is not highly abundant.
Alaoglu and Erdős discovered that all superabundant numbers are also highly abundant. There are, however, an infinite number of highly abundant numbers that are not superabundant numbers. This was proven by Jean-Louis Nicolas in 1969.
7200 is the largest powerful number that is also highly abundant. This is because every highly abundant number that is larger has a prime factor that divides them only once.

He was a native Acehnese who was born to a father who were an Aceh's "uleebalang" ( in Acehnese). His front name "Teuku" indicated that he was originally from notable Acehnese family background.
Early life.
In 1947, a day after Queen Juliana appointed as regent, the 18-year-old Teuku Iskandar was able to continue his study at Leiden University in Leiden (part of the Netherlands).
In 1955, he earned his doctorate from Leiden University with a dissertation which was later published as a book, "De Hikajat Atjeh" (). Topics related to Aceh has become his personal interest due to his personal ancestry background, which later also became his main topic of his dissertation. His interest was mainly driven by his personal background because at that time he was part of the first-known generation of Acehnese who studied at the Leiden University in Netherlands. Moreover, at that time he was motivated by the fact that there were not as many books written by native Indonesians that discuss about the state of Aceh and its natives (the Acehnese people and Acehnese language). In addition, Teuku Iskandar adore the Acehnese culture so much, as he told to his children.
1960s.
In the 1960s, Teuku Iskandar asked by Sukarno (the first president of Indonesia) to be part of the founders of a state university in the state of Aceh, which later publicly known as the Syiah Kuala University, which he was briefly served as the dean for the Faculty of Economics for several years.
His diligence in studying the Malay literature as one of the indigenous languages of Sumatra (and also the native culture of Sumatra in general) attracted another countries interest, such as the federation of Malaysia who had no capable linguists or even scholars at that time (as Malaysia was developed as newly created country), he was offered to work at the "Dewan Pustaka dan Bahasa" () of Malaysia. During his tenure, Teuku Iskandar asked by the Malaysia's linguistic council to copied the "Bahasa Indonesia dan Pembakuannya" () and "Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia" () who were developed by Raja Ali Haji (an Indonesian Bugis scholar) since 19th century and Anton Moeliono in 1969 to re-branded and claimed it as the "Kamus Dewan" () that published in 1970 and designated as the main linguistic reference for the Malay language in the region (which later also known as Malaysian Malay). At the same time, he was also asked by the Sultan of Brunei Darussalam to become a lecture at the University of Brunei Darussalam and he received a professorship from the university. His works are still used as the main linguistic source for the Standard Malay until nowadays in all respective Malay-speaking countries (which may include Singapore).
Teuku Iskandar later returned to Leiden to serve as the lecturer. Within his alma-mater (Leiden University) educational environment, he became a prominent and ultimate professor for Acehnese and Malay literature, and also gave special classes in the Acehnese language. As an Acehnese enthusiast, he also continued to produce his works related to Aceh including "the Catalog of Acehnese Manuscripts" (compiled with Voorhoeve), two large volumes of "the Catalog of Malay, Minangkabau and South Sumatra, and Manuscripts" (in the Netherlands).
Family relationship.
Studying classical literary manuscripts is a job that not many people can do. It takes passion, perseverance, thoroughness and high concentration. But, indeed, such qualities seem to be attached to Teuku Iskandar. "Dad really likes history and art", said Tjut Njak Ubit Iskandar who are the second daughter of Teuku Iskandar. Teuku Iskandar is very thorough even in reading the books he referenced.
As a close daughter, Tjut Njak Ubit Iskandar often found his father's handwritten notes in reference books, which indicated that the information in the books could be referenced or questioned. Ubit also said that his father is the type of person who reads and contemplates a lot. Despite his abundant knowledge, he is not an 'outsider' or talkative person. Not all of his interlocutors can also make him interested in talking. But if he meets someone he thinks is sharp-minded, this father of three will be an extraordinary storyteller. “When there is a moment like that, my mother usually asks me to bring a recording device to save the interesting conversation,” recalls Ubit.
Teuku Iskandar was also a scholar and person who holds principles. He's not the kind of person who wants to please others but rather be himself. In Ubit's eyes, his father was not interested in politics even though he loved Sumatran (especially Acehnese and Malay) culture very much, he was an intellectual who carried himself as a citizen of the world. Also, not many people know that Teuku Iskandar is very fond of architectural history. According to Ubit, it can be said that his father's first love was precisely in architecture. However, because his chemistry skills were not sufficient to become a scholar of architecture, he then chose to study literature.
Teuku Iskandar's passion for architecture can be found in his residence in Jakarta which he designed himself. He also built a rest house with an English garden-style garden in Bogor, which he also designed his own architecture. At his home in the Netherlands, Teuku Iskandar designed a fireplace made of wood from a bridge from the 17th century with Acehnese decorations. One of his other hobbies is sketching. Teuku also once conveyed his dream to his sons and daughters, he wanted to build a farmhouse in Aceh. "I have a dream (to develop) in Aceh", Ubit remembers his father.
In one of his works, a book that discusses "Bustanas-Salatin" by Nuruddin ar-Ranniry, Teuku Iskandar asked Ubit to translate it into English. For years, the father and daughter studied books by 17th century clerics who were read by scholars and sultans in the Aceh Kingdom. For Ubit, it was a wonderful experience that was unforgettable.
As a respected scholar (mainly in Indonesia and Southeast Asia), Teuku Iskandar was known as a very down-to-earth person. Tjut Rosmanida, his first daughter who lived in Medan, said, “Father is a humble and simple person. His demeanor is mediocre. When you go home to Aceh, you always ask for Acehnese food to be cooked. He likes all Acehnese dishes.” A valuable lesson from his father that he always reminded him to be proud to be an Acehnese and proud to speak the Acehnese language.
Awards.
Teuku Iskandar was officially awarded in 2017 as the ‘"Satyalancana Budaya"’, an award by the national government of the Republic Indonesia due to his revolutionary and persistent works, especially in revivifying the indigenous Sumatran linguistics and cultures (mainly revolve about Acehnese, as well as Malay).

Kao (/káo/) is a legendary bull captured by Khuman Khamba in Meitei mythology and folklore of Ancient Moirang. It appears in the legend of "Kao Phaba" (), also known as "Khambana Kao Phaba" () of the Khamba Thoibi epic.
Etymology.
In Meitei (Manipuri), the word "Kao" has many meanings. It may mean (1) to forget, (2) a sacrifice bull or (3) to kick. Here, it means bull. As a noun, it means a stray bull that roams freely instead of living on a ranch or farm. In verbal form, it means to offer a bull as a living sacrifice to God. People also say "Kaoren" or "Kaorel" to talk about the bull. "Kaoren" is made up of two parts, "Kao" and "-ren". "-ren" refers to excellence. So, "Kaoren" or "Kaorel" means "an extraordinary bull", "a powerful bull", "a super bull" or "a supernatural bull".
Mythology.
The false oracle.
Once Angom Nongban Kongyamba met fisher women from the Khuman kingdom in a place called Moirang. Both the Khuman kingdom and the Moirang kingdom were on the shores of the Loktak lake.
The women came to Moirang besides having their own fishing area. So, Kongyamba asked them the reason for coming to Moirang. 
The women said that a dangerous bull had killed many people near the water, so they could not fish:
&lt;poem&gt;"There is a great bull that lurks among the reeds of the shores of the lake, and it had claimed life of many. So, we dare not to fish there."&lt;/poem&gt; 
Suddenly, an idea came to Kongyamba's mind. He went to the king. He acted as a person possessed by a divine spirit. Kongyamba told the King,
&lt;poem&gt;"God Thangjing had spoken in my ears and I have his behest upon me. Verily said the God, I am sated with offerings of flesh and fish, but this year, my heart longs for the sweet savour of the flesh of the mighty bull that lurks in the reeds that border the water of the lake. My servant Khamba vows that he will bring it for my honor and for the welfare of the State."&lt;/poem&gt;
The king called and asked Khamba about his promise. Khamba denied it. There resulted a great conflict between Khamba and Kongyamba. Later, Khamba told the king he would catch the bull if it was the God’s will. 
The king was happy with Khamba. So, he promised him he could marry Princess Thoibi if he did catch the bull. Minister Thonglen put seven marks on the lintel post of the capital city. It was the record of the King's promise.
Embassy to Khuman kingdom.
The king of Moirang sent an embassy to the king of Khuman. The embassy proposed to organize the great sport of capturing the wild bull. The Khuman king agreed. A grand Colosseum was built for the event. The Colosseum could hold a capacity of the audiences from both the two kingdoms.
Capture by Khamba.
Khamnu revealed a secret to Khamba. She said that the bull had once belonged to their father. She told him that if Khamba told the bull their father's name, it would be tame and gentle:
&lt;poem&gt;"This great bull was once the Lord of your father's herd. Go to him, speak your father's name in his ear, and show him this Rope of silk."&lt;/poem&gt;
On the day of the adventure, Khamba stood face to face with the bull. The bull ran towards him with its dangerous horns. Khamba bent a little to the side. The people watching asked him if he was afraid. Khamba answered that he was waiting for a good position. Then, he stood on firm ground and caught the bull. The strong bull carried him away into the thick woods.
Khamba did everything as his sister had told him to do. Immediately, the wild bull became tame and gentle. Khamba brought the bull back.
On the way back, Kongyamba came to him before anyone saw them. Kongyamba pretended to help Khamba to hold the bull. Kongyamba held the rope. When everyone saw, Kongyamba claimed that he had captured the bull. He added that he even rescued Khamba who had fallen into the ditch. Once again, there was a great conflict between Khamba and Kongyamba over the claim. The two kings could not find out who was right. So, Kongyamba was asked to fight the bull within an enclosure. But Kongyamba was afraid of the bull. He climbed up on the heights to save himself. Khamba faced the bull bravely. He once again captured the bull.

Jan Dismas Zelenka (16 October 1679 – 23 December 1745) was a Bohemian baroque composer.
Life.
Zelenka was born in Louňovice pod Blaníkem, Bohemia. It is a small market town southeast of Prague. He was baptized as Jan Lukas Zelenka. His first music teacher was likely his father, Jiři. His father was an organist and organist in Louňovice. He received more musical training at the Jesuit college Clementinum in Prague. He learned to play the violone (a kind of contrabass in the Baroque period). 
Education.
In 1709, he studied with Johann Hubert Hartig in Prague. Zelenka had access to a lot of Italian baroque music through his teacher's library.
Move to Dresden.
Zelenka moved to Dresden in 1710 or 1711. He became the violone player in the Dresden court orchestra. He received a salary of 300 thalers when he started working in Dresden. He must have been a very impressive musician. His salary was increased to 400 thalers in 1714. He wrote his Mass, the "Missa Sanctae Caeciliae" (St. Cecilia Mass) in 1711.
Visit to Vienna.
In 1716, Zelenka visited Vienna to study with Johann Joseph Fux. Fux was the Imperial in Vienna. That means Fux was in charget of the music for the Holy Roman Emperor. It is unclear if he also visited Venice during this time.
Return to Dresden.
Zelenka returned to Dresden in 1719. He visited Prague from 1722 - 23. He wrote some of his instrumental works while in Prague.
The "Kapellmeister" in Dresden at that time was Johann David Heinichen. Because Heinichen was often ill, Zelenka managed the sacred music in Dresden. When Heinichen died in 1729, Zelenka became an acting "Kapellmeister". He finally became a "Kapellmeister" in 1734. In 1726, Zelenka started a list of works composed by the composers in Dresden. This list is called the "Inventarium". It is an important document for Dresden baroque music. 
In the 1730s, a group of Italian-trained singers arrived at Dresden. They were prepared to resurrect opera in Dresden. Zelenka's job was to train these singers. He wrote some arias for the singers to practice. After August II, Zelenka's employer died, Zelenka asked the new King August III for the title of "Kapellmeister". This title was granted to Zelenka on 1734. Johann Sebastian Bach also received the title of "Royal Polish Composer" in 1736. 
Death.
On 23 December 1745, Zelenka died of dropsy. Because he was a Catholic, he was allowed to be buried in the Catholic cemetery. According to the records in Dresden, Zelenka never married. He lived alone. His music became valuable after he died. Georg Philipp Telemann tried to publish Zelenka's works. He was not successful. The manuscripts of Zelenka's music remained locked in Dresden. There are no known paintings of Zelenka.
Music.
Zelenka's musical style is very unique. He used unexpected harmonies and rhythms. His musical writing shows that he mastered counterpoint. Zelenka may have used elements from Bohemian folk music in his music. He was respected by Bach. Bach performed some of Zelenka's music in Leipzig, where Bach worked.

In math, a colossally abundant number (also written as CA) is a type of natural number that has to follow a special set of rules. CAs usually have a lot of divisors. To figure out whether or not a number is a CA, however, it has to follow an equation. For a number to be colossally abundant, � has to be greater than 0. "k" a number greater than 1 and � is the sum of every divisor that the number has.
All colossally abundant numbers are also superabundant numbers, but not all superabundant numbers are colossal.
The first 15 colossally abundant numbers are 2, 6, 12, 60, 120, 360, 2520, 5040, 55440, 720720, 1441440, 4324320, 21621600, 367567200, 6983776800 . These are also the first 15 superior highly composite numbers.
History.
Colossally abundant numbers were first learned about by Ramanujan. They were written about in his paper about highly composite numbersin 1915.
In 1944, Leonidas Alaoglu and Paul Erdős expanded on what Ramanujan's wrote about and learned more about it.
Similarities with the Riemann hypothesis.
In the 1980s, Guy Robin showed that the Riemann hypothesis is the same for whenever "n" is greater than 5040(� is the Euler–Mascheroni constant).
This doesn't work for 27 different numbers :
Robin showed that if the Riemann hypothesis is true then "n" = 5040 is the last integer that doesn't work in this equation. This inequality is also known as Robin's inequality.
From 2001–2002 Lagarias showed that Robin's inequality can be written another way. This inequality uses the harmonic numbers instead of logarithms and works for any CA that is bigger than 60.
The next inequality works for when "n" is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 24 or 60.

Hadesarchaea are very small living things. They are thermophile Archaea that live in very hot places underground. People have found them in sand at the bottom of the ocean, deep mines, hot springs, and other places underground.
Name.
Hadesarchaea were first called the South-African Gold Mine Miscellaneous Euryarchaeal Group (SAGMEG) because they were found in a gold mine in South Africa. They were renamed "Hadesarchaea" in 2016 (Hades was the Greek god who ruled the land of the dead).
Genome.
In 2016, scientists used a method called shotgun sequencing to make a model of the Hadesarchaea genome. A genome is all the genes in an living thing and the other pieces of DNA and RNA that help them work. The Hadesarchaea genome is about 1.5 Megabase pairs in size, which is about 0.5 Mbp smaller than most other Archaea. The scientists think the small genome is how the Hadesarchaea can stay alive with only a little to eat.
Scientists believe Hadesarchaea came from an ancestor that used methane as food.
Ecology.
The first Hadesarchaea that people found were in a mine in South Africa about 3 km (2 mi) under the surface of the Earth. They do not need oxygen or light to live. They were later also found in the White Oak River estuary in North Carolina, a place where a river meets the ocean, and in Yellowstone National Park's Lower Culex Basin. These areas are hot, 70 °C (158 °F), and are so alkaline that they would destroy most living things. Other scientists looked through the soil near old mines in East Harz, Germany and think they may have found pieces of 16S rRNA that could be from Hadesarchaea or their close relatives.
Hadesarchaea are the only archaea that can turn carbon monoxide and water into carbon dioxide and oxygen. When they do this, the reaction gives off hydrogen. Scientists looked at more information about the Hadesarchaea genome and believe they have genes that let them put carbon atoms into other molecules and make methane. Other scientists think Hadesarchaea may be able to use sugar and amino acids as fuel and change nitrite into ammonium. Scientists think Hadesarchaea help in geochemical processes.

Macadam is a type of road making. It was invented by the Scottish engineer John Loudon McAdam, about 1820. 
He put crushed stone in shallow, convex layers and compacted thoroughly (squashed it down). Sometimes a layer of stone dust was covered with a cement or bitumin. This keeps the dust and stones together.
Macadam's ideas were built on the ideas of some earlier road engineers, like Trésaguet and Thomas Telford.
The Romans had not used a binding substance like bitumen. Their roads were nevertheless quite long-lasting.

"Hello Again" is a song performed by the rock band The Cars. It was released on the 1984 album "Heartbeat City". It was the album's fourth Top 20 hit, reaching number 20 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart; it also reached number 8 on the Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart and number 22 on the Mainstream Rock chart.
Music video.
The song's music video was directed by Andy Warhol, who also appeared in the video as did a then-unknown Gina Gershon. Keyboardist Greg Hawkes said "I think [Warhol] mainly did some of the conceptualizing and showed up to be an extra. And he invited his various friends to be in it. It was like any video shoot, but with a more interesting cast of characters. And you could always look over on the set and go 'Hey that's Andy Warhol.'"
The music video explored the controversial issues of sex and violence (mostly the former) being featured in music and at the time.
Reception.
"Hello Again" was described as "eccentric" by AllMusic critic Greg Prato, who also cited the track as a highlight from the "Heartbeat City" album. Donald Guarisco, also of AllMusic, said, "One of their strongest tracks [on "Heartbeat City" with experimental roots] was 'Hello Again,' a stylish new wave rocker with plenty of experimental touches." Guarisco also said it "is a song that represents the Cars striking a unique balance between their gift for pop hooks and their love of experimental sounds."
In his review of the "Greatest Hits" compilation album, Greg Prato felt that "Hello Again" should have appeared, stating "why was the title track from "Heartbeat City" (an unsuccessful single) included instead of the 1984 Top 20 hit 'Hello Again'?"

"Tonight She Comes" is a 1985 song by The Cars, from their "Greatest Hits" album. It was released as a single in October 1985, reaching number 7 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. It also reached number 1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, where it stayed for three weeks. It was The Cars' fourth and (as of 2010) last Top 40 hit.
Composition.
It is a simple, diatonic pop rock song in F major, featuring a hard rock-style guitar solo by Cars guitarist Elliot Easton.
The solo was transcribed by Steve Vai in the February 1986 issue of "Guitar Player" magazine, as the centrepiece of an interview with Easton. In the interview, Easton described the custom-built Kramer guitar used for the solo, saying that the reason the solo was "so dense" was due to the four weeks he spent recording the single, giving Easton long enough to compose it.
The song's title is another Ric Ocasek double entendre, though, as Elliot Easton put it, "it doesn't actually say that she reaches orgasm. It could mean that tonight she's coming over to make popcorn."
Release and reception.
"Tonight She Comes" was The Cars' fourth Top 10 hit. It was the first of two songs to be released as a single from their "Greatest Hits" album; a remixed version of "I'm Not the One", previously recorded in 1981 for the "Shake It Up" album, was the second.
AllMusic critic Greg Prato, in his review for "Greatest Hits" described the track as "playful", while Tim Sendra, also from AllMusic, said in his review of "The Essentials" that the song (among the others on that album), was "definitely essential". Critic Donald Guarisco said that the song "is one of their most straightforward pop outings and shows just how far they had moved from the acidic mindset of 'Just What I Needed' and "Let's Go. He went on to say that the track was "a delightful, pristine pop confection".

"Coming Up You" is a 1987 song by The Cars, appearing on their sixth studio album "Door to Door". It was written by Ric Ocasek and sung by Benjamin Orr.
Release.
"Coming Up You" was first released as the eighth track on "Door to Door" in August 1987. The song later saw a single release in the US and Australia, backed by the "Door to Door" track "Double Trouble." The third single from "Door to Door" (after the top twenty hit "You Are the Girl" and its less successful follow-up "Strap Me In,"), the song peaked at number 74 on the Billboard Hot 100 (a slight improvement from the performance of "Strap Me In") and number 37 on the Adult Contemporary Chart. Unlike its predecessors, however, it failed to chart at all on the Mainstream Rock chart.
The single was the last Cars single released before the band broke up in 1988 (although it was followed by "Sad Song" when the band reunited in 2011.)
Reception.
"AllMusic" critic Mike DeGagne called the track the "most melodious tune [on "Door to Door"]" and went on to say it "was easily one of The Cars most distinct efforts since it doesn’t quite carry the same new wave/pop rock structure as the rest of their material yet relinquishes the same type of Cars charm." DeGagne continued, "'Coming Up You' is one of [the] bright spots in an otherwise faltering release as fans were still comparing "Door To Door" to the success of 1984's "Heartbeat City" album. After all of the tracks are heard on "Door To Door", 'Coming Up You' easily rises above the rest of the album’s lackluster fair, mainly because [Ben] Orr seems to sound more enthused and more interested than [Ric] Ocasek does on any of his songs."

"Sad Song" is the lead single by the American rock band The Cars from their 2011 studio album "Move Like This". A short clip of the song was released in December 2010; the full song was released to radio on March 1, 2011.
Details.
"Exclaim!" magazine comments on the song saying "[d]espite the title and lyrics, it doesn't sound particularly sad, as it contains a cheery beat and a catchy mix of synths and guitars". Critics have noted the similarity of "Sad Song" to the band's previous singles, such as 1978's "My Best Friend's Girl" and 1979's "Let's Go".
"Sad Song" peaked at number 25 on the Billboard Rock Charts.

Priority Records is a United States-based record label, owned and operated by EMI, and has made a name for itself primarily in hip hop music. Priority has also provided distribution for other labels such as Ruthless Records, Death Row Records, No Limit Records, and Roc-A-Fella Records.
Company history.
Beginnings.
The Los Angeles-based company was formed in 1985 by three former K-tel executives: Bryan Turner, Mark Cerami and Steve Drath. Seed funding was provided by R-tek, a company headed by former K-tel board members: Ray and Harold Kives, and their company acquired an initial 50% stake in Priority. Priority bought out R-tek's interest in 1987.
To support early operations, Priority licensed others' repertoire and released compilation albums, but soon began developing its own roster of major artists. Priority was able to achieve unparalleled success as an independent label by developing an underground "street-based" marketing formula that set precedents and bypassed mainstream radio. His unique approach allowed Priority to sell millions of records without getting into the fiercely competitive battles of the major record labels for airplay. Priority's strategic marketing team was developed by Vice President Alyssa Pisano, who led Priority's Marketing and Creative Services Department from 1987 to 1996. Priority's roster featured numerous gold, platinum, and multi-platinum artists, including N.W.A, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Master P, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, Mack 10, Westside Connection, Eazy-E and Ice T.
EMI acquisition.
In the early 1990s, the label entered into a distribution deal with EMI, while continuing to operate independently. EMI bought a 50% stake in Priority in 1996 and the remainder in 1998. Despite EMI's full ownership, Priority remained an independently managed company until 2001, when its operations were merged with EMI's main US subsidiary, Capitol Records. Priority was absorbed into Capitol Records in 2004 and ceased operations.
Revival.
In late 2006, EMI revived Priority Records. The first act signed to the newly reorganized company is C-Murder (who, in the mid-late 1990s, recorded for the label through No Limit Records.)

Living Things is the fifth studio album by American rock band Linkin Park, released through Warner Bros. Records on 26 June 2012. The album was produced by Mike Shinoda and Rick Rubin, and presented a new direction in Linkin Park's music, combining the hard rock sounds of their debut album, "Hybrid Theory" and the electronic mixes of their very successful previous studio album, "A Thousand Suns", whilst keeping a brand new, original sound.
Background and recording.
In June 2011, Bennington revealed to "Kerrang!" that Linkin Park has started working on new material for their next album. He explained, "We've been working on a new record for the past two months. The music is great and we're well ahead of where we're expecting to be. There aren't a whole lot of noises going on, but there are a lot of good songs."
Rick Rubin produced the album. "Typically we'll have a once-a-week meeting to go listen to the songs that they're coming up with and talk about them. For so early in the project, they are much further along than they have been on the last two albums we did. On "A Thousand Suns" there were still a lot of irons in the fire. We knew, 'OK, we can't do this forever. Let's leave this batch and we'll come back and address it when we start up again, Rubin said.
In July 2011, Bennington told "Rolling Stone" that Linkin Park aimed to produce a new album every eighteen months, and that he would be shocked if a new album did not come out in 2012. The band continued to record and produce new material even while on tour. Bennington commented on Linkin Park's schedule, stating, "Touring for two years is excruciating. When we would tour for two years even the most resilient person in the band, at the end of that, was fucking miserable." He further elaborated on their ideas in an interview with MTV saying, "We do have a really great head start. We've got some great music, some good ideas. The creativity has continued to flow for us for the last few years, consistently." He later revealed in another interview in September 2011 that the band was still in the beginning phases of the next album, saying "We just kind of began. We like to keep the creative juices flowing, so we try to keep that going all the time...we like the direction that we're going in."

Vanguard Records is a record label founded in 1950 by brothers Maynard and Seymour Solomon in New York. It started as a classical music label, but is perhaps best known for its catalogue of recordings by several seminal folk and blues artists from the 1960s; Bach Guild was a subsidiary label.
History.
In 1953, under the direction of John Hammond, the company began the "Jazz Showcase" series concentrating on the idiom of mainstream jazz, producing around two dozen recordings before it closed about 1958. The recordings made at the Spirituals to Swing concerts in 1938 and 1939 were finally released by Vanguard in 1959. Thereafter the company only continued to record Jazz and Blues on and off. 
Vanguard branched out in the mid-1950s by defying the blacklist and signing blacklisted artist Paul Robeson and The Weavers. The company continued to issue folk music with newly signed artists including Joan Baez, Hedy West, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Country Joe and the Fish, Ian and Sylvia, Mimi and Richard Fariña. 
In the summer of 1965, Maynard Solomon hired Samuel Charters to edit the 1964 Newport Folk Festival tapes. Following that project, the company sent Charters to Chicago to tape the wide range of blues musicians there. Those sessions resulted in the classic 1966 three-album series titled "Chicago/The Blues/Today!", which introduced a new generation to the blues. The albums included sets by Junior Wells with Buddy Guy, Muddy Water's bandmates Otis Spann and James Cotton, Otis Rush, Homesick James, Johnny Shines, Big Walter Horton, and Charlie Musselwhite.
Vanguard released a series of important classical recordings, both domestically produced and imported. Many of the latter came from the British label Pye Records label, with performances by the Halle Orchestra conducted by Sir John Barbirolli. The recordings were so exceptional in their stereo sound and overall quality that many classical radio stations played them. Vanguard even released some classical quadraphonic recordings in the early 1970s, including a performance of Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony with the American Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The label also released many performances by the Utah Symphony Orchestra conducted by Maurice Abravanel, as well as the earlier P.D.Q. Bach recordings, from 1965 to 1983. Vanguard was the first US label to issue the complete 1944 hi-fi recordings of composer Richard Strauss conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra in most of his symphonic poems; the recordings were made on the Magnetophon tape recording equipment in the Vienna Opera House.
In the early 1970s, Indian classical musician and sarod virtouso Vasant Rai was signed exclusively by Vanguard. Vanguard put out 5 hit albums of Vasant Rai. That time, Vanguard released albums by Michigan-based rock groups such as Dick Wagner and The Frost and was inspired by a novelty hit they released, Benny Bell's "Shaving Cream" to release albums of humorous music inspired by Dr. Demento. Tom Paxton recorded two albums, "New Songs from the Briarpatch" and "Heroes", on Vanguard Records in the late 1970s.
The label lay dormant for most of the mid-to-late 1970s, briefly resurfacing with a few disco releases in the 1980s, and was finally sold to the Welk Music Group in 1985. The Welk Group sold the classical music catalogue back to Seymour Solomon. Welk Music Group revitalized the label, reissuing much of its extensive catalogue of folk and popular music (much of which had been out of print for several years) on CD, as well as signing several new artists (such as Mindy Smith), along with established artists (such as Edwin McCain, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, Blues Traveler, Shawn Mullins, Chely Wright and more). 
Vanguard Classics.
Vanguard Classics was sold after Seymour Solomon's death to Artemis Records, which reactivated the company with new releases from Leon Fleisher and Gil Shaham. When Artemis closed in 2004, the Vanguard Classics catalogue was sold to Sheridan Square Entertainment, which licenses Vanguard Classics material with no apparent plans to relaunch or reactivate the label.

Chart performance.
"Break It Off" was released as a digital download on online stores, including the U.S. iTunes Store on February 19, 2007 and peaked at number 2. It debuted at number eight on the US Hot Digital Songs chart, selling 75,316 downloads.

In Latin America, the song barely managed to crack the Peru Top 100 at number ninety-two.

E. Kidd Bogart (born January 23, 1978 in Los Angeles, California) is a multi-faceted American music executive and songwriter who has contributed to a long list of internationally successful artists. He is the son of Casablanca Records founder Neil Bogart and music manager Joyce Bogart-Trabulus, who managed KISS and Donna Summer. 
Music career.
From a very young age he wanted to carry on the family tradition and began working at Interscope Records as an intern when he was 16 years old. Former Interscope Records president Tom Whalley took a chance on him when Bogart turned 18 and promoted him into the A&amp;R department. Under Whalley's supervision, Bogart helped coordinate of various projects, most notably for 2Pac as a project coordinator and hip-hop icon Eminem as an A&amp;R. It was also widely reported that Bogart was responsible for finding and bringing Eminem into Interscope Records. 
By the age of 21, Bogart had transitioned into management while working as an A&amp;R consultant for Warner Bros. Records. In his managerial career, he formed the now-defunct BAT Management with partners Walter "Walt Liquor" Taylor and Jordan Feldstein. Under BAT Management and along with other managers Joseph "3H" Weinberger, Justin Trugman and Todd Bird, he was responsible for and/or assisted in the careers of Grammy Award winning Maroon 5 (then known as Kara's Flowers), Planet Asia, Mystic, Styles of Beyond and various other artists. Bogart played an integral role in Maroon 5 signing with Octone Records with Feldstein, who still manages the band.
In 2002, Bogart founded Casbah Artists Management with his then-wife Cheryl Costanzo (now divorced), in tribute to his late father. Under Casbah, Bogart managed former Dreamworks recording artist Vishiss. During the making of the record, Bogart met future collaborator J. R. Rotem, a producer on the record.
In the summer of 2004, Bogart began working for the Agency for the Performing Arts as an Agent in the Concerts Department. In 2006, Bogart's APA roster included OneRepublic, The Outline, DJ Graham Funke, DJ Stonerokk and Planet Asia, among others. 
While working at the agency, Bogart, inspired by Costanzo to do so, developed an all-female R&amp;B trio called Raw Candy.

The hourglass tree frog ("Dendropsophus ebraccatus") is a frog that lives in Mexico, Colombia, Belize and Nicaragua. Scientists have seen it as high as 1600 meters above sea level.
The adult male frog is 23.63 to 26.75 mm long from nose to rear end and the largest adult female frogs are 36.5 mm long. Frogs that live high up in the hills are larger than frogs that live low and close to the ocean. This frog's head is wider than its body. It has yellow skin and a brown pattern on its back that look like an hourglass. 
Male frogs sing for females after it rains. The rain creates pools of water that are not there during the dry season. The males sit on plants high above the pools and sing so the females will come to them. There are also "sneaker males" who sit between the pools and the singing males so the females will meet them first.
The females lay 180 to 300 eggs at a time. Most frogs can lay eggs either on land or in water but not both. However, the hourglass tree frog can lay eggs on both. If the pool is in the sun, the female frog will lay her eggs on a piece of plant under the surface of the water so that they don't dry out. If the pool is in the shade, she will lay her eggs near the water so that the tadpoles fall into it after they hatch. For example, she may lay her eggs on a leaf on a branch hanging over the water. If she lays eggs in the water, fish might eat them. If she lays eggs on a leaf, wasps, ants or spiders might eat them.
The tadpoles can be 6.72 to 7.47 mm long when they first hatch and they can grow to 2.9 cm. They eat algae and hide in underwater plants.
The nematode worm parasite "Cosmocerca parva" can infect this frog.
This frog does not get very sick from the chytridiomycosis fungal disease the way many other frogs do. Scientists found that the microbiota of hourglass tree frogs, which is all the bacteria and other microorganisms that live on and in the frog's body, is different from the microbiota of other frogs. Scientists think this might protect the hourglass tree frog from chytridiomycosis but they are not sure.
Scientists and students use the hourglass tree frog as a test animal because it is not endangered and because it can lay eggs on land or in water. Humans also keep these frogs as pets.

He throws a bottle through Jerome's house. This accidentally starts a fire and burns Jerome's house. Jerome goes to Lois and says that he will hurt the guy who burned his house. He does not know that Peter did it. Lois lets Jerome stay in their house. Peter starts to act very jealously. He dresses as a ghost that makes him look like a member of the Ku Klux Klan. This was to make Jerome leave their house. Lois tells Peter in an argument that Jerome got him a gift. Peter goes back to Jerome and says he is sorry for acting badly to him. Jerome forgives Peter and they still be friends.
Brian wants to be in Peter's group of friends. Peter says that he can not because Quagmire does not like him. Brian goes to Quagmire's house and tries to be good to him. However, he makes Quagmire angry when he accidentally thinks his abused sister is his girlfriend. Brian tries to make Quagmire feel better by getting him to go to dinner.

Reception.
The episode was watched by about 7.38 million people when it was first broadcast.
Emily VanDerWerff from "The A.V. Club" thought that the episode's story started well but then got further bad in the episode. She thought that a "South Park" episode with a similar story of Kenny McCormick being replaced was done better. However, she said she liked Quagmire's long rant. Ahsan Haque from IGN did not like how the episode was made. Haque thought that the episode's story sounded better as an idea. Ramsey Isler (another IGN reviewer) said that the episode was not funny and the writing was lazy and not original.

Biedermeier was a time in the arts and German literature, which occurred between 1815 and 1848. In 1815, the Congress of Vienna ended the Napoleonic Wars. In 1848, there were revolutions in many European Countries. Between 1815 and 1848, the middle class grew. During that time, the forces that had been active before the French Revolution rose to power again. Politically, the times were very hard, and there was a lot of repression. For this reason, most of the arts focused on apolitical life at home. 
In painting, "Biedermeier" focused on landscapes, portraits, and perhaps still lifes, or genre paintings. There are almost no religious or historical paintings. Many painters wanted to copy or to resemble 17th century Dutch painters. Many paintings were realist, almost like a modern-day photograph. Interior portraits were typical for Biedermeier: there the idea was to show a fully furnished room, in all its details.
In music, there's no epoch called "Biedermeier": the only thing that is perhaps worth mentioning that playing music at home, in the family became important, this is known as house concert.
In theatre, the main focus was entertainment, not like the Age of Enlightenment. Also in addition to the national theatres, a number of smaller theatres started to exist.

The 2013 Pacific typhoon season was an above-normal Pacific typhoon season.
Seasonal forecasts.
During each season, many national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones, tropical storms, and typhoons will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a certain country. These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk  Consortium of the University College London, Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration and the Vietnamese National Center for Hydro Meteorological forecasts .
Storm names.
Within the North-western Pacific Ocean, both the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the Western Pacific, which can mean a tropical cyclone has two names. The Japan Meteorological Agency's RSMC Tokyo — Typhoon Center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization's Typhoon Committee, should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of . While the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135°E and 115°E and between 5°N-25°N even if the cyclone has had an international name given to it. The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired, by both PAGASA and the Typhoon Committee. Should the list of names for the Philippine region all be used, then names will be taken from an auxiliary list. The first ten of these names are made before the start of the season. Unused names are marked in .
International names.
During the season 29 tropical storms developed in the Western Pacific and each one was named by the JMA, when the system was judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of . The JMA selected the names from a list of 140 names, that had been developed by the 14 members nations and territories of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee. During the season the names Leepi and Mangkhut were used for the first time, after they had replaced the names Xangsane and Durian, which were retired after the 2006 season.
After the season the Typhoon Committee retired the names "Sonamu", "Utor", "Fitow" and "Haiyan" from its naming lists, and in February 2015, the names were subsequently replaced with "Jongdari", "Barijat", "Mun" and "Bailu" for future seasons.
Philippines.
During the season PAGASA used its own naming scheme for the 25 tropical cyclones, that either developed within or moved into their self-defined area of responsibility. The names were taken from a list of names, that had been last used during 2009 and was used again during 2017. The names Fabian, Odette and Paolo were used for the first time during the year after the names Ondoy, and Pepeng were retired. The names Wilma, Yolanda, and Zoraida were also used for the first time (and only in the case of Yolanda).
After the season the names Labuyo, Santi and Yolanda were retired by PAGASA, as they had caused over 300 deaths and over PhP1 billion in damages. They were soon replaced on the list with Lannie, Salome and Yasmin.
Season effects.
This table lists all the storms that developed in the northwestern Pacific Ocean west of the International Date Line and north of the equator during 2013. It includes their intensity, duration, name, areas affected, deaths, and damage totals. Classification and intensity values are based on estimations conducted by the JMA. All damage figures are in 2013 USD. Damages and deaths from a storm include when the storm was a precursor wave or an extratropical low.

The Gallic Wars were military campaigns waged by the Roman proconsul Julius Caesar against tribes in Gaul between 58 BC and 50 BC. The wars gave Rome rich farmlands in Gaul (roughly France and Belgium up to the Rhine).
Caesar's sub-commanders included Mark Antony, Titus Labienus, Quintus Tullius Cicero (brother of Marcus Tullius Cicero), Publius Licinius Crassus (brother of Marcus Licinus Crassus, the richest man in Rome), Decimus Brutus Albinus and Servius Sulpicius Galba (praetor 54 BC).
Julius Caesar described the Gallic Wars in his book "Commentarii de Bello Gallico". This is the main source, but it makes impossible claims about the number of Gauls killed (over a million), while claiming few Roman casualties. Modern historians believe that Gallic forces were far smaller than Caesar claimed, and that they (the Romans) suffered tens of thousands of casualties. One of the leaders of the Gauls, Vercingetorix, was taken to Rome, and later executed.
The main contemporary source for the conflict is Julius Caesar's "Commentarii de Bello Gallico". This was thought to be truthful and accurate until the 20th century. Even in 1908, Camille Jullian wrote a comprehensive history of Gaul and took Caesar's account as absolutely true. But after World War II, historians began to question if Caesar's claims stood up.
Modern estimates are that at the battle of Alesia, in 52 BC, there were about 70,000 Gauls, and the same number of Roman troops. That is still a very large number, in a world with far fewer people than is the case today.

When they are in a noisy environment, humans have the ability to focus their hearing onto one source. This phenomenon is called cocktail party effect. It is named after the fact that a person attending a noisy cocktail party is able to focus their listening to the conversation they are doing, and disregard the other conversations. 
It has been proposed that one's sensory memory subconsciously parses all stimuli and identifies discrete pieces of information by classifying them by salience. This effect is what allows most people to "tune into" a single voice and "tune out" all others. This phenomenon is often described in terms of "selective attention" or "selective hearing". It may also describe a similar phenomenon that occurs when one may immediately detect words of importance coming from unattended stimuli, for example hearing one's name among a wide range of auditory input.
An inability to segregate stimuli in this way is sometimes referred to as the cocktail party problem or cocktail party deafness.

The Big Three television networks are the three biggest television networks in the United States that are still running. These networks are ABC, CBS, and NBC. The Big Three networks ruled over television in the United States until the 1990s. To this day, they are still considered major, long-lasting United States television networks.
Backgrounds.
NBC and CBS were both founded as radio networks in the 1920s. Later on, NBC would have two radio networks for the United States. These networks were the Red Network and the Blue Network. They soon began television stations in the 1930s. In 1943, the U.S. government noticed how unfair it was for NBC to have two networks. They forced NBC to sell one of their networks. NBC chose to sell the Blue Network. Later on, the Blue Network became the ABC.
The DuMont Television Network launched in 1944. The three networks once controlled a few television stations. After a while, they affiliated with other stations to cover almost the entire United States by the late 1950s. Most of these stations are affiliated somehow with all three major networks and DuMont in markets where only one or two television stations operated in the early years of commercial television. It made some TV shows hard to handle. As more stations signed on, ABC, NBC, and CBS could carry enough programming on one station.
DuMont did not have a radio network like ABC or CBS. During all this, the Mutual Broadcasting System had considered creating a TV network. They would have Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer make some of the programming. WOR-TV &amp; WOIC were known as "Mutual Television." This is the only evidence of the television network. Mutual then bought a stake in the Overmyer Network in 1967. That network never succeeded.
Network competition.
Early years.
For most of television history, the Big Three controlled most of television. DuMont stopped airing in 1955. From 1961 to the early 1990s, there were only three networks. Every hit series and every feature movie was aired by one of the Big Three networks.
There were attempts to become the fourth network. But they never work out. The cost of starting a network, the difficulty of competing with the Big Three and broadcasting were common in the 1980s. The Big Three had just enough stations to defeat anyone who tried to be just like them. Those networks that could have had the chance to compete would shut down because of legal threats.
Fox.
An attempt for a fourth television network for the Big Three would not happen again until Fox was founded in October 1986. Fox became a fourth network in 1994 after a law forcing cable providers to add local stations was approved. The rules allowed Fox to become recognized by most audiences and become the fourth network.
Fox has beaten ABC and NBC in the ratings for its primetime programming. This made Fox become the second most-watched network behind CBS during the 2000s. From 2007 to 2008, Fox was the highest-rated of the big broadcast networks. Fox was even the first non-Big Three network to reach first place. From 2004 to 2012, Fox became known for its 18-49 demographic shows. Because of its success, it has been included with the Big Three. It was used with the term "Big Four."
Although Fox is known as the nation's fourth major network, it is not considered part of the Big Three. One reason being that Fox reduced its weekday programming. It does not have enough national morning and evening news programs. Fox does not feature any daytime programming, enough primetime, late-night talk shows, and Saturday morning children's programming. Fox had a block for children's programs in the 1990s called Fox Kids. However, it was sold to The Walt Disney Company in 2001 as part of Fox Family Channel.
Outside of prime time, Fox affiliates either make their programming or run syndicated shows. Fox also allows affiliates the option to air the Xploration Station block on Saturday mornings in place of the optional Weekend Marketplace infomercials block.
Fifth and sixth networks.
Other networks soon launched in an attempt to compete with the Big Three as well as Fox. However, these "netlets" were not as successful as Fox. The WB and UPN launched in 1995. Just like Fox, they both added nights of prime time programming a few years later. The WB was the only one that aired any on weekends.
Both networks only aired prime time and children's programming. The children's programming was the only form of weekday daytime programming offered by either one. UPN discontinued its children's programming in 2003 after a deal with Disney. After that, UPN aired sports events such as the XFL, as well as "WWF SmackDown!".
Although The WB and UPN both had some popular series during their time, they struggled from poor viewership and financial losses. It led their parent companies (Time Warner and CBS Corporation) to shut them down in 2006. They soon joined together in a joint venture called The CW. It originally had a mix of programs from their past networks. But they soon made new shows after the launch.
Fox launched MyNetworkTV at the same time as The CW, with a lineup of English language telenovelas. Later on, it shifted towards unscripted programs and movies. But because of low ratings, it led News Corporation to convert the channel into a syndication service in 2009.
PBS.
Like Fox, the PBS is not considered part of the Big Three networks. PBS is a noncommercial service with a different distribution model compared to the major networks. Its stations own the network rather than the network owning some of its stations and affiliating with additional stations owned by other broadcasters. It keeps memberships with more than one educational station.
Market share.
Today, the "Big Three" only control a small portion of the television market in the United States. It has suffered as a result of growing competition from other networks. Traditional networks such as Fox, The CW, and MyNetworkTV, Spanish language networks such as Univision and Telemundo, even national cable and satellite channels such as TNT, ESPN, and AMC, and web channels such as Netflix are sharing the space as well.

History.
Myanmar (also known as Burma) has been under military rule before. General Ne Win led a coup in 1962. In 1988, many people protested against the military government because they were not happy with it. They wanted elections with many parties running so that normal people could change the government. The military killed many protestors.(3000-10000 as estimated).
Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of General Aung San, who helped free Burma from British rule. After 1988, she became a pro-democracy activist. In 1990, her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), won the elections in a landslide. However, the government refused to say that her party won.
In 2011, Suu Kyi's party won the elections. However, she is not allowed to be president of the country because her family (her late husband Michael Aris and two sons) are British citizens. So she became State Counsellor, which is like a prime minister.
In 2020, there was an election in Myanmar. The NLD won the election but Tatmadaw accused that there was an election fraud and made a coup at the early morning of February 1st of 2021. However, the proof that there was a fraud is not found, so far and people believes that Tatmadaw made the coup because the generals wants to restart the military dictatorship which ended about 10 years ago. After coup, people protests began in the whole country with many people because they wanted their elected government back but Tatmadaw disagree and killed many protesting people (around 1000 estimated), which led the People Defensive War, the national wide armed resistance against the military regime,
Events.

National Foundation Day (������, Kenkoku Kinen no Hi) is a national holiday in Japan celebrated annually on 11 February. It celebrates the legendary foundation of Japan, and the accession of its first emperor, Emperor Jimmu, at Kashihara gū.
History.
According to Shinto tradition, Emperor Jimmu ascended the throne in 660 BC. During the Meiji period, historians said this was 11 February 660 BC.
The holiday was celebrated for the first time in 1873 AD. They called it the National Empire Day. Historians believe that the Meiji government did this to make the Meiji Emperor look like a successor of Emperor Jimmu. The Meiji-era constitution was announced on February 11 1889.
After the occupation ended, nationalist groups in Japan tried to convince the government to bring back the holiday. After a few years, they did. They called it National Foundation Day instead of National Empire Day and removed most of the imperial imagery.
Today, some groups in Japan like National Foundation Day and other groups protest it because they think it is too close to the actions that led up to World War II.

A universe that is fine-tuned is a universe that is designed well-enough to support life. Life as we know it would be impossible if certain things in physics were slightly different. Our universe is fine-tuned for life, and this is seen as not likely. This is because many things have to come together in a certain way. One explanation for this is the anthropic principle. This means that the universe supports life because we wouldn't be here to wonder that if it didn't. This usage of the anthropic principle is tautological. This means that it is true because it is true.
Another explanation for this is the teleological argument. It is also known as argument from design. This means that an intelligent creator created the universe. It is still unknown if the universe created itself or if it was created by someone or something else.
Examples.
Martin Rees had six of these examples. Some of these are:

Shakti (Devanagari: �����, IAST: Śakti; lit. "Energy, ability, strength, effort, power, capability") is the primordial cosmic energy and represents the dynamic forces that are thought to move through the entire universe in Hinduism, and especially Shaktism, a major tradition of Hinduism. Shakti is the personification of the energy that is creative, sustaining, as well as destructive, sometimes referred to as auspicious source energy.
As the Shakti or Creatrix, She is known as Adi Parashakti or "Adi Param Shakti" or simply "Adi Shakti" (i.e., Primordial Inconceivable Energy). On every plane of creation, energy manifests itself in all forms of matter, thermal energy, potential energy, gravitational energy etc. These are all thought to be infinite forms of the Para Shakti. But Her true form is unknown, and beyond human understanding. She is "Anaadi" (with no beginning, no ending) and "Nitya" (forever).
In Shaktism, Adi Parashakti is worshipped as the Supreme Being.
Origin.
Found in a Paleolithic context in the Son River valley and dating to 9,000–8,000 BCE, the Baghor stone, says Jonathan Mark Kenoyer, is highly probable that the stone is associated with Shakti. The worshipping of Shiv and Shakti was also prevalent in Indus valley civilization.
Evolution.
The Shakti goddess is also known as "Amma" in south India, especially in the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh. There are many temples devoted to various incarnations of the Shakti goddess in most of the villages in South India. The rural people believe that Shakti is the protector of the village, the punisher of evil people, the cure of diseases, and the one who gives welfare to the village. They celebrate Shakti Jataras with great interest once a year. Some examples of Shakti names are Mahalakshmi, Kamakshi, Parvati, Lalita, Bhuvaneshwari, Durga, Meenakshi, Mariamman, Yellamma, Poleramma, and Perantalamma.
Shaktisim.
Sri Guru Amritananda Nath Saraswati, performing the Navavarana Puja, an important ritual in Srividya Tantric Shaktism, at the Sahasrakshi Meru Temple at Devipuram, Andhra Pradesh, India.
Shaktism regards Devi (lit., "the Goddess") as the Supreme Brahman itself with all other forms of divinity considered to be merely Her diverse manifestations. In the details of its philosophy and practice, Shaktism resembles Shaivism. However, "Shaktas" (Sanskrit: ����, "Śakta", ), practitioners of Shaktism, focus most or all worship on Shakti, as the dynamic feminine aspect of the Supreme Divine. Shiva, the masculine aspect of divinity, is considered solely transcendent, and Shiva's worship is usually secondary.
Shakti Peeths.
According to some schools, there are four Adi Shakti Pitha and 51 Shakti centers of worship located in South Asia (four Adi Shakti Pitha are also part of 51 Shakti pithas but they are four major parts of Devi Sati's body. So, they are adi shakti pithas). They can be found in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan. These are called Shakti Peethas. The list of locations varies. A commonly accepted list of Shakti Peethas and their temple complexes includes:
Other pithas in Maharashtra are:
Bhajans and mantras.
There are many ancient Shakti devotional songs and vibrational chants in the Hindu and Sikh traditions (found in Sarbloh Granth). The recitation of the Sanskrit mantras is commonly used to call upon the Divine Mother.
"Merge in the Maha Shakti. This is enough to take away your misfortune. This will carve out of you a woman. Woman needs her own Shakti, not anybody else will do it ... When a woman chants the Kundalini Bhakti mantra, God clears the way. This is not a religion, it is a reality. Woman is not born to suffer, and woman needs her own power."

The Goon Show was a British radio comedy programme, produced and broadcast by the BBC Home Service from 1951 to 1960. Occasional repeats were on the BBC Light Programme. The first series was broadcast from 28 May to 20 September 1951. It was titled Crazy People; later series had the title "The Goon Show".
The show's chief creator and main writer was Spike Milligan. 
The show was acted by Peter Sellers, Harry Secombe and Milligan. Michael Bentine was also a member until 1953. 
Each of the actors played several stock characters, a regular pattern in radio and theatrical comedy. By "stock characters" is meant characters whose idiosyncracies (peculiaririties) is well understood by the listening audience. This was also a feature of much music hall entertainment.
The scripts mixed ludicrous plots with surreal humour, puns, catchphrases and an array of bizarre sound effects. Some of the later episodes had electronic effects devised by the fledgling BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Many of these ideas were reused by other shows for decades. Elements of the show satirised life in Britain, parodying aspects of show business, commerce, industry, art, politics, diplomacy, the police, the military, education, class structure, literature and films.
The show was preceded by Ted Ray's "Ray's a Laugh" as the key comedy programme on BBC radio.
The "Goon Show" had an influence on the later BBC television series "Monty Python". Both were absurdist comedies.

A stock character is a stereotype fictional character. In a theatre, novel, play or film, the audience immediately knows about him or her without further explanation. All types of fiction use this device, especially comedy.
They have been used in all forms of theatre, right back to the Ancient Greek theatre. The Star Wars movie franchise offers many examples. They are archetypal characters, simplified and "flat". As a result, they may be easy targets for parody, and criticized as clichés. Stock characters help to identify a genre or subgenre. For example, a fairy tale or fantasy is likely to have a knight-errant as hero and a witch as opposition.
One stock character often used is the low-class character(s) who warn the hero of danger to come. Examples:
It seems their function is to introduce the idea of fatalism, the idea that we are not masters of our fate. Human fame and glory is temporary. Even Achilles has his weakness.
As the hero falls, he is usually allowed a final comment. Caesar's was "Et tu, Brute?" meaning "Not you as well, Brutus?" That's known as a valediction (means a farewell comment). Shakespeare has many examples: Another famous example is Richard III's last cry of "A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!"

An obscene phone call is when someone uses bad, sexual or hateful language while talking to another person on a telephone.
In many U.S. states, making an obscene telephone call is a Class 1 Misdemeanor.
The victims of substandard or obscene telephone calls should hang up on the callers and report the incidents to their telephone company or local police.
Even if/when Caller IDs aren't shown, calls are logged by the telephone company. This is so the obscene caller's number can be discovered. But many obscene phone callers use payphones or mobile phones instead of regular landline phones.

Some obscene phone callers have trouble forming relationships, so making obscene telephone calls is the only way they express themselves.
The usual age for making such telephone calls is the teenage years, particularly ages 12 to 16. The average age is 14.

Other historical sources, such as the Puranas and the works of Chinese and Greek historians, also provide some information about Samudragupta's reign, but do not provide a comprehensive list of all his military campaigns.

Often these are considered as battles where samudragupta was never defeated however there may be battles excluding these where he may have lost and we don't know the Source for this yet.
Extent of the empire.
Samudragupta's empire included a core territory in northern India. It was directly controlled by the emperor. Besides, it included some monarchical and tribal tributary states. Historian R. C. Majumdar theorizes that Samudragupta directly controlled an area extending from the Ravi River (Punjab) in the west to the Brahmaputra River (Bengal and Assam) in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to the Vindhya hills in the south. The south-western boundary of his territory roughly followed a line drawn from present-day Karnal to Bhilsa.
In the south, Samudragupta's empire definitely included Eran in present-day Madhya Pradesh. On there, his inscription has been found. The Allahabad Pillar inscription suggests that he reached early up to Kanchipuram in the south. However, since the claims in the Allahabad Pillar inscription are from a royal eulogy, they must be treated with danger.
Personality.
Samudragupta's coins show him as a tall, strong man. The Allahabad Pillar inscription presents him as a compassionate ruler. It was stated that his "mind was engaged in providing relief to the low, the poor, the helpless, and the afflicted". It also stated that he reinstated many royal families which had lost their kingdoms, including the kings defeated by him. At the same time, it states that he maintained strict administration ("Prachanda shasana").
The inscription states that Samudragupta became famous among the learned people because of his poetical works. He earned the epithet "king of poets". This suggests that he composed some poetical works. But none of these works now survive.
The inscription also says that Samudragupta embarrassed the celestial musician Tumburu and Narada by his lovely performances of music. Samudragupta's musical talents are also corroborated by his gold coins which depict him playing a veena. 
The inscription praises Samudragupta's wisdom and intellect. It was stated that he was smarter than the preceptor of the Lord of the Gods (that is, Brihaspati).

The Acasta Gneiss is the oldest rock in the world. It is in the Slave craton in Northwest Territories, Canada. 
The rock body is exposed on an island about 300 kilometres north of Yellowknife. The rock of the outcrop was metamorphosed 3.58 to 4.031 billion (109) years ago. It is the oldest known intact crustal fragment on Earth.
The nearby Acasta River east of Great Bear Lake gave the rock its name. It is the oldest known exposed rock in the world.
The rock, before it was metamorphized, was a granitoid that formed 4.03 billion years ago. This age is based on radiometric dating of zircon crystals at 4.031x109 years. The Acasta Gneiss is important in establishing the early history of the continental crust.

Untriseptium (), also called eka-dubnium or element 137, is a possible chemical element which has not been synthesized. Due to instabilities, it is not known if this element is possible, as the instabilities may hint that the periodic table ends soon after the island of stability at unbihexium. Its atomic number is 137 and symbol is Uts.
The name "untriseptium" is a temporary name.
Importance.
It is sometimes called feynmanium (symbol Fy) because Richard Feynman noted that a simplistic interpretation of the relativistic Dirac equation runs into problems with electron orbitals at "Z" &gt; 1/� = 137, suggesting that neutral atoms cannot exist beyond untriseptium, and that a periodic table of elements based on electron orbitals breaks down at this point. However, a more thorough analysis calculates the limit to be around element 173.

Bullion (from the french word for "boiling") refers to coins, jewellery and bars made of a precious metal such as gold or silver, that are bought and stored simply as an investment in the prices of the metal(s) they are made of. Although precious metal bullion is no longer used to make coins for general circulation, it continues to be held as an investment with a reputation for stability in periods of economic uncertainty.
Unlike numismatic coins, a bullion coin is a coin, new or old, that is bought only for the price of the metal it is made of, not for its condition, age or any other value, british gold sovereigns are a common historic bullion coin, and most countries produce a coin meant solely for bullion purposes in different weights, e.g american silver eagle.
Bullion can also be in the form of bars of precious metal in different weights (and thus sizes) bars can easily be stacked and are easier to sort then coins as only the weight needs to be taken into consideration.
It may also be jewellery such as neck chains, pocket watch cases and pendants.
Typical bullion metals include:
Due to it's relatively small size and high value, bullion is often stolen in robberies and burglaries, as a result it is mainly stored in safes, some people who invest in bullion may choose to pay to have it stored in a safe deposit box at a local bank, rather then a safe in their own home.
"Stacking" is an informal term for the act of collecting bullion.
Low value bullion is sometimes carried in a pocket or worn as jewellery.

The Australian magpie ("Gymnorhina tibicen") is a large black-and-white bird. It lives in most parts of Australia and in a small part of New Guinea. It is not closely related to the European magpie: they just look rather similar.
Australian magpies are related to butcherbirds and currawongs. They are in the family Artamidae. 
The Australian magpie is in its own genus "Gymnorhina" and is related to the black butcherbird ("Melloria quoyi"). They live in bush land and in cities near people. 
Description.
Australian magpies are from 37 to 43 cm long. They do not have very long tails like European magpies. 
An adult magpie has red eyes, black legs, and a white beak with black tip. 
There are nine kinds of magpies (subspecies or races) in different parts of the country. Some subspecies have black backs and some have white.
Behaviour.
They walk on the ground where they look for insects and lizards to eat. Many other birds hop (move with small jumps), but magpies walk. When they are not looking for food, they stand or perch by holding on with their feet while they stand or crouch in trees or on man-made structures. 
When magpies have baby chicks in their nests, the adults will “swoop” at nearby people – flying at their heads – to chase them away.
Some people feed magpies by throwing small pieces of meat to them. Magpies can learn to come near humans for food. They do not usually let people touch them.

The Australasian strewnfield is the youngest and largest of the tektite strewnfields. Recent estimates suggest it may cover 10%30% of the Earth's surface. Tektites are gravel-sized bodies composed of black, green, brown, or grey natural glass. They are formed from terrestrial debris ejected by meteorite impacts.
The strewnfield is about c. 790,000-year-old. It includes most of Southeast Asia (Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Southern China). The material from the impact stretches across the ocean to include the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Java. It also reaches far west out into the Indian Ocean, and south to Australia and Tasmania. Since the 1960s, it has been accepted that the strewn field included Hainan in southern China to Australia or about 10% of the Earth's surface. This was later extended by finds in Africa and Tasmania to 20%. Recent additional finds in northern Tibet and Guangxi increased the strewnfield to about 30% of the Earth's surface, or almost 150 million km2, or about the size of the entire world's landmass.
The glass comes from the melting of local rocks due to the impact of a large meteorite. The assumed source is a 1.2-kilometer-wide topographic depression in Tasmania known as Darwin Crater. The crater is filled with 230 metres of sediments and breccia. A crater of that size would be caused by a meteorite 20 to 50 metres in diameter.

The office of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was created after the Northern Ireland government (at Stormont) was suspended. The government was later ended after civil problems.

The Far Eastern Championship Games (also known as the Far Eastern Championships, Far Eastern Games or Far East Games) was an Asian multi-sport event considered to be a precursor to the Asian Games.
History.
In 1913, Elwood Brown, president of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Association and Manila Carnival Games, proposed the creation of the "Far Eastern Olympic Games" to China and Japan. It was at that time that Governor-General William Cameron Forbes was the president of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation from 1911-1913. Governor-General Forbes formed the Far Eastern Olympic Association.
The first event was held on the Manila Carnival grounds (later the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex) in Malate, Manila, Philippines on February 4, 1913 and was known as the "First Oriental Olympic Games". Forbes was also the one who formally declare the games open. Six countries participated in the eight-day event: the host country then-named Philippine Islands, Republic of China, Empire of Japan, British East Indies (Malaysia), Kingdom of Thailand and British crown colony Hong Kong.
In 1915, the name changed to Far Eastern Championship Games and the association to Far Eastern Athletic Association when the event was held at Hongkou Park in Shanghai, China. They were held there again in 1921. The games were held every two years except in 1929 when Japan decided to delay the project to 1930.

The 1934 edition was held in a period of dispute between China and Japan, following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Inclusion of people from this region in the games caused controversy between the two member nations, which resulted in the break-up of the Far Eastern Athletic Association. In September 1937, Japan invaded China with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and started the Second Sino-Japanese War (which later became part of World War II), thus the planned games in 1938 were cancelled.

Nongda Lairen Pakhangba (') or Nongda Lairel Pakhangba (') was officially the first Meitei king of the Ningthouja dynasty. He was coronated in the Kangla of Kangleipak (" realm") in 33 AD. He rose to power after defeating the Khabas.
According to Paratt, before the times of king Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, the "salai"s () were already in existence.
Nongda Lairen Pakhangba started unifying the warring ethnic groups and principality groups positively. It led to the formation of Manipur realm, under the political supremacy of the Ningthouja dynasty (Mangang clan) in the first century AD. Despite the historical context, with the usage of the title "Pakhangba", he was often deified with various mythological tales, revolving around his identity as a human incarnation of God Pakhangba (frequently mentioned in the alias "Konjil Tuthokpa").
According to Sujit Mukherjee, Nongda Lairen Pakhangba ruled from 33 AD to 54 AD ("21 years of reign"). The Cheitharol Kumbaba also recorded the list of Meitei kings, starting from Nongda Lairen Pakhangba. The record has several versions. However, the most authentic record is the one that is preserved in the Royal Palace of Manipur. The information on the Cheitharol Kumbaba is supplemented by that in the , which also records the details of the Meitei kings, starting from Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, regarding their parentage and important events in their reigns.
According to Prof. P. Gunindra Singh, coins were issued by Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, which served as one of the significant evidences relevant to the study of the subject.
One of the most remarkable historical events occurred during the times of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was the organising of a match of polo () sports, played by his friends, in the (), the oldest Polo Ground in the world.
Name.
The name "Pakhangpa" () was mentioned in the ancient Meitei text, named the "Thanglon Thangchat". However, due to the given name "Pakhangba", being possessed by multiple historical personalities in ancient times, the identity of the "Pakhangba" mentioned in the text is questionable. Notably, there were four notable people named "Pakhangba", who are (1) "Leinung Lonja Ariba Pakhangba", (2) "Tangja Leela Pakhangba", (3) "Lolang Pakhangba", and (4) "Nongda Lairen Pakhangba" himself. They lived in different times in the history of Manipur.
The title "Pakhangba" is used by the historical kings who are considered to be "enlightened". King Nongta Lailen ("Nongda Lairen") was one among the historical personalities to use the title "Pakhangba". Many scholars compared the usage of the title "Pakhangba" by Meitei kings with that of the title "Buddha", used by the people who are considered to be "The Awakened One" or "The Enlightened One". 
King Pakhangba inherited the political powers as he followed the traditional practices of his forefathers and paid respect for his ancestral rituals.
Rise to power.
According to Hareshwar Goshwami's "History of the People of Manipur" as well as the ancient Meitei text , Nongda Lairen Pakhangba subjugated the powers of "Sorarel Ariba Ahum", who were the chiefs of three clans, viz. Chengleis, Luwangs and Nganbas.
Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was challenged by Poireiton, for the throne of the Kangla. In the conflict, the former defeated the latter. With the accession of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba to the throne of the Kangla, other clans including the Chengleis and Khaba Nganbas lost their sovereignty. The Angoms and the Luwangs, though independent, shared their political powers with Nongda Lairen Pakhangba.
Some scholars opined that under the administration of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, his capital was divided into 4 "pana"s (). The 4 panas include Ahallup Pana, Naharup Pana, Laipham Pana and Khabam Pana. However, some scholars are of the opinion that the "Pana" system is a later interpolation, by stating that "Pana" came into existence during Meitei King Khagemba's era.
Family.
Nongda Lairen Pakhangba's queen consort, Leima Leisana (also called "Laisna"), was a maibi (). Leisana and her brother "Poireiton" had their origin from a distant place in the east. When she and her brother came to the realm of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, they were accompanied by the Poirei people. She brought two hundred varieties of fruits and vegetables. Legend says that one hundred of the varieties were meant to be cooked and the rest of the hundred were meant to be eaten raw.
Administration.
During the reign of king Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, the "Kuchu" (, /kū.chū/) was established in his kingdom. It was the highest level court (supreme court), having legal jurisdictions over both criminal cases as well as civil cases. The king was the president of the court, and his nobles as well as ministers served as its members.
The "Kuchu" court also used to perform trials of women's cases. The concept of the liberation of women (feminist movement) was already prevalent in that era. The roles of women in their families' decision making processes were considerably significant.
The "Cheirap" ("derived from the word "Cheirak"") was established during the reign of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in his kingdom. In Meitei language, "Cheirap" (, /cə�i.rap/) means "court". In Meitei language, "Cheirak" (, /cə�i.rak/) means "punishment" or "said of strict control to enforce obedience".
Starting from the era of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in the 1st century AD, "Pacha Loishang" (also spelled as "Patcha")() was established in Kangleipak. The court protected the women's rights, privileges, rights against immoral trafficks. During his time, his queen consort "Laisna" presided over the court, dealing all women related crimes.
The Lallup system was established during the reign of King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in his kingdom. The "Lallup" (also spelled as "Lalup") was a practice of forced labor and free labour in services to the sovereign or to the state.
Development of art and culture.
When Nongda Lairen Pakhangba and his queen consort "Laishna" were coronated in 33 AD, the ritual song "Ougri" was sung. "Ougri" ritual song can bring either prosperity or ruination to the civilization. Since then, it became customary to recite "Ougri" during the coronations of every Meitei kings. These recitations of the verses, during the royal coronation of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in 33 AD, were recorded in the ancient text, "Laisrapham".
During the era of "Nongda Lairen Pakhangba", a court singer named "Leinung Tharuk Asheiba" initiated the performance of the traditional musical instrument Pena.
According to Dr. Yumlembam Gopi, the Ancient Meiteis used to play "khung", a playing instrument, prior to the era of "Nongda Lairen Pakhangba" in 33 AD. The "khung" (, /khuŋ/) is a cone-shaped toy, similar to the top.
The Hiyang Tannaba () festival had been celebrated since the time of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in his kingdom.
The Mera Hou Chongba (also spelled as "Mera Hao Chonba") was believed to be introduced by Nongda Lairen Pakhangba. It is a festival in which dignitaries from all the ethnic groups assembled together in the Kangla. It is annually celebrated on the 10th day of the Meitei lunar month of "Mera" (October-November interface month).
Official groups of medical care.
During the reigns of Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in the 1st century AD, his younger sister named "Panthoibi", established the "Ametpa Loishang" (). The Loishang () used to perform the treatment and the diagnosis of diseases and sicknesses, including boils, abscesses, ulcers, etc. "Laibi", a post in that office, supervised the procedures. "Metpi"s used to perform delivery and child birth. "Metpi Laibi"s were responsible for the treatment of diseases for the Queen and other imperial consorts. "Metpi Laibi"s always used to accompany the king wherever he went, by bringing medical tools and medicines. The text "Loishangi Thouram Thougal" mentioned about the duties of the Loishang and the "Laibi". The text "Masil" (also spelled as "Masin", ) mentioned about the "Metpi"s and the "Metpi Laibi"s.
Death or dethronement.
Though almost all the scholars have a consensus on the year of the coronation of King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba as AD 33, regarding the year of the end of his reign, which maybe either due to his death or due to being abdicated, is still disputed.
In accordance with Sujit Mukherjee, Nongda Lairen Pakhangba ruled from 33 AD to 54 AD ("21 years of reign").
Many sources claim that Nongda Lairen Pakhangba ruled from 33 AD to 153 AD (120 years of reign).
Many sources claim that Nongda Lairen Pakhangba ruled from 33 AD to 154 AD (121 years of reign).
AD 54, AD 153 or AD 154 maybe either his year of "death" or "removal from the power of monarchy", which is not confirmed.
Some scientists estimate that in case of the most ideal conditions people can live up to 127 years. This does not exclude the theoretical possibility that in the case of a fortunate combination of mutations there could be a person who lives longer. 
Some scientists cautiously suggest that the human body can have sufficient resources to live up to 150 years.
According to Anuradha Dutta and ‎Ratna Bhuyan, Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was murdered and his queen Laisana saved their son, "the prince".
Worship as a god.
In traditional Meitei religion.
Nongda Lairen Pakhangba was considered as an ancestor, later worshipped as a God. Some scholars opined that people of later generations wove mythological stories around him. However, some are of the opinion that he was a God living with the human beings and behaving like a normal human.
According to superstitious people, Pakhangba was a demigod, appearing "divine" in daytime and appearing "humanly" in nighttime. With this, the theory of Meitei kings being of "divine origin" started. The identity of the historical king Pakhangba got mingled up with that of the serpentine dragon god Pakhangba of ancient Meitei mythology and religion.
In Hinduism.
According to Thomas Callan Hodson's "The Meitheis" (1908), with the influence of Hinduism, new mythological tales tainted the identity of King Pakhangba. According to one Hindu lore, King Pakhangba was said to be born to "Enoog Howba Chonoo", who was said to be the wife of Babrubahana, by the end of the Dvapara Yuga ("Dapar Jug") and by the beginning of the Kali Yuga ("Kali Jug"), which is estimated to be around the year 3435. Hindu names were given as aliases to King Pakhangba. For example, "Jobista" (also spelled as "Yavista") was given as a synonym for King Pakhangba. According to another Hindu lore, King Pakhangba was claimed as the grandson of Babruvahana (Arjuna's son) and the son of Sooprabahoo (Babruvahana's son), thereby drawing relationship with the characters in the Mahabharata.
In the 18th century AD, the "Vijay Panchali" (also spelled as "Bijoy Panchali") composed by Shantidas Goswami, a Hindu missionary, attempting to erase the history and the culture of Manipur, projected the land of northeast India's Manipur as the Manipur of the Mahabharata and claimed Babruvahana (Arjuna's son) as the father of King Nongda Lairen Pakhangba, by identifying him as "Yavistha".
Notably, in the year 2020, "A Short History of Manipur", a book written by Rajkumar Jhalajit Singh, was banned from publishing and selling by the author's own family members, because the book misleads the readers that the Manipuris are the descendants of Arjuna of the Mahabharata.
In art and culture.
In the Kangla of Imphal, Manipur, there is an annual flag hoisting ceremony of "Nongda Lairen Pakhangba" organised by Nahanong Kanglei Laining Liklam (NKLL). 
Ritual ceremonies are performed and the "Salai Taret Huiyen Lalong Thang-Ta Lup", giving guard of honour, hoists the flag of Nongda Lairen Phakhangba.
The ceremony is performed for the purpose to preserve and promote the indigenous art and culture of Kangleipak.

Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi () or Chingphuron Konthousu () is a goddess in Meitei mythology and religion (Sanamahism) of Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur). She began as a human being in the Haorok Konthou group (Konthoujam clan). She is the wife of the sky god Salailen (alias Soraren). Her only child is Khoriphaba.
Mythology.
Konthoujamba and Konthoujambi were a couple with no child. They consulted maibas but the maibas could not help them have a child. They prayed to God Salailen, the King of Heaven, to help them. God Salailen heard their prayer and told the goddess Imoinu to help the couple. Goddess Imoinu implanted herself into the womb of Lady Konthoujambi.
When Konthoujambi was pregnant with a 3 month old fetus, God Salailen instructed her that her child will be His wife in the future. Later, Konthoujambi gave birth to a baby girl. The couple named their daughter "Chingphulon Konthousu" (later known as "Tampha").
As Chingphulon Konthousu grew up, she was known for her beauty and gentleness. She used to go to woods, lakes and open meadows for fun. One day, while Tampha was out in an open field with her friends, a strong wind blew. Tampha was lifted up by a whirlwind towards the sky. Her friends could do nothing but watch. The wind took her to heaven, the abode of Salailen. He was waiting for her.
Tampha was unhappy about being far away from her parents and friends. To please her, Salailen promised her that the people of her native place would attain immortality and be safe from all diseases. Still, her parents, family and friends cried for the loss of her. Salailen told them that Tampha was safe with him. He told them about the promises he kept to her. Many years had passed and Salailen and Tampha had a son. She and Salailen named their son Khoriphaba.
Tampha's parents wanted to see her. So they planned to meet her. Men went on a hunting expedition with their hunting dogs across the Thangjing Hills. Unfortunately, they could not catch even one animal. The tired hunters rested under the shade of a tree. Meanwhile, one of their favorite hunting dogs wandered away. The dog saw a large python sitting in sun. It barked at the python. The python killed it. Later, the hunters found the dead dog and carried it home. They prepared a funeral for the dog. The smoke from the funeral rose up towards the sky.
Up in Heaven, Tampha saw the smoke rising from her native place. She knew it was for a funeral. She worried about her people. Perhaps someone had died even though Salailen had promised to keep them safe from disease. She asked Salailen about his promises. Salailen told her that the funeral was only for a dog. She did not believe him and wanted to see her parents. Reluctantly, Salailen allowed her to meet people under some conditions. She should leave only after their son Khoriphaba had gone to sleep and should come back before he woke up. Also, she should not consume any earthly foods or drinks. Then, he placed a golden ladder (or "golden stairs" in another version) for her to climb down. She landed on the Thangjing Hill and then went to Konthoujam, her native land. She met her near and dear ones. Her mother offered Tampha delicious foods.
Tampha did not accept her mother's offers. However, her mother caught hold of her and tried to force her to eat. Tampha told her mother of the conditions with which she was leaving heaven to meet them on earth. Then, her mother arranged a shade with seven layers of false ceiling, enclosed by seven layers of drapery. Her plan was to block the vision of Salailen from above. Inside the shades, she served out delicious food for Tampha. Poor Tampha was compelled to eat what her mother had so lovingly prepared for her. But the God Salailen saw it happen even through the drapes. As Tampha started eating, Salailen proclaimed from heaven that she could not come back to his abode. He spat a blob of spit on her hand (or "on her food" in another version). The golden ladder (or "golden stairs" in another version) was also lifted up. Poor Tampha was abandoned from heaven. Salailen also took back his promises of immortality and immunity to disease. 
Later, she lived in the outskirts of Konthoujam. Since then, she came to be known as Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi.

The Nashya Shaikh or Nashya Sekh(Bengali: ����� ���) is a Muslim community found in northern parts of the state of West Bengal in India. They are culturally and linguistically similar to both Rangpuri people of northern Bangladesh and Goalpariya people of Assam. A small number of the community are also found in the neighboring state of Bihar, where they are known as the Bengali Shaikh. These people are more commonly known as Rajbongshi Muslims. The Nashya are considered to be an important indigenous group found in northern West Bengal. They are homogeneous with the Koch Rajbongshi people and are bi-linguistic speaking both Bengali language and Koch language with Koch Rajbongshi language being replaced by Bengali language among the newer generations.
Etymology.
There are descendants from Koch-Rajbonshi, Mech, Rabha, Bodo and Indo-Aryan people who converted to Islam. They mainly speak the Goalpariya dialect . They are mainly settled in the districts of Dhuburi, Goalpara, South Salmara and Kokrajhar. These people were loose followers of Hinduism. But when a small section of these people converted to Islam, the act was frowned upon. The local Hindus started calling them "nosto seikh" meaning "spoiled Shaikh". But as more number of people got converted to Islam with time these people came in contact with mainstream Muslims, and the term "nosto seikh" slowly got islamicised into "Nashya seikh".
Origin.
The Nashyas trace their origin to the indigenous communities of Koch Rajbongshi of northern West Bengal, though some of them are also from Mech community. There conversion to Islam is said to have taken over two to three centuries, and the Nashya still retain many cultural traits of their pre-Islamic past. Most people of the community are non-practicing Muslims though the newer generations are becoming increasing Islamic due to globalization. From historic evidence, it seems a segment of the indigenous population of north Bengal converted started to convert to Islam when the region fell under the control of Bakhtiyar Khilji. Some of the earliest converts were the chiefs Ali Mach and Kala Pahar. Tradition also ascribes the conversion of several lineages to Sufi saints such as Torsa Pir, Pagla Pir, Shah Fakir Sahib and Shah Gari Sahib.

Panthoibi () or Panthoipi () is a goddess in the Meitei mythology and religion. People in Ancient Kangleipak (Antique Manipur) worshipped her. She is the goddess of civilization, courage, having children, making things with hands, love, winning, war and wisdom. She is married to Nongpok Ningthou.
Col. John Shakespear wrote that Panthoibi is the most famous goddess in the Meitei religion.
People talk about Panthoibi with another goddess, Leimarel Sidabi. Sometimes people think of Panthoibi and Leimarel as the same goddess.
People say Panthoibi is bold, brave, and independent. She always works for what is good and right for Meitei women.
Etymology.
The Meitei word "Panthoibi" (�������� or ��������) comes from three words, "Pan" (���), "Thoi" (��� or ���) and "Bi" (��).
"Pan" (���) means "to rule over something".
"Thoi" (��� or ���) means "to ", or "to ", or "to ", or "to ", or "to ".
In Meitei language, "Bi" ("Bee") (��) or "Pi" ("Pee") (��) means that the rest of the word has a feminine gender. For example, Thoibi is a name given to girls. It has "Thoi" and "Bi".
The word "Thoibi" (����� or �����) also means or beautiful and .

The Cheitharol Kumbaba says people built the first temple to Panthoibi in 1686, and a statue in 1699.
In the 18th century, fewer people worshipped Panthoibi. This because the religion Vaishnavism became common in Manipur. Hindu King Garib Niwaj Pamheiba (1709-1748) pulled down the temples to Panthoibi. He broke the statues of her. Her last temple was built in 1700. After that, people did not build new temples until modern times.
Starting in the 18th century, people said the Meitei goddess Panthoibi was the same goddess as the Hindu goddess Durga. People worshipped her for five days in September or October.
In the 1960s, some people started to worship Panthoibi instead of Durga.

Mythology.
Panthoibi was very beautiful. She was a daughter of a Meitei king. Many kings and princes wanted to marry her. King Shapaiba () was one of them. He promised her he would build good roads, beautiful bridges, a big house and fish ponds. But she did not agree to marry him. Finally, Panthoibi married Tarang Khoinucha (alias Taram Khoinucha). He was the son of King Khaba Sokchrongba and Queen Teknga of the Khaba dynasty. Her marriage ceremony was wonderful. 
Meeting Nongpok Ningthou.
Panthoibi first met Nongpok Ningthou (alias Angoupa Kainou Chingsangsompa) five days after her wedding. She was walking in the grass and swimming in a river. She liked his handsome looks and personality. They fell in love. Nongpok Ningthou asked her to run away from her husband and marry him. But she did not say yes then. She told him to wait.
Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou secretly met many times. Panthoibi's husband's parents started to think something was wrong. Tarang Khoinucha tried to win her heart many times. Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou ran away together. They wore clothes as disguises.
Panthoibi and Nongpok Ningthou married on the sunny side of the Nongmaiching Hills. The gods celebrated with dancing and music (by the "Langmai people" and not the "gods" in another version). This celebration was the start of the Lai Haraoba festival.
Another version.
In another way of telling the story, Panthoibi first met Nongpok Ningthou when she was helping her father at farming. The two fell in love before they had talked. But Panthoibi got married to another man even though she did not want to. Later, she left her husband's house to search for Nongpok Ningthou. Nongpok Ningthou also left his home to look for Panthoibi. The two met at the Kangla. Kangla became the place of their divine union. This is why Meitei kings do their crowning ceremony there.
Panthoibi and the Sun God.
According to the Numit Kappa text (c. 1st century), in ancient times, there were two suns in the sky. An archer hero ("many men" in some version) shot one of the suns with an arrow and hurt it. The two brother suns ran away out of the sky. They hid for ten long days. The world was dark. No men could work. Crops and cows died. Then the ten godly kings (or "kingly gods") talked to the other gods. They asked each to talk to the Sun God. None succeeded. Finally, the ten gods came to Princess Panthoibi. She showed them magical ceremonies to get the Sun God to come back. The unhurt Sun God came back, but the archer hit with the arrow did not.
Panthoibi and the weaving spider.
Panthoibi saw a spider. It was making good, thin thread. It was also making a web. From this, she started weaving. The god of weaving is female because women were the ones who wove cloth.
Pottery and human civilization.
After the first human beings, Panthoibi made them a place to live. Humans started eating and drinking. Panthoibi realised they needed someplace to put food and water. So she started making pots. In the beginning, she did not know how to make a pot. Later, she looked around. She saw a flower - "Nura Khudonglei" (""). She saw its shape. Then, she made a pot. Since then, humans could make pots for cooking food and drinking water.

Description.
Nongthang Leima is a pre-historical maibi. She is the first goddess maibi to compose a dance form. Later, her dance form was reposessed by other goddesses.
Mythology.
Birth.
Sanamahi (Ashiba) was creating the earth. But he was frequently disturbed by his younger brother, Pakhangba (Haraba). Unable to do any work, Sanamahi complained about the matter to their father, Salailen (or Atingkok according to different versions of stories). Salailen produced a divine feminine being. He released her into the great space (void) of the universe (cosmos). In the vast emptiness of the great space (void), the divine feminine being became a beautiful and radiant goddess. She was named "Nongthang Leima", the Queen of Lightning.
In another version of the story, Sidaba ordered Sidabi to produce "Nongthang Leima", the divine female being to lure the destroyer from the cosmic creation.
Seduction (Attraction).
Nongthang Leima, the Queen of Lightning, filled the empty space (void) with bright light. Seeing her, Pakhangba (Haraba) fell in love with her. He forgot about bothering his elder brother in the creation of the earth. Haraba came to her in the great space. During that time, Sanamahi (Ashiba) completed his creation of the earth.
Family.
When Ashiba (Sanamahi) saw Nongthang Leima, he wanted to marry her. Thus, they united. 
So, Nongthang Leima was the wife of both Sanamahi (Ashiba) and Pakhangba (Haraba).
Nongthang Leima is also known as "Langmai Sana Chingjaroibi" (). With the union of Chingjaroibi and Sanamahi, a son named Laisang Khekwaiba was born.
Two divine forms.
According to "Politics, society, and cosmology in India's North East" written by N. Vijaylakshmi, the goddess Nongthang Leima (Nongthang Lairembi) took two divine forms after the completion of the creation of the earth. One form is Panthoibi. This form lives in the home of gods. Another form is "Apanthoibi". This form lives among the living beings.
Music.
Among the nine forms of musical rhythms ("Seisak"s) of Pena (musical instrument), Nongthang Leima Seisak is one. All these rhythms are categorised into three movements, slow rhythm, medium rhythm and fast rhythm. Nongthang Leima song belongs to the fast rhythm.
Festival.
During the Lai Haraoba festival, devotees dance to please various deities. Among them, male dancers act after the styles of Haraba (alias Pakhangba) and female dancers act after the styles of goddess Nongthang Leima. Goddess Nongthang Leima represents the lightning.

The peak-end rule is a psychological term proposed by and Daniel Kahneman. It suggests the following: When evaluating an experience, people do not recall details in every moment they experienced. People mainly recall what happened and how they felt at the peak and the end of the event. The peak is the time when they had the strongest emotion. Our feelings at the peak and the end of the event decide what people generally feel about an experience. The feelings at the peak and the end take up similar weights, which means the memory of the experience is the average of the two.
The peak-end rule is a form of . When evaluating past experiences, people concentrate on the peak and the end while other parts of the experience are neglected. How long they have had the experience, is neglected.
According to peak-end rule, humans use false memories to form preferences and make decisions. Thus, decisions are very unlikely to lead to the best outcome they want. By contrast, the standard economics suggests that humans can always choose something that serves them the best, producing the largest net pleasantness. The establishment of the theory is evidence against the rational choice theory.
First establishment and one scientific example.
The peak–end rule was first established by Daniel Kahneman and others in 1993. In the experiment, participants were divided into two groups. They had to undergo an unpleasant experience. Everything else was the same, except for one group who had to go through an extra, less unpleasant experience at the end. Let us call this group Group B and previous group Group A.
The researchers concluded that the most unpleasant, the peak, and the final intensity of unpleasantness, the end were used to evaluate the procedure. In this case, the end of Group B is less unpleasant. At the same time, the peak of both Group A and Group B were the same. Thus, the sum of the unpleasantness of the peak and the end was less for Group B. As a result, participants from Group B found the experience less unpleasant, although for both the duration of and the sum of unpleasantness, Group A &lt; Group B.
Explanations.
Why only the peak and the end?
The peak-end rule is a type of . The peak and the end simplify and represent the whole experience. It reduces people's and helps people make quick decisions.From an evolutionary point of view, emotion related memories help us survive, keep us safe. For example, fear related memories help us recognize and better deal with dangerous situations.
The peak is memorable.
When memory sticks, it lasts longer and can be recalled easier. Memories associated with strong emotions stick. Experiments were done to prove strong emotion-related things are recalled more often. An experiment done by found a biological explanation for this. 
The end is memorable.
Why our memory prefers what happened at the end can be explained by the recency effect. suggests that we consider recent events to be more important. What happens at the end of an experience is more recent to us. Thus, we consider the things that happen at the end of an experience to be more important. The end is more memorable than other parts.
Application.
How to leave a good impression.
Adding a positive peak can establish a good memory of an experience even though there may be unimportant unpleasant moments in between. This technique has been applied to many fields, for example, the business field. When customers are leaving, salesmen help the customer hold the door. This act leaves a good final and overall impression. Another example is in the educational field. To make receiving negative feedback more acceptable, ending with the most pleasant part of the feedback will help.
Become regulars.
People's memories of an experience influence their decision making. Adding a good end encourages people to experience the event a second time. Some medical procedures are too painful for the patients to repeat. Adding something positive at the end creates a more positive impression of the experience. After doing so, there is a smaller probability the patient is unwilling to receive the treatment a second time. Then, patients can more effectively recover with a less total cost and shorter time.
A negative end.
Inversely, a negative end ruins the memory of an experience even though everything before was perfect.If a person wants themselves or other people to do something less, adding a negative end to the experience helps.
Reflect on our own experiences.
People's memories of their experiences are not what they experienced. So, relying on our memories to make decisions does not lead to the highest net pleasure. To experience the net largest amount of pleasure, people should spend as much time as possible on things that they are unwilling to stop doing.
Restrictions and criticisms.
Studies found that other factors influence the peak-end rule. Firstly, the expectation. A high expectation is compared with the actual experience at the start. If a difference exists, the starting experience will be the most important factor in overall experience evaluation. The peak-end rule is more likely to be applicable to lower expectation situations. Secondly, one study finds that the effect of peak-end law is small on one day experiences. Moreover, some people are easily affected by the rule but others are not. Thirdly, according to and Carmon, how we feel at the moment of evaluation also affects the outcome.

Henderson Island is an uninhabited island in the south Pacific Ocean. The island was also called San Juan Bautista and Elizabeth Island in the past. With Pitcairn, Oeno and Ducie Islands it forms the Pitcairn Island Group.
It is one of the world's last two raised coral atolls whose ecosystems remain relatively unaffected by human contact. A 2017 survey found a large amount of plastic debris on its beaches. Ten of its 51 flowering plants, all four of its land birds and about a third of the identified insects and gastropods are endemic – a remarkable diversity given the island's size.
The island is small: it measures by . It has an area of . It is located northeast of Pitcairn Island. It has poor soil and little fresh water. This makes it unsuitable for agriculture. There are three beaches on the northern end. The rest of the coast is made of steep cliffs up to in height.
In 1902 Henderson was added to the Pitcairn Islands colony. The Pitcairn Islands are a South Pacific British Overseas Territory. United Nations made it a World Heritage Site in 1988. 
History.
Archaeological evidence suggests that a small permanent Polynesian settlement existed on Henderson at some time between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries. The reasons, why the group disappeared from the island are unknown. At about the same time, Polynesians also left Pitcairn Island. The group on Henderson would have depended on the group on Pitcairn for many things of daily life; there's no stone suitable for making tools on Henderson. The Pitcairn Polynesians may in turn have disappeared because of the decline of nearby Mangareva; Henderson was at the end of a chain of small, dependent colonies of Mangareva.
On 29 January 1606, Portuguese captain Pedro Fernandes de Queirós, was the first European to see the island, and named it "San Juan Bautista". He was leading a Spanish expedition at the time. Captain Henderson of the British East India Company ship "Hercules" rediscovered the island on 17 January 1819. Thomas Raine (1793-1860), master of the ship "Surry" of London, had called it "Henderson's Island" as it appeared to him from the conversation he had with James Henderson at Valparaiso to be his discovery on his last voyage to India from that port in the ship "Hercules". On 2 March 1819, Captain Henry King, in the "Elizabeth", landed on the island to find the king's colors already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship into a tree.
A sperm whale rammed and sank the Nantucket whaleship Essex on 20 November 1820. The crew arrived at Henderson on 20 December in three small whaleboats. They found the island's only known drinkable water-source – a brackish spring on the north shore, exposed at half tide – and ate fish, birds, eggs, crabs and peppergrass, but they had largely exhausted the available food within a week. On 27 December the three boats set sail for South America, leaving behind Thomas Chappel, Seth Weeks, and William Wright, who chose to stay. They survived until their rescue on 9 April 1821. In his account of the ordeal, Chappel reported having seen human skeletons in a cave. The report of sperm whale ramming the ship may have inspired Herman Melville to write "Moby-Dick"
In August 1851, visitors from Pitcairn Island also found skeletons in a cave and wreckage on the beach next to the cave. After a party of Pitcairn Islanders collecting miro wood rediscovered the skeletons in March 1958, a medical examination determined that the bones were of Caucasian origin, and they were then buried in a shallow grave inside the cave. An American survey team examined the bones in 1966 and buried them in five coffins in the left-hand corner of the cave, tightly jamming a large cross between the ceiling and the rock floor at the entrance. They concluded the remains were of five or six people, one of whom was between three and five years of age. It was presumed they were the survivors of a shipwreck who died of dehydration.
A final examination in the context of a scientific expedition in 1991 concluded that the human remains on Henderson Island were prehistoric Polynesians.
In 1902, Henderson Island, along with Oeno and Ducie islands, was formally annexed to the British Empire by Captain G. F. Jones, who visited the islands in a cutter with a crew of Pitcairn Islanders. In August 1937, HMS Leander, on a journey from Europe to New Zealand, carried out an aerial survey of Henderson, Oeno and Ducie, and on each island, a British flag was planted and an inscription was nailed up proclaiming: "This island belongs to H.B.M. King George VI." 
In 1957, a 27-year-old American, Robert Tomarchin, lived the life of a castaway on the island for approximately 2 months, accompanied by a pet chimpanzee, apparently as a publicity stunt, until people from Pitcairn rescued him in two longboats.
In the early 1980s, conservative American businessman Arthur "Smiley" Ratliff expressed interest in establishing a mansion for himself on the island, with an airstrip. The Pitcairn Island Council approved his plans but, after environmentalists lobbied to protect the natural ecology and environment of the island, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office overrode the decision and vetoed the proposed development. Henderson Island was listed as a World Heritage Site in 1988.
Natural resources.
Since the introduction of aluminum-hulled long-boats in the 20th century, Pitcairners have made regular trips to Henderson to harvest the wood of "miro" and tou trees. Usually, they go to Henderson once per year, but they may make up to three trips if the weather is favourable. Pitcairners carve the wood into curios for tourists, from which they get much of their income.
Geography.
Henderson Island is a raised coral atoll. With Pitcairn, Ducie and Oeno islands, forms the Pitcairn Island Group. The nearest major landmass is more than away. This coral limestone island sits atop a conical (presumed volcanic) mound, rising from a depth of roughly . Its surface is mostly reef-rubble and dissected limestone. Except for the north end, the island is encircled by steep limestone cliffs up to high.
There are three main beaches, on the northwest, north, and northeast shores. The north and northwest beaches are on the border of reefs. The depression at the island's center is thought to be a raised lagoon. There is only one known source of drinking water on the island: a brackish spring on the north shore exposed at half tide, rising from a crevice in flat rock, large surfaces of which compose the face of the beach. The surrounding ocean tidal range is about one meter at spring tide.
Flora.
Apart from five species bordering the beaches, including coconut palms, the vegetation is undisturbed. Henderson Island is covered by 5–10 m tall tangled scrub forest. There is less forest in the central depression. It has 51 native species of flowering plants, ten of which are unique to the island (endemic). Dominant tree species include coconut palms, "Pandanus tectorius"," Thespesia populnea" (miro), "Tournefortia argentea", "Cordia subcordata" (tou), "Guettarda speciosa", "Pisonia grandis", "Geniostoma hendersonense", "Nesoluma st.-johnianum", "Hernandia stokesii", "Myrsine hosakae", and "Celtis sp."
Fauna.
Birds.
The island is presently home to four endemic land bird species – the Henderson fruit dove, Henderson lorikeet, Henderson reed warbler and the flightless Henderson crake. Three species of the family Columbidae were formerly endemic to the island. They became extinct when the Polynesians arrived around 1000 CE. Of the fifteen non-endemic seabird species found, nine or more probably breed on the island. Breeding colonies of the globally endangered Henderson petrel formerly existed on Ducie but were wiped out by invasive rats by 1922. It is believed to now nest uniquely on Henderson island.
Bones of birds have been found near the prehistoric settlements. These settlements existed 500 to 800 years ago. The bones found include those of two species of bird that still visit the island, but do not nest there: The Christmas shearwater and red-footed booby. There are alos bones of four bird species that can no longer be found on the island at all. Polynesian settlers may have driven these bird species, along with six terrestrial snail species to extinction on the island. This loss of a ready and regular food supply may have contributed to the Polynesians' disappearance. The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area for its endemic landbirds and breeding seabirds.
Other animals.
The invertebrate species are largely unknown but a third of the island's known non-marine gastropods and insects are endemic. There are no native mammals but the Pacific rat, introduced by Polynesians 800 years ago, abounds. A skink and the green sea turtle have been identified, and an unidentified gecko has been reported. There are also crabs.
Biological risk.
Land bird populations appear to be relatively stable. The big problem is that when yachts land on the island without authorization, they introduce new predators, disease vectors or diseases. Introduction of the Eurasian black rat or the domestic cat would be likely to cause almost immediate extinction of the ground-dwelling Henderson crake and possibly other species. The endemic birds may have no immunity to the fatal avian pox which is transmitted by biting flies.
Between July and November 2011 a partnership of the Pitcairn Islands Government and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds started a program to eradicate the Pacific rat using poison. The program was very successful. Before the program, between 50.000 and 100.000 rats lived on the island. The poison killed almost all of them. Between 60 and 80 rats survived and the population has now fully recovered.
Plastic debris.
Research published in April 2017 looked at debris on several beaches, and reported "the highest density of plastic rubbish anywhere in the world" as a result of the South Pacific Gyre. The beaches contain an estimated 37.7 million items of debris. There weight is estimated at 17.6 tonnes. When a study was done on North Beach, each day 17 to 268 new items washed up on a 10-meter section of the beach. The study noted that purple hermit crabs make their homes in plastic containers washed up on beaches; the debris may reduce shoreline gastropod diversity, may contribute to a reduction in the number of sea turtle laying attempts and may increase the risk of entanglement for coastal-nesting seabirds.

Prosperity theology is a religious belief that if the believer is wealthy and in good health, this is always the will of God. It is most common among certain groups of Protestant Christians. It is also known as prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, the gospel of success, or seed faith. These groups also believe that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology sees the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity.
The doctrine says that it is God's will for his people to be blessed. The atonement is interpreted to include the healing of sickness and lessening of poverty. Both are curses that can be broken by faith. This is believed to be achieved through donations of money, visualization, and positive confession.
Groups in favor of prosperity theology started in the United States in the 1950s. The origins may go back to a movement callled New Thought, which started in the 19th century. The basic ideas were important for another movement, called Word of Faith. In the 1980s televangelism was sometimes successful because of these ideas. In the 1990s and 2000s, prosperity theology was adopted by influential leaders in the Pentecostal Movement and Charismatic Movement in the United States and has spread throughout the world. Prominent leaders in the development of prosperity theology include E. W. Kenyon, Oral Roberts, A. A. Allen, Robert Tilton, T. L. Osborn, Joel Osteen, Creflo Dollar,[8] Kenneth Copeland, Reverend Ike, and Kenneth Hagin. 
Leaders from other Christian novements have critiziced prosperity theology: They say that it is irresponsible, promotes idolatry, and is contrary to scripture. Secular as well as some Christian observers have also criticized prosperity theology: They say it exploits the poor. The practices of some preachers have attracted scandal and some have been charged with financial fraud.

The Kumeyaay are a group of people native to the United States and Mexico. They live in the places now known as California (specifically San Diego and the surrounding regions) and Baja California.
There are two groups of Kumeyaay, the Ipai and the Tipai. Ipai land is in what is now the United States while Tipai land is mostly in what is now Mexico.
Name.
The word Kumeyaay is pronouned KOOM-yai. The KOOM part rhymes with loom and the yai part rhymes with pie. Some people pronounce Kumeyaay in three syllables and add an extra "uh" between KOOM and yai.
The Kumeyaay were also called Diegueño, which is a Spanish word that comes from Mission San Diego. However, this is not the name they call themselves.
The two different groups of Kumeyaay are called Ipai (EE-pie) and Tipai (TEE-pie). They both mean "human" in the Ipai and Tipai languages.
Language.
The Kumeyaay speak three languages. They are Tipai, Ipai, and Kumeyaay. Now, most of them speak English and Spanish.
History.
In the 1760s, the Spanish came onto Kumeyaay land. They wanted to teach the Kumeyaay about the Christian religion and the European lifestyle. To do that, they built the Mission San Diego, which was a church, a school, and a village.all in one. However, the Kumeyaay did not like being told what to do. In 1775, the Kumeyaay fought the Spanish at Mission San Diego. They set some buildings on fire and killed a priest.
When the Kumeyaay land became part of Mexico, there was no one to send money to the missions to keep them running so the Kumeyaay left.
When part of Kumeyaay land became part of the United States, the Kumeyaay were sent to live on certain pieces of land called reservations. Many of these reservations now have casinos so that the Kumeyaay people can make money.
Religion.
Most Kumeyaay are now Catholic. Many parts of their old religion were forgotten when they became Catholic. However, they still remember some parts.
In the traditional Kumeyaay religion, a dead person's soul must cross a deep gorge in order to get to heaven.

Charles Entertainment "Chuck E." Cheese is the anthropomorphic rat mascot of the Chuck E. Cheese chain of family entertainment centers. In 2012, the rat mascot was rebranded into a mouse.
Pizza Time Theatre era.
The character was first created as the mascot for a restaurant made by Nolan Bushnell (founder of Atari) in 1977. Bushnell went to the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) conference in Orlando and saw walk-around character costumes being sold. In them, Bushnell found one that looked like a coyote, so he bought it for his planned Coyote Pizza restaurant. When the costume arrived at Atari, the costume was actually a rat, with a long pink rat tail. Bushnell decided to change the restaurant's name to Rick Rat's Pizza. However, Bushnell's planning group thought that a rat for the name of a restaurant would not be appropriate. Finally, Bushnell's group decided on the name Chuck E. Cheese for the mascot and changed the restaurant's name to Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre. The first Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre opened in San Jose, California, in the same year Chuck E. Cheese was made, 1977.
Chuck E. Cheese's era: 1995-present.
In 1995, the mascot was given a more child-friendly makeover, with wider cheeks, a less pointy, shorter snout, longer eyes and smaller ears. This one was added to the restaurants in 2001.
In July 2012, the mascot was changed into a much smaller kind of the character, who played electric guitar. Voice actor Duncan Brannan, who for 19 years had made Chuck E. Cheese a wise-cracking mouse from New Jersey, was replaced with Jaret Reddick, the frontman and guitarist for the pop punk band Bowling for Soup.

Edward Norton Lorenz (May 23, 1917 – April 16, 2008) was an American mathematician and meteorologist. He was one of the first to work in the field of Chaos theory. He was the first to use the term Butterfly effect for dynamic systems that are very sensitive to starting conditions. In the 1960s, he used a simple model for weather prediction, which he simialated on a computer. With this setup, he discovered that only a slight change of the values he used for the model could lead to totally different results. This is known as Butterfly effect. In numerical weather predicion, values are often rounded, so that in each step, a small error is added.
He also discovered and developed the mathematical foundations. For his simulations he used a system of equations, which is now named after him.

Love Thy Neighbour is a British TV comedy series that first aired on UK TV between April, 1972 - January, 1976. It centres on a white working class couple (Eddie and Joan Booth) and their black, Conservative-voting neighbours (Bill and Barbie Reynolds). The programme spans eight series and 53 episodes, including a pilot episode. 
The ongoing racial conflict between the husbands of the two couples is the main underlying theme of the programme, with the white husband perceived as more bigoted and ignorant. Their wives are seen as more tolerant. A spin-off film with the same name was made in 1973 and later a sequel series was set in Australia, featuring only the Eddie Booth character. The series was produced by Thames TV for the ITV network.
Story.
Eddie Booth (Jack Smethhurst) is a working-class white socialist. His world changes when Bill and Barbie Reynolds move in next door. He is a bigoted person and his racial slurs are aimed mainly at Bill. He often describes Bill as a "nig nog", "Sambo" and '"King Kong". He also has a tendency to call Chinese, Pakistanis or Indians names like "Fu Manchu", "Gunga Din" and "Ali Baba". He often asserts that all blacks (and Bill in particular) are cannibals and claims that "the white man always takes precedence over the black man".
Joan Booth (Kate Williams) is Eddie's wife. She is more tolerant towards her neighbours. In fact, she gets very on well with Barbie, Bill's wife, and they are often seen together discussing the animosities between their husbands.
Bill Reynolds (Rudolph Walker) is a supporter of West Ham United. Whenever Eddie tries to outdo him, Bill usually ends up having the last laugh and rarely gets his comeuppance. He tends to have a very short temper, especially where Eddie's concerned and has threatened him with a clenched fist several times. Although more sophisticated and educated compared to Eddie, Bill is also stubborn and is more than capable of using insulting phrases as he occasionally refers to Eddie as a "white honky" and "snowflake", and does not like catching Eddie staring at his wife. He also has a very high-pitched laugh. Bill was promoted to foreman at the end of the episode "Clarky Leaves". His catchphrases include "Hey, honky!", "Cobblers!" and "You talking to me, snowflake?".
Barbie Reynolds (Nina Baden-Semper) is Bill's wife. Barbie and her next-door neighbour, Joan Booth, instantly strike up a friendship that carries on throughout the series, and the two women are often seen drinking tea or eating or getting caught up in their antagonistic husbands' latest row. Eddie is sometimes fascinated by her, as in the pilot episode when she bends over while wearing hot pants. She and Joan both become pregnant at the end of Series 3, with Barbie giving birth to a son, Terry. Unlike other characters, she does not have any catchphrases.
Other main cast members are Jacko Robinson (Keith Marsh) and Arthur Thomas (Tommy Godfrey) who are often seen with Eddie and Bill in their local bar. Jacko's catchphrase "I'll 'ave half", meaning a half of bitter, became a popular catchphrase.

The revealed frog, orange-thighed tree frog or whirring tree frog ("Litoria revelata") is a frog from Australia. It is related to the brown tree frog. It lives in three different places in Queensland and New South Wales, but scientists think the frogs living in different places might be different species.
The male frog is 26 to 28 mm long from nose to rear end. The female is 30 to 36 mm long.
This frog can live in swamps near the coast up to rainforests in the mountains. Scientists say people can tell whether a frog is a revealed frog by looking at it because it has much larger discs at the ends of its toes than other frogs do and because it sometimes has black spots on its middle. People can tell it apart from other frogs by listening to it because its voice is around 4 Hz. It has long legs and a stripe from its nose to each armpit. It is cream-brown or red-brown in colour. It may have orange on its legs.
Scientists knew this frog existed in at least the 1960s, but it was first formally described, meaning scientists wrote the first formal paper about it, in 1982.
It lays its eggs in still water.
This frog is not endangered but people do damage its habitat by removing trees and bringing cows there to eat the grass.

The M1 carbine is a short, lightweight semi-automatic rifle, or a carbine, used in the United States military from World War II until late in the Vietnam War. It was made to arm soldiers with less of a combat role and more of a support role, such as medics and radiomen. The kind of weapon the military wanted was a gun that would be more powerful and accurate than the M1911, but shorter and lighter than the M1 Garand. The M1 Garand was too long and heavy for support troops to carry, especially since combat was not their main job.
Even though the M1 carbine looks similar to the M1 Garand, the two guns are actually very different. First, the M1 carbines bullets, the .30 Carbine, are much smaller and lighter than the Garand's .30-06 bullets. Second, the gun itself is much lighter, smaller, and shorter range than the Garand. The M1 carbine weighs less than half of the Garand. Third, the M1 carbine is loaded with box magazines that holds 15 bullets, while the M1 Garand is loaded with clips that hold 8 bullets.
Even though it is not used by the military anymore, it is still popular with civilians.
The M2 carbine is a selective fire version of the M1, which means it can switch between semi-automatic and full automatic fire.

A stripper clip is speedloader used to load bullets into a rifle more quickly so that soldiers can fully load a rifle all at once, rather than to load bullets one at a time. It is mostly used for directly loading bolt-action rifles, but it can also load bullets into magazines as well. It is different from a magazine because the person loading the gun must push the bullets off of the clip into the firearm.

The Burmese alphabet is an alphabet that is used to write some languages, including the Burmese language. It is also used to write down the religious languages of Sanskrit and Pali. It is very different from the ABCs. It is known for having a lot of round letters that look like circles.
Some people in Burma use the Burmese alphabet to write their own languages, but add extra letters to represent the sounds unique to their own languages.
Burmese is written from left to right.
History.
Monks would write on palm leaves. They had to make the letters round because straight lines would split the leaf and ruin it. Eventually, these round letters became the Burmese alphabet as we know it today.
Letters.
The Burmese alphabet has 33 basic consonants. Extra marks are added to indicate vowels and tones.
Consonants.
There are 33 consonants in the Burmese alphabet. When they are alone, they have an "ah" sound, although people use the "uh" sound when another syllable follows it.
The Burmese alphabet is not organized the same way as the ABCs. Instead, consonants are organized by the parts of the mouth they are made in. For example, the first row of consonants are all sounds that are made when the tongue is against the back of the mouth.
Some letters are written different in different cases to avoid confusion with other letters. For example, � + � is written as �� (wah) to avoid confusion with � (t).
There are letters that are used in words from Pali. They are: � (gh), � (jh), � (ṭ), � (ṭh), � (ḍ), � (ḍh), � (ṇ), � (dh), and � (ḷ).
Two letters, � ("ś") and � ("ṣ"), are only used in words that are from Sanskrit. They are pronounced the same as �.
To make more consonants, special marks are written around or below consonants. These marks are: �, �, �, and �. They change the consonant sound. For example, � makes a y sound (like you) but � + � makes �� which makes a sh sound (like shoe). There are rules about which consonants can be changed this way.
Vowels.
Every letter has a "ah" sound when it's alone. For example, � is pronounced as "kah." When a lone letter is followed by another syllable, it is pronounced with a "uh" sound.
Special marks are written around the letters to show other vowels.
Tones.
Burmese is a tonal language. That means that the meaning of a word can change by how fast or slow someone let air out of their throats. In written Burmese, tones are indicated by special marks.
These marks are � (high tone) and � (creaky tone, but can only be used when an ending consonants is written down too).
Syllable rhymes.
Burmese words cannot end in a consonant sound. For example, "cat" would not be a word in Burmese because it has a "t" sound at the end. However, words are written with consonants to indicate special vowel sounds that are allowed at the end of Burmese words. These consonants have a special mark on them (�) called asat. When these consonants are combined with the vowels that are already written, they are called syllable rhymes.
Some of these special consonants indicate that the word needs to end with a puff of air, like in "uh-oh" between the uh and the oh. They are: ��, ��, ��, ��.
Other special sounds indicate that the vowels is nasal. Nasal vowels are not found in English, but are found in other languages like French and Portuguese. They are: ��, �� ��, ��, ��.
Stacking consonants.
In Burmese writing, consonants can be written on top of each other. There are very specific rules on which consonants can be stacked on top of which.

Kongonaphon is an early member of the dinosaur–pterosaur clade Ornithodira. It is a small reptile-type fossil found in the 
Middle to Late Triassic of Madagascar. It was probably an insectivore, based on the shape and texture of its teeth.
"Kongonaphon" is notable for its tiny size, even compared to other small early avemetatarsalia. The femur was only about 4 cm (1.6 inches) long, and the total height of the animal was about 10 cm (3.9 inches). 
It has long been thought that early members of the group were small. If they were as small as this, then a miniaturization event occurred near the base of the avian stem lineage. Also the small size explains the origin of body covering ("integument", hair on the body of dinosaurs and feathers on birds). Tiny creatures are most vulnerable to changes in external temperature.

Knuckle-walking is a way some land animals move. Knuckle-walking animals curl fingers or front toes like a fist and touch the ground using the bony part of the front foot, the knuckle. Gorillas, chimpanzees, anteaters and platypuses knuckle-walk. In general, animals knuckle walk if their hands or front paws have special shapes for doing something very different from walking. Apes use their hands to hold food and use tools, so they have fingers. They curl up their fingers when they knuckle-walk. Anteaters use their front paws to dig for ants, so they curl up their digging claws when they knuckle-walk. Platypuses use their front paws to swim, so they curl up their webbed toes when they knuckle-walk.
Large anteaters that walk on the ground, for example the giant anteater, knuckle-walk. Smaller anteaters that live in trees do not. Platypuses walk on their knuckles so that the webbing on their front feet will not get in the way.
Gorillas from the genus "Gorilla" and chimpanzees from the genus "Pan" both walk on their knuckles but not in the same way. Chimpanzees spend more time in trees than gorillas do, so they turn their wrists in many different ways. Gorillas usually keep their wrists straight when they knuckle-walk. Gorillas and chimpanzees knuckle-walk when they move on the ground because their bodies are adapted to move around in trees: their arms are longer than their legs, and their middles are cone-shaped. The bones in their arms are good for knuckle-walking: the radius can lock into one of the bones in the wrist so the two bones together can hold the animal's weight. Human arm and wrist bones do not do this.
Some fictional cavemen knuckle-walk or drag the knuckles of their long arms on the ground, but scientists do not agree on whether human beings evolved from ancestors who really knuckle-walked on the ground the way gorillas do.

Rest in power is a saying that is used to replace "rest in peace," which is said after someone dies. The phrase "rest in power" is used for people who have dedicated their lives to activism or those who have died due to oppression, such as racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. Using the term "rest in power" instead of "rest in peace" sends a message that the dead person cannot rest in peace until change occurs. "Rest in power" also means that the dead person is making changes in society despite being dead.
The phrase "rest in power" is used in progressive groups.
History.
"Rest in power" is a newer phrase. An early example of the phrase was published in an LA Weekly article about Latino gangs in East L.A. in 1989. 
Another use appeared in 2000 in honor of a graffiti artist in Oakland, California who was shot and killed.
By the mid-2000s, the phrase began to appear in print, again linked to young people's premature, violent deaths. In March 2003, under the headline "Rest In Power, Rachel Corrie", "In These Times" eulogised the death of activist Rachel Corrie at the hands of the Israeli military in Gaza. In a 2005 opinion piece in the "San Francisco Chronicle", Meredith Maran reflected on 19-year-old Meleia Willis-Starbuck, a Dartmouth College scholarship student who was home in Berkeley for the summer when she was shot and killed by an unknown assailant outside her apartment. Writing of the makeshift public altar set up to mourn Willis-Starbuck, Maran wrote, "I've never seen 'Rest in Power' written as a substitute for 'Rest in Peace.'"
A September 29, 2005 article in the "Ottawa Citizen", a Canadian newspaper, described a public graffiti memorial for teenage Ottawa murder victim Jennifer Teague that portrayed "a smiling Ms. Teague beneath the words, 'Rest in power'" and framed by "two black angels."
Black Lives Matter.
People who are part of Black Lives Matter use "Rest in power" to remember all Black people who died because of racism. Even though the phrase wasn't used yet during the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 60s, people still say "rest in power" when talking about people who died because of racism back then or were involved in the movement. For example, Emmett Till died in 1955, but people still say "rest in power" when they're talking about him.
When Trayvon Martin died, his parents used the phrase to honor him. They wrote a book called "Rest in Power" about his life.
Transphobia.
An American trans girl named Leelah Alcorn committed suicide in 2014, citing her inability to continue living with her parents' transphobia. After her death, her parents continued to refuse to recognize or respect her identity, and instead chose to use her deadname instead of her preferred name. People in queer online communities used "rest in power" to honor Leelah and her struggle for recognition and acceptance.

Deadnaming is using a name (called a "deadname") that a transgender person used before transitioning without their permission. It is called that because the person who that name belongs to is considered "dead" and is now a brand-new person. 
Sometimes, people deadname another person by accident. They may know the other person before they transitioned. Other times, people deadname other people on purpose. Using a person's deadname is considered to be very disrespectful because it ignores a person's gender identity and is a type of transphobia if it happens on purpose. Some people think that deadnaming is a form of violence.
Obstacles.
It is very hard for people to change their names on forms because there is a lot of paperwork involved. That means that they are more likely to experience deadnaming.

The Red Meadows () is a 1945 Danish World War II drama movie directed by Bodil Ipsen and Lau Lauritzen Jr. and based on the novel of the same name by Ole Valdemar Juul. It stars Poul Reichhardt, Lisbeth Movin, Per Buckhøj, Gyrd Løfqvist, Kjeld Jacobsen, Karl Jørgensen and distributed by ASA Film.

Leelah Alcorn was a transgender American girl. On December 28, 2014, she killed herself because her parents did not respect her gender identity. They made her learn lessons at home and forced her to go to conversion therapy in order to force her to accept her birth gender. After Alcorn died, many laws were made in order to stop discrimination against trans people.
Life.
Leelah Alcorn was born into a conservative Christian family. They lived in the U.S. state of Ohio.
In the United States, many conservative Christians do not like anything related to LGBT causes. They believe that boys will always be boys and girls will always be girls because they think that God made them that way. They also think that transgender people are "confused" and need to learn how to appreciate their birth gender. One way they do that is through conversion therapy. However, many studies have shown that this type of therapy does not work and hurts the people it is supposed to help.
Ever since she was 4, Alcorn felt like a "girl trapped in a boy's body." When she was 14, she identified as transgender. She told her mom that she was transgender. Her mom said that it was a "phase" and that she could never be a woman. This made her depressed, so her mom sent her to Christian therapists who also told her that she was a man and that she should "look to God for help." When Alcorn was still alive, conversion therapy was still legal in Ohio. Going to these therapists did not make her feel better.
When Alcorn was 16, she told other kids at school that she liked boys. Other kids at school accepted that she liked boys and were happy for her. However, her parents were not happy. They thought she was making the family name look bad. They made her go to an online school that taught Christian values. They did not allow her to use social media or a cell phone. Because of these rules, Alcorn felt very alone.
Death.
Before she died, Alcorn wrote a post on Tumblr. It said:
Alcorn asked for her belongings to be sold so that the money could go to support groups that work for trans rights. She signed the note as "(Leelah) Alcorn." "Josh" was the name her parents gave her at birth.
She also wrote another note and left it in her bedroom. It said, "I've had enough." Her parents threw it away after the police made a copy.
Alcorn walked onto a highway near her house and was hit by a truck.
The note got a lot of attention on Tumblr. However, her Tumblr blog disappeared after her parents asked Tumblr to delete it.
Alcorn's family had a private funeral. Her body was said to have been cremated.
In 2015, the Ohio State Patrol said that Alcorn's death was a suicide.
Reactions.
Many people were sad that Leelah Alcorn died and that she was treated badly by her parents. They thought that she was a victim of her parent's transphobia.
Leelah's parents.
Alcorn's parents were sad that she died. However, they refused to recognize her as transgender. In a Facebook post, Alcorn's mother Carla called her by her deadname, A lot of people thought that was disrespectful because "Josh" was not the name Alcorn wanted to be called. Some people sent mean messages to her mom on Facebook. Others said that her parents should go to jail and lose custody of their other kids. Carla Alcorn deleted the post.
Carla Alcorn went onto CNN and said that "we loved him unconditionally. We loved him no matter what. I loved my son. People need to know that I loved him. He was a good kid, a good boy." Some people said that their love was not "unconditional" because of their hostile reaction to Leelah when she told them she was trans.
Others.
Many people around the world talked about Alcorn's death. They made art and lit candles to honor her.
Many LGBT rights groups said that transgender suicide happened a lot because trans people are being treated badly, just like how Leelah was treated wrong. Besides the problem of suicide, trans people are often killed and treated wrong in other ways.
Some people tried to raise money to buy a gravestone with the name Leelah Alcorn on it to replace the gravestone with her birth name on it. However, this did not happen. Instead, a group bought a bench, tree, and plaque.
Leelah's Law.
A petition was made to ban conversion therapy in the United States. President Barack Obama said that he supported laws banning conversion therapy. 
In December of 2015, Cincinnati banned conversion therapy. As of July 2020, five cities in Ohio have banned conversion therapy and two others had banned it on minors.

Eat the Rich is a phrase. Attributed to French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau The direct phrase in his original language is: "Quand les pauvres n'auront plus rien à manger, ils mangeront les riches!" (When the poor have nothing more to eat, they will eat the rich!).
This saying is used by people who are anti-capitalist to show their disapproval of Capitalism whos wealth is built on the exploitation of the people - literally to starvation. It is a warning to the rich who would build their wealth at the expense of everyone else, as the poor will unite in arms to take their heads ("eat" here not being used literally to mean cannibalism). Today it is a battlecry or slogan to rally the working class against those that would exploit them. This phrase was used more at the beginning of the 21st century because of increasing income inequality.
Pop culture.
The phrase Eat the Rich is used in pop culture. It expresses rebellion against the wealthy and powerful.

Big Five is the name colloquially given to the five largest banks that dominate the banking industry of Canada. All five banks are operationally based in Toronto. All five banks are classified as Schedule I banks that are domestic banks operating in Canada under government charter. The banks' shares are widely held, with any entity allowed to hold a maximum of twenty percent.
The Big Five are among the world's strongest banks, with Toronto-Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank, Bank of Montreal &amp; Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce at 11th, 15th, 21st, 28th &amp; 29th place, respectively.
In modern history, Royal Bank has always been the largest by a significant margin, although TD Bank has overtaken RBC in recent years. Up to the late 1990s, CIBC was the second largest, followed by Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank, and TD Bank. During the late 1990s and beyond, this ranking changed due to several reorganizations. Royal Bank acquired Royal Trust in 1993, while Scotiabank purchased National Trust in 1997. As Scotiabank found no merger partners among the other banks in the big five group, it instead expanded its international operations and passed the Bank of Montreal in size. TD Bank merged with Canada Trust, which was for a long time the largest trust in Canada, thus vaulting TD into the number one spot. There has been no major changes to Bank of Montreal. CIBC's first unsuccessful foray into the US market led it to shed its assets there, dropping it to the number five spot.

The custom was expanded to include a community's oldest women in 1930. Many towns in New England still carry on the "Boston Post" cane tradition with the original canes they were awarded in 1909. When a recipient dies (or leaves the community), the cane passes to a successor who is the town's next oldest living resident.

"Rock Me" is a song by One Direction from their second album "Take Me Home". The song was written by Peter Svensson, Sam Hollander, Lukasz Gottwald, Henry Walter, and Allan Grigg and was produced by Dr. Luke, Cirkut, and Kool Kojak. The song has a mid-tempo beat and a clapping riff reminiscent of "We Will Rock You" by Queen. The song received mixed reviews from critics, some of whom criticized its lyrics and others of whom praised its rock elements and production. "Rock Me" appeared on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 chart. 
Background.
"Rock Me" was written in one day by guitar player Peter Svensson of the Swedish band the Cardigans, Sam Hollander, and Allan 'Kool Kojak' Grigg for One Direction's second album "Take Me Home", which was released in November 2012. Grigg began by making a mid-tempo beat. Svensson has said that Hollander "had an idea for a title that's like 'rock me' instead of ‘rock you,’ and the melody just came." Lukasz 'Dr. Luke' Gottwald and Henry 'Cirkut' Walter co-produced the song.
Music and lyrics.
"Rock Me" is a mid-tempo pop rock song. Both "Billboard" and BBC Music said that the song was a departure from One Direction's signature bubblegum pop sound. One Direction's members’ voice ranges on the song span from F4 to C6. The instrumentals feature guitar strings and piano lines. The song is in the key of Ab major, the time signature is common time, and the tempo is a moderate 84 beats per minute. 
Critics have also remarked that the song has beat and clapping riff similar to those in Queen's "We Will Rock You". The lyrics have a nostalgic message about a former significant other and a double entendre for sexual intercourse. Regarding the double entendre, Grigg noted, "but at the same time, there's a vulnerability in it that's, like, so sweet for girls. It's a little self-deprecating. There's not a lot of overt machismo in the song.” "I approached it like high school," said Hollander, who wrote lyrics for "Rock Me": "On the first record, they were freshmen, innocent and wide-eyed. Now it's sophomore year, there are parties and driver’s licenses, and the world is theirs for the taking. That's what I wanted to capture."
Critical reception.
Alexis Petridis of "The Guardian" criticized the song as “excruciating” and called the lyrics tedious and uninspiring. "The New Zealand Herald" writer Lydia Jenkin deemed "Rock Me" one of "the most banal songs ever written," but noted that the group "know what teenage girls want to hear." Idolator critic Sam Lansky praised the track as "irresistible" and commended its sonic palette as "explosively punchy." Writing for HitFix, Melinda Newman favored its "nearly hypnotic anthemic" beat, and noted that "Rock Me" seemed perfectly tailored to become a live staple. Ben Rayner of the "Toronto Star" thought the song's Queen references were “clever” and “show[ed] that One Direction’s puppeteers aren't totally operating on autopilot." Robert Copsey from Digital Spy opined that the song's "simple-yet-genius catchiness" was its strongest attribute. "Billboard" reviewer Chris Payne applauded its rock elements, regarding it as a “welcome” deviation from the rest of "Take Me Home"'s bubblegum pop sound.
Chart performance.
During the week of November 18, 2012, "Rock Me" debuted at number one on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart due to very high digital download sales. As a result of an "end-of-year download rush" in the week ending December 30, 2012, the track made it onto the US "Billboard" Hot 100 at number 98, which was its peak position on the chart. 

Watson is an artificially intelligent computer system that can answer questions asked in a natural language. It was made by IBM to compete on the American television game show "Jeopardy!". In February 2011, Watson played as a contestant on "Jeopardy!" against past champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. Watson won the first place prize of $1 million. It was named after Thomas J. Watson, who was the chairman and chief executive officer of IBM from 1914 to 1956.
During a game, Watson had access to 200 million pages of content, including the full text of Wikipedia. Sources of information for Watson included encyclopedias, dictionaries, thesauri, news articles, and books. It was not connected to the internet, meaning that it had to use what was in its system to answer clues. For each clue, Watson's three most likely responses were displayed on the television screen along with its amount of confidence in those answers. If its confidence in a response was high enough, it would ring in to give the response.
After "Jeopardy!", Watson continued to be part of IBM's research in artificial intelligence. On new problems such as medical records and genetics, Watson technology was unable to compete with new methods such as deep learning.

A dog's coat is the hair covering its body. A dog can have a "double coat" that has short, soft hair underneath a layer of long, coarse hair, or a "single coat" that has only the long, coarse hair. A dog's coat may also be called hair or fur.
Four main coat attributes.
Dog coats can come in many different colors, patterns, lengths, and textures.
Coat colors.
Dog coats come in four main colors: black, brown, white, and red. The same main color can have many shades. These shades are sometimes common enough that they are given their own color names, such as gold, yellow, cream, blue, and grey.
There may be several of these colors on one dog.
Coat patterns.
Dog coats can also have many different patterns based on spots, patches, and mixing colors.
Coat lengths and textures.
A dog's coat can be long or short. For most dogs, their hair reaches one length and then stops growing, but there are some dogs whose hair will keep growing longer and longer.
Some breeds of dog do not grow hair on parts of their bodies. These dogs are called "hairless". Examples of "hairless" dogs are the Xoloitzcuintli (Mexican Hairless Dog), the Peruvian Inca Orchid (Peruvian Hairless Dog) and the Chinese Crested.

Orpheus is a hero in Greek mythology. When he played his lyre the world would sway to the music. It was noted he could charm mortals, Gods and even stones with his music. He was the son of a Muse. He was a companion of Jason and the Argonauts.
Orpheus was married to a dryad named Eurydice. In one version of the myth, while trying to get away from a satyr Eurydice was bitten by a snake and went to Hades. Orpheus rode the ferry across the river Styx to bring her back from the underworld. He played his lyre to make Cerberus fall asleep, and moved the wife of Hades, Persephone, with his music. She said he could take Eurydice back to the upper world if he didn't look back at Eurydice until they both got back up to the land of mortals. Racked by doubt, he did look back just before reaching the upper world, and so she was returned to the realm of Hades forever. He was killed by a group of Maenads when they became tired of his mournful music over Eurydice, and his head was cast into the sea.

In geology, permafrost is soil that stays frozen all year. To be called permafrost, soil must stay at or below for two or more years. Permafrost is also called cryotic soil.

Channel drift, also called network decay, is when a television channel moves away from its original shows to get a new audience, or to get higher ratings. It often involves a move from shows aimed at viewers that know a lot about the channel's subject to shows aimed at a wider audience. Most examples of channel drift have a channel add infotainment or reality shows to their schedule.
A well-known example of channel drift is MTV. When it started in 1981, MTV was a channel that showed music videos. In the 1990s, it started adding entertainment and reality shows aimed at a young adult audience. This was the start of a move towards the channel's current focus on shows aimed at adolescents and young adults.

Angela Yvonne Davis (born January 26, 1944 in Birmingham, Alabama) is an African American political activist and author. She first became famous because she was a prominent member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) and was involved in Black Power movements in the 1960s and 1970s. Since then she has become known for her work as a writer and speaker while teaching at the University of California. She has done research in the areas of feminism and critical theory and is a prison abolitionist.
Davis grew up in Alabama, then went to college at Brandeis University and University of California, San Diego. She was involved in activism from her youth. After becoming a Doctor of Philosophy in Germany, she returned to the US and began teaching as a professor. In 1969, she was fired from teaching for being a member of the Communist Party. A judge decided it was an illegal firing and the school eventually hired her back.
In 1970 she was put in prison by FBI agents. Some black revolutionaries tried to break their allies out of prison by kidnapping a white judge and some jurors in Marin County, but the police didn't let them get away and the revolutionaries and judge were shot to death. The FBI suspected that she bought the gun one of the revolutionaries used and decided to accuse her of the murder of the judge. In 1971 she appeared at the Marin County Superior Court and said, "I now declare publicly before the court, before the people of this country that I am innocent of all charges which have been leveled against me by the state of California." She was released from jail in 1972. Ronald Reagan said that she should never be allowed to teach at a California university. The English rock band The Rolling Stones recorded a song called "Sweet Black Angel" that was on their 1972 album "Exile on Main St." and dedicated to Davis.
In the 1990s, she left the Communist Party and began to focus her activism on prisons. She gave a speech in 1997 called "The Prison Industrial Complex". In it she said "prisons are becoming an integral part of the US economy." She said that fear of young people of color was being exploited to create a fast-growing industry, the prison-industrial complex (PIC). She created a prison abolitionist group called Critical Resistance in the same year. She wants there to be no prisons or police because she believes that the US prison system is more like a new form of slavery than a criminal justice system.
Since she started focusing on prisons, she has also supported Democrats like Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden in presidential elections.
Davis is Distinguished Professor Emerita at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
She was married to Hilton Braithwaite in the 1980s.

Little Iodine was a popular comic strip published in the United States on Sundays. It was created by Jimmy Hatlo. It was published from 1943 until 1985.
The story is about a girl called "Little Iodine". She first appeared in an earlier comic strip by Hatlo, called "They'll Do It Every Time". She was the daughter of the strip's main character, Henry Tremblechin. She constantly annoyed her father with pranks and practical jokes. The character of Iodine became very popular, so Hatlo promoted the character into her own strip in 1943.
Iodine's antics were on the Sunday comics page for over forty years. It came before "Dennis the Menace". From 1943 to 1963, "Little Iodine" was written and drawn by Hatlo.
Movie adaptations.
A movie based on the comic strip was released in 1946. It was by Comet Productions. The 56-minute movie stars Jo Ann Marlowe as Little Iodine, Hobart Cavanaugh as her father Henry, and Irene Ryan as her mother Cora.
In the movie, Iodine thinks that her mother is having an affair with Professor Simkins (played by Leon Belasco). She tries one antic after another to break up the couple. Her efforts backfire when they cause conflict between her father and his employer, Mr. Bigdome (Emory Parnell).
The movie was planned to be released earlier than October 20, 1946 (its actual distribution date), but that date was delayed due to an epidemic of polio that prevented children across the United States from attending movies. The movie is believed to be lost.

A Transistor radio is a radio receiver which uses transistors to amplify the sound. Transistor radios can be cheap and small and some use very little electric power. Some can amplify the weak radio waves that are usually not picked up by weaker vacuum tube radios. Transistor radio broadcasting receivers for portable use were sold in great numbers starting in the late 1950s. Soon, vacuum tube radios became rare.

Jewish ethics refers to the philosophical tradition of ethics in Judaism. 
Like other types of laws and values in other religions, the subject of Jewish ethics tries to provide answers for many moral questions. It has gone through major changes over the past 2000 years. The halakha addresses many problems that are related to all kinds of ethics.

The Jewish belief of Jews as a chosen people is that Jews are the chosen people of God. Some Jews believe that God has given them a special job to repair the world and make it a better place. According to this view, they must use the things in the world to increase good and come closer to God, and as God’s partner in repairing the world – to find ways to lessen suffering of people and animals, to make more peace and respect between people, and to protect the earth’s environment from destruction. This process is known as “"tikkun olam"” (from Hebrew) – repairing the world. 
From the Bible.
This origin of the idea in the Torah (the first five books of the Tanakh, which are also included in the Christian Bible). Much is written about these topics in rabbinic literature:
According to Judaism, God made an agreement called a “covenant” with Abraham, the ancestor of the Jewish people. The Bible says that God promised to bless Abraham and his descendants if they worshipped God and were faithful to him. God made this covenant with Abraham's son, Isaac, and with Isaac's son, Jacob. God also gave Jacob another name – Israel. This is how Jacob’s descendants got the name the “Children of Israel” or “Israelites.” The Jewish religion, God later gave the Israelites the Torah to the Israelites through their leader, Moses. The Torah told the Israelites how to live and build their community. God gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments and other laws in the Torah.
Interpretations.
Religious Jewish views.
The Jews are sometimes called the “Chosen People" because the Bible says God told them “you will be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (Exodus 19:6) and “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God, and the Lord chose you to be His own special nation out of all peoples on the earth” (Deuteronomy 14:2). Religious Jews ("orthodox") understand this means that they have special duties and responsibilities commanded by God - for example, that they must build a just society and serve only God. They believe that this covenant works in two ways: if they follow God’s laws, He will give them his love and protection, but they are also responsible for their sins – bad actions – and not doing what God told them. Religious Jews believe that they must teach other people that God exists and that God wants all people to do good actions. Jews believe that their job in the world is to be "a light to the nations" (Isiah 49:6) by showing the people of the world ways to make the world a better place.
Modern views.
The idea of chosenness has traditionally been interpreted by Jews in two ways: one way is that God chose the Israelites, while the other is that the Israelites chose God. Another opinion is that even though the Jews chose to follow God, the Kabbalah and Tanya teach that even prior to creation, the "Jewish soul" was already chosen. However, Jews do not believe that being a member of the Chosen People gives them any special talents or makes them better than anyone else, and many of whose who are considered "Jewish" (especially secular/(non-religious ones) do not believe they are "Chosen" in any way at all. 
Jews generally do not try to convince other people to believe in Judaism. Jews believe they have a special job to show all peoples that God exists, but people do not have to be Jewish to follow God. All people can serve God by following the Seven Commandments (rules) given to Noah. But, Judaism accepts people who choose to change their religion to Judaism. 
From other religions.
The Jewish people have a special status in the Islamic book, the Quran:
O children of Israel, remember my favor which I bestowed upon you, and that I favored you above all creation. (Qur'an 2:47). 2:122).
Many Christians also believe that the Jews were God's chosen people (), but because of Jewish rejection of Jesus, the Christians in turn received that special status (). This doctrine is known as Supersessionism.

The crest, in some cases called a crown, of a bird, is a group of feathers that some species of birds have on top of the head. The feathers of these crests can move up and down or be permanently up, depending of the species. For example, the crests of cockatoos and the hoopoe could be up or down but the feathers in the crest of the grey crowned crane are always up.
Crests on birds are generally used for display purposes. Birds with crests often use them to communicate with others and as a part of their courtship. They also tend to display their crests when they are frightened or ready to fight because the birds may appear larger than they really are.
Cockatoos and their smaller cousins, cockatiels, are part of the Cacatuidae family of parrots found in Australia, the Bismarck Archipelago and the Philippines, and are probably the most recognizable birds to feature crests. Cockatoos and cockatiels possess crests which may be raised or lowered at will. Their crests are used to communicate with fellow members of their species, or as a form of defense to frighten away other species that approach too closely, making the bird appear larger when the crest is suddenly and unexpectedly raised.

Theory of the Earth was a publication by James Hutton which laid the foundations for geology. In it he showed that the Earth is the product of natural forces. What could be seen happening today, over long periods of time, could produce what we see in the rocks. This idea, uniformitarianism, was a major step in the History of the geologic time scale. It was used by Charles Lyell in his work, and Lyell's textbook was an important influence on Charles Darwin.
Hutton recognized that rocks record the evidence of the past action of processes which still operate today. He also anticipated natural selection, as follows:
Hutton's prose hindered his theories. John Playfair in 1802 restated of Huttton's geological ideas in clearer English. However, he left out Hutton's thoughts on evolution. Charles Lyell in the 1830s popularised the idea of an infinitely repeating cycle (of the erosion of rocks and the building up of sediment). Lyell believed in gradual change, and thought even Hutton gave too much credit to catastrophic changes.
Hutton's work was published in different forms and stages:

The accusative case is the grammatical case which marks the direct object of a transitive verb. This is best explained with examples:
Forms.
In the sentence ""He" sees the woman", "he" is the subject of the sentence. In the sentence "The woman sees "him"", "him" is the object. 
English.
So, in English we use different forms of the pronoun: he/him. "Him" would be the accusative case. If we use a noun, there is no difference in English. We use the same word "man": The man sees the woman" and "The woman sees the man. 
In many languages different forms of the word are used, depending on what function it has in the sentence - subject or object. 
Latin.
For example, in Latin. "The man sees the woman" = "Vir feminam videt", while "The woman sees the man" = "Femina virum videt". For "man", Latin uses "vir" for the subject, and "virum" for the object. Also, in the same sentences, we have "femina" for a subject and "feminam" for object. The form used for the direct object ("him", "virum", "feminam") is known as the "accusative case", while the form used for the subject ("he", "vir", "femina") is known as the nominative case.
German.
In some languages, like German, the accusative case is applied to the definite article and not to the noun. In German, "the car" as the subject of a sentence may be "der Wagen". This is the form in the nominative case. When "the car" is used as the object in a sentence, it becomes "den Wagen", the accusative.

The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection is a book by R.A. Fisher first published in 1930 by Oxford University Press which combines Mendelian genetics with Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. It is one of the most important books of the modern evolutionary synthesis.
Editions.
A second, slightly revised edition was published in 1958. In 1999, a third variorum edition, with the original 1930 text, annotated with the 1958 alterations, notes and alterations accidentally omitted from the second edition was published.
Its significance.
When Fisher started his career, genetics was not a well-understood science. There were biologists who did not see how evolution by natural selection could happen with heredity as they understood it. The main effect of the book was to show the small changes in genes could indeed lead to the large changes seen in the fossil record. Fisher's second chapter, the "Fundamental theory of natural selection", convinced most biologists that Darwin's idea and modern genetics were compatible (could work together). Fisher's view was reinforced by Julian Huxley, J.B.S. Haldane, Sewell Wright, Theodosius Dobzhansky, and G. Ledyard Stebbins. All of these men were in touch with genetics. With the addition of two field biologists, Ernst Mayr and Bernhard Rensch and a palaeontologist, George Simpson, the group put together the modern synthesis.
Fisher also developed ideas on sexual selection, mimicry and the evolution of dominance. He showed that mutations with big effects usually reduce the fitness of the individual. He also proved that larger populations carry more variation and have a greater chance of survival. He set the foundations for population genetics.
About a third of the book concerned the applications of genetics to humans. Using the British census data of 1911, he showed there was an inverse relationship between fertility and social class. This was partly due, he believed, to the rise in social status of families who were not capable of producing many children but who rose because of the financial advantage of having a small number of children. Therefore he suggested subsidies (he called them allowances) to families with larger numbers of children, with the allowances proportional to the earnings of the father. He himself had two sons and six daughters.
Reviews.
The book was reviewed, among others, by physicist Charles Galton Darwin, a grandson of Charles Darwin's. After his review, C.G. Darwin sent Fisher his copy of the book, with notes in the margin. The marginal notes became the food for a correspondence running at least three years.
Although Fisher's book was immediately understood by the few who understood genetics, it was a long time before the general biologist appreciated it. It is now agreed to be one of the foundations of modern population genetics and evolution.
Fisher's book also had a major influence on W.D. Hamilton and the development of his theories on the genetic basis for kin selection. Hamilton, a leading theoretician of the later 20th century, said:

County Meath () is a county in Ireland. It is part of the province of Leinster. It is named after the ancient "Kingdom of Mide" (in Gaelic "Mide" means "middle"). 184,135 people lived in the county according to the 2011 census. The county town is Navan, this is where the county hall and government are located. Trim used to be the county town. 
The River Boyne flows through the county.
History.
The county is sometimes known by the nickname "The Royal County" because of its history as the seat of the High King of Ireland. 
County Meath formed the eastern part of the former Kingdom of Mide. The seat of the High King of Ireland was at Tara which is not far from Navan. 
The archaeological complex of "Brú na Bóinne" is 5,000 years old. It includes the burial sites of Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth, in the north-east of the county. It is a UNESCO designated World Heritage Site.
Economy.
The county has a lot of farms, mainly cattle, dairying, potatoes and grain. Meath is Ireland's leading county producer of potatoes, and a significant producer of beef, barley, milk, wheat, and root vegetables. Europe's largest underground lead-zinc mine, Tara Mines, has operated since 1977, at a location to the west of Navan. 

Maria Schneider (born Marie Christine Gélin, Paris, 27 March 1952 - 3 February 2011) was a French actress. She was in many movies. She played Jeanne in the 1972 erotic movie "Last Tango in Paris" opposite Marlon Brando. Schneider died in Paris from cancer at age fifty-eight.

Spiritualism is a belief that humans can communicate with the spirits of the dead. It was popular in the nineteenth century up to the 1930s. The main centres were in America and Europe, with the Caribbean and South America, where it is usually called Spiritism.
Spiritualism did not have a book with authority, but it had pamphlets, meetings and mediums. A medium is a person, often female, who acts as a go-between between the living and the dead. 
At its peak, spiritualism was very popular, and its followers formed Spiritualist churches.

Vasodilation is where blood vessels widen. It results from relaxation of muscle cells within blood vessel walls. The process is essentially the opposite of vasoconstriction, which is the narrowing of blood vessels. 
When vessels widen, blood flow is increased. This in turn decreases blood pressure. Drugs that cause vasodilation are called vasodilators.

Ocean County is a county in New Jersey that contains most of the Jersey Shore. The county seat is Toms River. The population is 637,229 as of 2020.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (which is also known as "B-cell" and "T-cell lymphomas") is a cancer of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. It is also part of the immune system. Clear fluid called "lymph" flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as "lymphocytes".
In lymphoma, these lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way. A lot of them appear in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties making you more vulnerable to infection.
The most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin.
The usual way to know that a person has non-Hodgkin lymphoma is to do a biopsy (testing a sample of affected lymph node tissue).

Dorothy Eaton (? - probably no later than 1624) was a passenger on the "Mayflower" in 1620. She was John Carver's maidservant. Her maiden name is unknown. William Bradford wrote of Carver's maidservant, "[she] married, and died a year or two after here in this place." She may have been Francis Eaton's second wife. A 1626 apprenticeship record from Bristol, England, mentions Francis Eaton, carpenter in New England, and his wife Dorothy.

Gustav II Adolf (19 December 1594 – 16 November 1632) was the King of Sweden from 1611 to 1632. He is known in English as Gustavus Adolphus.
He is often said to have made Sweden a great power. (). He is also said to be one of the best military leaders of all time. Gustav led Sweden to be a military power during the Thirty Years' War and spent most of his reign fighting.
Life.
Gustavus Adolphus was born in Stockholm. His parents were Charles IX of Sweden and his second wife, Christina of Holstein-Gottorp. When his father died in October 1611, while Gustavus was only 16 years old, he became King of Sweden.
Gustavus married Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg, daughter of John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg. Their daughter Christina later became Queen of Sweden.
In June 1630 he landed in Germany, starting the Swedish fight in the Thirty Year's War on the Anti-Imperial Protestant side, which was losing at the time. With Sweden's help the situation flipped so that the Protestants were winning.
Gustavus died in the Battle of Lützen in 1632 while leading a cavalry attack.
Gustavus Adolphus Day.
Gustavus Adolphus Day is on 6 November. Every year it is celebrated in Sweden, Estonia and Finland. On this day only, a special pastry is sold that has a chocolate or marzipan medallion of the king.

The Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions is a yearly tournament on the American television game show "Jeopardy!". It features 15 players who have won the most games from the past season. It started in 1964 when Art Fleming was host of the show; it is also played on the show with Alex Trebek as host until 2019, with Buzzy Cohen guest hosting the 2021 Tournament of Champions. Ken Jennings is now the host of the tournament starting with the 2022 Tournament of Champions. Winners of the College Championship (since 1989) and the Teachers Tournament (since 2011) also play in the Tournament of Champions.
"Jeopardy!"'s Tournament of Champions takes two weeks. The first five games are the quarterfinals, with three new contestants each day. The winners of the five games move on to the semi-finals. The four players with the highest scores who did not win their quarterfinal game also move on as "wild card" players. If there is a tie at the end of a game, one final answer is given, and the first player to ring in with the correct response wins the game. If all three players have a score of zero, none of the players move on to the semi-finals, and another wild card spot is added. The next three games are the semi-final games. The three winners of the semi-finals move on to the finals, which happens over two games and two days. Unlike the quarterfinals, if all three players have a score of zero, one final answer is given, with the first player to ring in with the correct question wins the game. This rule change was first implemented in 2013 to avoid a repeat of the November 2012 taping of the Teen Tournament which made it unfair for contestants who played in the semifinal before the zero loss. In each finals game, the players start with zero scores; after the second finals game, each player's score is added to their score from the first game, with the highest score being the winner, or "Grand Champion." The other two players win smaller cash prizes or their two-day total, whichever is higher.
In 2022 (Season 38) the tournament took a new format which expanded the field to 21 contestants. The top three seeded contestants will qualify for the semifinal rounds; the remaining 18 contestants will play six quarterfinal games, with no wild-card spots given. The six winners will advance to the semifinals and join the top three seeds. The winners of the semifinal matches will advance to the finals, which will consist of a minimum of three and a maximum of seven games, similar to the "Greatest of All Time" tournament (see below). The first finalist to win three games will win the tournament and the $250,000 top prize. The second-place and third-place prizes will be determined first by number of wins, then by number of second-place finishes, and finally by total score across all games played, and will win $100,000 and $50,000, respectively. 
From time to time, special Tournaments of Champions have been played. In 2002, the show held a Million Dollar Masters tournament. This was a two-week tournament where the winner won $1,000,000. It was taped at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. In 2005, the show held an Ultimate Tournament of Champions. It was a 15-week tournament with 145 players. The two players who made it to the finals would play against Ken Jennings for $2,000,000. In 2014, the show held a Battle of the Decades to commemorate the show's 30th anniversary. It was a 5-week tournament featuring 45 players; the field of contestants was broken up into three decades. The first three weeks featured players from their respective decades. Five winners from each decade advanced to the quarterfinals to compete for a $1,000,000 grand prize.
List of participants.
The following is a list of contestants and where they placed in the tournament. Prize amounts for the non-winning finalists who won more than the minimum guarantees are as indicated in parentheses.

The Jeopardy! College Championship is a yearly tournament on the American television game show "Jeopardy!" It features full-time undergraduate college students who have not yet gotten a degree.
The Jeopardy! College Championship is one of the traditional tournaments held each season on the TV quiz show Jeopardy! Contestants in this tournament are full-time undergraduate college students with no prior degrees and traditionally wear a sweater bearing the name of their college or university during their appearances. The existence of this tournament does not disqualify college students from auditioning for the regular shows, but tournament participants cannot later compete in regular play. The tournament began during the 1988-89 season (Season 5) and has been played every season (except for seasons 31, 35, and 37), always during any one of the three traditional sweeps ratings periods (November, February, or May) with the exception of being held in April 2018 due to Alex Trebek's brain surgery and April 2020 due to The Greatest of All Time Tournament. Some contestants for the inaugural tournament were selected through contestant searches held in Daytona Beach, Florida, and Palm Springs, California, during the Spring break season in 1989.
Format.
The College Championship uses a ten-game format similar to that used for the Tournament of Champions and the Teen Tournament: 15 players, in groups of three, play in five quarterfinal games; the winners of those five games and the four highest-scoring nonwinners as wild cards become the nine semifinalists who compete in three games, with no two players rematching each other in the semifinal round. The three semifinal winners advance to the two-day final round, in which contestants play two separate matches, with the contestants' combined scores for both matches determining the champion (contestants start with $0 each day).
Prizes.
Cash.
All College Championship contestants receive cash prizes, based on their progress through the tournament. Contestants eliminated prior to the finals receive fixed payouts, while contestants in the finals receive guaranteed minimums, but can earn more. Over time, the prizes have increased in value, as shown below:
Trophies.
Winners also receive a small replica trophy of the larger College Championship trophy, which is retained by "Jeopardy!" in Southern California. On the larger trophy are engraved the names of every year's winner.
Vehicles.
From 1993–2004, the winner also won a new car (Dodge from 1993–1994, Volvo from 1995–2003, and Volkswagen in 2004), and the company who manufactured the car matched each finalists' totals and set up scholarships in those amounts earned for the finalists' schools.
Tournament of Champions.
In addition to the above-mentioned winnings, the winner earns an automatic position in the next Tournament of Champions, though two winners (Vinita Kailasanath in 2001 and Joey Beachum in 2008) deferred their berths in their intended tournament until the following installments due to scheduling conflicts. Three College Champions have made the Tournament of Champions finals (Tom Cubbage in 1989, Jeff Stewart in 1994, and Cliff Galiher in 2007), but only Cubbage won the event.
Many college champions have been invited to later Jeopardy! "all-time best" tournaments as well, with varying degrees of success:
List of participants.
The following is a list of contestants and where they placed in the tournament. Finalists who earned more than the minimum guarantee are as indicated. 
 Milo Dochow was a losing contestant in the Winter 1999 Teen Tournament but was invited to participate in the following year's College Championship after being potentially disadvantaged by a questionable judges' ruling in Final Jeopardy!.
 The first quarterfinal match of the 1992 College Championship ended in a tie, between Chris Montplasir and Ken Kansa. Chris won the tie-breaker to earn a spot in the semifinals and Ken earned enough money to earn a wildcard spot (although two other tie-breaker clues were given and correct responses were given for neither, resulting in editing out of the broadcast). The first semifinal match of the 1997 College Championship also ended in a tie, between Steven Beiver and Brian Chan. Steven gave the correct response to the tie-breaker clue to earn a spot in the finals.
 Kevin ended up with $0 going into the Day Two Final Jeopardy!, and ineligible to play. He was kept to have his first day score tabulated for purposes of the final score in the two day total dollars format.
 Kate Laubscher, Hannah Norem, and Michael Sieja were tied at $14,400 in the quarterfinals at the end of Final Jeopardy. Hannah led going into Final Jeopardy, while Kate and Michael tied. Kate led going into Double Jeopardy, eliminating Michael for the last spot in the semifinals.
Stanford University is the only college to have two winners.
The only College Champions from Ivy League schools are Terry O'Shea of Princeton University in 2014 and Dhruv Gaur of Brown University in 2018.

The Tet Offensive was a military campaign during the Vietnam War that started on 30 January 1968. It was fought by the communist forces of the Viet Cong in South Vietnam, which were aided by North Vietnam, against the South Vietnamese government, aided by the United States and other allies.
Its purpose was to surprise the enemy with attacks against military and civilian commands and control centers in South Vietnam.
Eventually, the Americans and the South Vietnamese managed to fight off the communist forces for a military victory. However, the massive fighting during the Tet Offensive made most Americans go from supporting the fighting in Vietnam to opposing it. The military and the government had told the Americans that the their country was close to winning. After that was disproved by the offensive, the US was said to have won the battle but to have lost the war.

"A Hazy Shade of Winter" is a hit song performed by Simon and Garfunkel in the 1960s. It was covered by The Bangles two decades later. The song was released by itself at first, but was later released as part of the album "Bookends", released in 1968. This single is about sadness during winter. The Bangles version was released in November 1987. Both versions became major hit singles. In the late 1980s, the Bangles' version became more popular than the first version.

Digital Audio Tape is a magnetic tape that permits to record audio. The recording is digital, its quality is similar to that of a compact disc. It was developed in the 1980s to replace the compact casette. Like tapes used for recording video, the tape can only be played in one direction, the "cassette" only has one side. It competed with Digital Compact Cassette (DCC), and the Minidisc. Unlike these however, it allows for an exact digital copy of the source; DCC and Minidisc use lossy data compression.
DAT tapes were also used to back up computer data in the 1990s and early 2000s. Most computer DAT drives will not read audio DAT tapes.

The Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) was a format of magnetic tape, developed to replace the compact cassette. It competed with the Minidisc and the Digital Audio Tape (DAT), but neither format could replace the compact cassette. It was marketed as a cheaper alternative to DAT. 
Equipment for the digital compact cassette was able to playback analog compact cassettes as well; recording could only be done to DCC, though. A DCC tape is similar in appearance to a regular cassette, except that it has reel access holes on only one side, and has a shutter covering both the tape and reel access holes, similar to the shutter on a floppy disk. This protects the tape and also prevents it from being accidentally inserted into an analog cassette deck.
Unlike DAT, DCC uses lossy data compression. This means that the copy of the data is not identical to the original. Audio data could be compressed to about 25% of its original size. 
The main problem of the format was tied to handling: Finding a song in the middle of a 90 minute tape takes several minutes. With Minidisc it is instantaneous. Minidisc allows to delete or move tracks, features which the digital compact cassette cannot offer. 
Even though some of the features were addressed (like rewinding a 90 minute tape in less than a minute), the format never gained much market share. The compression format used by DCC is based on MP1, which came before MP3. The CD-R, which is compatible with standard CD players, eventually replaced both DCC and MiniDisc for home audio recording. The CD-R also replaced analog tape.

The revenge of the Forty-seven Ronin took place in Japan at the start of the 18th century. It describes a historical event, but there is a lot of fiction added to the story too.
The story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless (becoming "ronin") after their daimyo (lord) Asano Naganori had to kill himself by committing "seppuku" (ritual suicide). He had to do this because he assaulted a court official named Kira Yoshinaka. The "ronin" waited and planned almost two years, and then killed Kira to avenge their master's honour. They delivered Kira's head to Asano's grave. After that, the "ronin" had to kill themselves by committing "seppuku" as they had committed the crime of murder.
One noted Japanese scholar described the tale, the most famous example of the samurai code of honor, "bushidō," as the country's "national legend." 

The term Cinephilia refers to when someone has a strong interest in cinema, movie theories and movie criticism. Since the silent era, there have been various waves of cinephiles, people with strong interest for cinema and movies. The movie community which may have been best noted in relations to cinephilia, however, are one that was developed during World War II around Paris, France. A major influx of foreign movies, alongside a screening program used with certain local movie clubs, generated interest for world cinema among the intellectual youth culture of the city. This community fostered a strong interest in directors and movies which may have been neglected, forgotten or simply not known in the West. Notable directors of French cinephiles in this period include although are not limited to Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Welles. This profession has become less connected with movie going due to presence of DVDs and VHS cassettes.

Bois de la Cambre () is a forest in Brussels. It used to be part of the Sonian Forest but now it is separate.
The main road around the lake has been closed to traffic on Saturdays and Sundays since the 1990s.
In 1815, on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo, the British soldiers played cricket on land that is now part of the Bois de la Cambre.
There is a park that includes horse rides, an ice rink, boating activities and fishing are organized. Bois de la Cambre is connected to the Sonian Forest as in the past it used to be part of it. Three entries are from the Avenue Franklin Roosevelt.
The Chalet Robinson.
In the 1990s the Chalet Robinson was built on the an island on the lake. The restaurant was destroyed by a fire in 1991. The decision was made in 2006 to rebuild it and it reopened to the public in September 2009. An electrical boat has been made so you can pass from the shore to the island.
Events.
Two days per year there is a race, "24 hours race Bois de la Cambre" that is played by the young scouts other activities are also organized for the young scouts. In 2013 the 24 hours race was canceled because of the cold, wind and rain. Other smaller events are also organized in the park.
Sometimes, sports demonstrations, outdoor concerts, processions coupling, theaters animation or games for children are held during the summer. In the last week-end of August the Fiesta Latina is organized witch includes Latin food and concerts. In September an Eat festival was organized but the first two days were ruined because of the rain.

Prader–Willi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder. It causes obesity, slow sexual development and low intelligence. People with Prader–Willi syndrome also have a higher chance of getting diabetes mellitus, and cannot have children. They are hungry very often, and eat much more than other people. It was first described in 1956. Prader-Willi syndrome is usually diagnosed with a genetic test. Prader-Willi syndrome has no cure. It can be treated with behavioural therapy.

Sake Dean Mahomed (; 1759 – 24 February 1851) was an Indian traveler, surgeon and entrepreneur. He introduced South Asian cuisine (and Indian) and shampoo baths to Europe, where he also offered therapeutic massage., in addition to that he was the first Indian writer to be published in English.
At the age of 11, Mahomed joined the East India Company Army and rose to the rank of captain. He fought in a number of campaigns until 1782 when he resigned from the army and two years later arrived in Britain. Staying in Ireland he wrote and published his book, The Travels of Dean Mahomet. He later moved to Portman Square where he became an assistant to Sir Basil Cochrane at his vapour bath.
This is where Mr Mahomed is said to have added an Indian treatment, champi (shampooing) or therapeutic massage, to Cochrane's bath which became very fashionable.
Sake Dean Mahomed also developed a fashionable massage.
In 1810 he opened the Hindoostane Coffee House which was located off of George Street, near Portman Square, Central London. The restaurant served Hookah with real Chilm tobacco and Indian-style dishes. The premises is now a building called Carlton House.
To many who are now part of the city's expansive curry house business, Mahomed was a pioneer.
Although forced to declare bankruptcy in 1812, he created a concept that was to become something of a phenomenon 100 years later, said Vivek Singh, chef at the Cinnamon Club, a Westminster restaurant serving New Indian cuisine.
Mr Mahomed's plan had been to serve "Indianised" British food which would appeal to the Indian aristocracy in London as well as British people who had returned from India, he said.
"The Indian aristocracy however would not come out to eat in the restaurant because they had chefs at home cooking more authentic food - it was just not a big enough draw to come out."
A few years later he opened special treatment baths on the seafront at East Cliff, Brighton.
He died in 1851 and was buried in St Nicholas' churchyard in Brighton

A tuber is the thickened part of an underground stem of a plant, such as the potato, with buds from which new plant shoots (stems and young leaves of a new plant) grow.
Most tubers are formed in the ground, but sometimes they can be formed above the ground, in the aerial stems; that is the case of the air potato ("Dioscorea bulbifera").
Functions.
Tuber stems (or part of stems) are made bigger to store nutrients. Starch (formed by a lot of glucose molecules) is the most commonly stored food in the tubers, although other carbohydrates, such as inuline (formed by many fructose molecules), are stored in the tubers of certain kinds of plants, like the Jerusalem artichoke ("Helianthus tuberosus").
The purpose of tubers are saving food and reproduction. Under natural conditions, the parts of the stem that connect the tubers with the main stem die in the autumn or winter. The tubers are left in the ground and are able to produce shoots from their buds the following spring.
Potatoes are also artificially reproduced by tuber pieces, called "seed pieces". A tuber is cut into pieces, each with one or more "eyes" (an "eye" of potato is a group of buds covered by very small leaves). These pieces are planted and each produces a new plant from one of its "eyes".
Tuberous roots.
A tuberous root or storage root, is a modified lateral root, made bigger to function as a storage organ; sometimes these roots are called "tubers" but they are roots, not modified stems like the true tubers. They are thus different in origin but similar in function and appearance to tubers. Examples of plants with important tuberous roots include the sweet potato, cassava, yam and dahlia.

During a match, players can collect orbs that are in a stage. Collecting orbs builds up a power meter that is at the bottom of the screen. When a player is hit, their meter goes down. When the meter is full, the player can use one of three very powerful attacks that can be used to beat opponents and get points. Up to four players can battle with characters from Sony's video games, including "God of War", "Sly Cooper" and "PaRappa the Rapper".
Items.
There are many different items from Sony's different series that can be picked up and used by players. They can be used by players to do better in the match or hurt opponents.
Stages.
There are 14 stages in the game. Each stage is based on a combination of two games. For example, the stage "Stowaways" is based on the games "Uncharted" and "Bioshock Infinite".

The silvertip shark ("Carcharhinus albimarginatus"), is a large species of requiem shark, family Carcharhinidae, found in the Indian and Pacific Ocean. This shark has white tips on its fins. With an average length of 2-2.5 metres, the silvertip shark rarely reaches the length of 3 meters.
Description.
The silvertip shark is slender with a long and broadly rounded snout. The eyes are large and round. An interdorsal ridge is present on this species. The first dorsal fin is large with a pointed apex. It originates over or slightly in front of the free tips of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin originates over or just behind the origin of the anal fin. The pectoral fins are large and semifalcate with narrowly rounded or pointed tips. The caudal fin is asymmetrical in shape with a rather large upper lobe. 
The top of the body is dark grey or grey-brown with a bronzy sheen, and the underside is white. A white band, which is not clearly visible, is on its flank. 
The silvertip shark may be confused with the grey reef shark ("Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos"), but the grey reef shark has dark tips on the pectoral fins and trailing edge of the caudal fin. Also, the whitetip reef shark ("Triaenodon obesus") is similar in appearance to the silvertip shark. Although both shark species have white markings on the dorsal and caudal fins, the whitetip reef shark doesn't have these markings on the tips of the pectoral fins. The whitetip reef shark also has a more square-shaped snout.
The silvertip shark has 12-14 teeth on each jaw. The upper teeth are broad and strongly jagged. 
Habitat.
Silvertip sharks are found over continental and island shelves and offshore banks. They prefer offshore islands, coral reefs and banks to depths of 800 m. They are common in tropical oceans. 
They have been found in the western Indian Ocean: the Red Sea and of East Africa, including Madagascar, Seychelles, Aldabra Group, Mauritius and the Chagos Archipelago. In the western Pacific they are found off southern Japan to northern Australia and French Polynesia. In the eastern central Pacific they are found off southern Baja California, Mexico to Colombia, including the Cocos, Galápagos, and Revillagigedo Islands. 
Behaviour.
This shark is a great hunter and is very stealthy. They are usually found in shallow waters, making them one of the most commonly seen sharks. Its unpredictable behaviour and aggressive hunting tactics make it a higher threat to humans than most other sharks.
Feeding.
Prey of the silvertip shark include benthic and midwater fish such as wahoo, eagle rays, wrasses, and tunas as well as small sharks. This shark also feeds on octopuses and squid. The silvertip shark has been observed swimming along the edge of a group of other species of feeding sharks, taking food from them.
Reproduction.
The silvertip shark is viviparous, meaning that they give live birth. Courtship is a little different in these sharks and they are known to hold each other. Bites are normal, so much so that a female Silvertip shark has been found without a part of the dorsal fin after mating. Mating occurs in the summer. During the gestation period that could extend to a year, the embryos feed from the yolk and once the yolk is exhausted, the yolk-sac modifies itself into a placental connection through which the newborns feed from the mother.
The newborns are born in litters (normally 5 to 6 but can be from 1 to 11) and are anywhere between 63 to 81 centimeters or 25 to 32 inches long. The females are considered sexually mature once they grow to be about 2 meters long and in the case of males, it is 1.8 meters. The pups are known to swim with the mother shark in shallow waters before becoming independent.
Human interaction.
Silvertip sharks are somewhat dangerous. According to the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), there have been four unprovoked attacks by this species on humans, with no deaths. Arguably, humans are much more dangerous to the shark. Silvertips are caught by commercial and artisan fisheries across their range using longlines, gillnets, and trawls, both intentionally and as bycatch. Their fins are highly valued for shark-fin soup and are sold on the export market, along with their skin and cartilage.
This species is vulnerable to overfishing (like almost all sharks) due to its slow reproductive rate. The IUCN has listed the silvertip shark as near threatened, and has noted that it may be approaching the criteria for vulnerable.
The silvertip shark is caught by fisheries in Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines. In the Philippines, it is in the top ten most caught species by number (0.73%), and weight (2.6%), with individuals ranging in size from 2.1-2.4 metres, and averaging 23 kg in weight. 

Sten &amp; Stanley is a dansband from the town of Karlskoga in Sweden. It was established in 1962.

The Open University (OU) is a distance learning and research university founded by Royal Charter in the United Kingdom.
The university is funded by the British state, and by student fees and contract income. It has an open entry policy. This means that students' previous academic achievements are not taken into account for entry to most undergraduate courses. Most OU undergraduate students are based in the United Kingdom and study off-campus. Many of its courses (both undergraduate and postgraduate) can be studied off-campus anywhere in the world.
There are a number of full-time postgraduate research students based on the 48 hectare university campus where they use the OU facilities for research, as well as more than 1000 members of academic and research staff and over 2500 administrative, operational and support staff.
The OU was established in 1969 and the first students enrolled in January 1971. The University administration is based at Walton Hall, Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, but has regional centres in each of its thirteen regions around the United Kingdom. It also has offices and regional examination centres in most other European countries. The University awards undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, as well as non-degree qualifications such as diplomas and certificates, or continuing education units.
With more than 250,000 students enrolled, including around 32,000 aged under 25 and more than 50,000 overseas students, it is the largest academic institution in the United Kingdom (and one of the largest in Europe) by student number. It is one of the world's largest universities. Since it was founded, more than 1.5 million students have studied its courses.
The OU was rated top university in England and Wales for student satisfaction in 2005, 2006, second in 2007, and top in 2012. These were United Kingdom government national student satisfaction surveys. Out of 132 universities and colleges, the OU was ranked 43rd (second quartile) in the "Times Higher Education" Table of Excellence in 2008. It was rated highly in Design, Art History, English, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Computer Science, Development Studies, Social Policy and Social Work, and Sociology. It was ranked overall as a nationally top forty, and globally top five hundred university by the "Academic Ranking of World Universities" in 2011, as well as being ranked 247 for citations of its academics.
The Open University is also one of only three United Kingdom higher education institutions to gain accreditation in the United States of America by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, an institutional accrediting agency, recognized by the United States Secretary of Education and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation.
Drastic drop in enrollments.
The Open University enrollments for undergraduate courses have dropped from a peak in 2009/10 of 209,705 to the latest published figure of 121,395 in 2016/17. According to The Guardian, this was caused mainly by the government. In 2012 it allowed fees for part-time degrees to rise to £6,750 per year, whilst severely limiting maintenance grants for students. Part-time courses at traditional universities in the U.K. have also suffered a drop in enrollment.

Mercy Lavinia Warren Bump (October 31, 1841 - November 25, 1919) was an American entertainer. She was the wife of Charles S. Stratton (aka General Tom Thumb), the star attraction of P. T. Barnum's American Museum in New York City.
Early years.
Warren was born in Middleborough, Massachusetts to James Bump and his wife. She stopped growing at age 10. In adulthood, Warren stood 32 inches tall, weighed 30 pounds, and was perfectly formed in every way.
She had seven siblings. Her sister "Minnie" was even smaller than she. Lavinia claimed descent from William the Conqueror and five Mayflower Pilgrims.
In her middle teens, Warren briefly taught school in Middleborough, then began appearing as an exhibit in a relative's "floating palace of curiosities" on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.
P. T. Barnum and the American Museum.
American showman P. T. Barnum heard of Warren in 1862. He invited her and her parents to visit him in his Bridgeport, Connecticut home. They did so, and Barnum found Warren, "a most refined and intelligent young lady, well educated, and an accomplished, beautiful and perfectly developed woman in miniature."
He hired her for his American Museum in New York City. She lived quietly in the home of one of his daughters in New York while he made arrangements for her debut. He assembled "a very splendid wardrobe" for Warren and provided her with "costly jewelry". She made her debut and created a sensation with the public.
Unfortunately, she was exhibited with Commodore Nutt, another little person several years her junior. He fell in love with her. She however did not reciprocate his feelings, and considered him nothing more than a "nice little boy". 
Barnum gave Warren a ring, which did not fit properly, so he told her that she might give the ring to Nutt while he provided her with another. She gave the ring to Nutt, and he regarded it as a love token. Warren was in great distress. She did not want to offend Nutt by repelling his attentions, but she did not want to encourage him either.
General Tom Thumb.
Barnum offered her $1,000 a week to exhibit herself at his Museum. She accepted and was an instant hit. The press adored her. She rivaled Stratton in popularity, and earned $3,000 a day for the Museum.
Marriage.
Warren met Stratton in 1861. They were married in Grace Episcopal Church, New York City, on February 10, 1863. Two thousand people attended their wedding, including the most celebrated persons of the day. 
Their "round the world" honeymoon included meetings with the Lincolns in Washington, D.C., and Queen Victoria in London. Barnum manufactured a hoax of the couple becoming parents (fueled with photographs), but Warren was, in fact, unable to bear children.
Later years and death.
The couple travelled widely. They returned to Barnum's employ in 1881. Thumb died in 1884, leaving his wife penniless and depressed. On April 6, 1885, Lavinia married Count Primo Magri, an Italian miniature person who had come to America seeking his fortune. 
The couple toured, then exhibited themselves at Lilliputia (aka Midget City) on Coney Island. She met United States President William Howard Taft in 1911. She once boasted that she had met Lincoln and every president after him. Lavinia died in Middleborough in 1919.

General Tom Thumb (January 4, 1838 – July 15, 1883) was an American entertainer. He was a four year old child when P. T. Barnum introduced him to show biz. The boy (who was passed off as a young adult) created a sensation at Barnum's American Museum in New York City. He toured Europe, appeared before royals, and returned to America rich. Thumb married Lavinia Warren in 1863, and continued to tour. Show biz took its toll on his health however. He died of a stroke in 1883. 
Early life.
General Tom Thumb was born Charles Sherwood Stratton in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to Sherwood Edward Stratton, a carpenter, and Cynthia (Thompson) Stratton, an inn worker. He stopped growing at 18 months. He was 25 inches tall and weighed 16 pounds in 1842 when P. T. Barnum persuaded his parents to exhibit him at $3 a week. The boy was four years old when he left home for Barnum's American Museum in New York City.
Barnum.
Barnum molded the boy into an entertainer, and provided the child with an expensive and exquisitely tailored wardrobe. He was presented as General Tom Thumb and his age bumped up to eleven years. 
He debuted on December 8, 1842. At first, he was shy about appearing in public, but he took to the stage and began imitating famous little people like Napoleon and Cupid. The General was a hit. Thirty thousand people attended his first week performances.
Barnum and Thumb toured Europe in 1844 with an appearance before Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at Buckingham Palace. Other European royals also fêted him. In America, Thumb remained the principal attraction at the American Museum for many years.
Marriage.
In 1847, Thumb returned to America very rich. Thumb eventually bought a mansion in Bridgeport, and toured alone for a time. He teamed up with Barnum at times when the showman's bank account was running low. 
In 1862, Thumb met Lavinia Warren, another of Barnum's oddities, and the miniature couple were married on February 10, 1863, in Grace Episcopal Church, New York City. The wedding was attended by 2,000 guests, many of them the A-list celebrities of the day.
Later life and death.
The couple toured for many years, and made a large fortune. In 1881, Thumb and his wife were caught in a hotel fire that almost took their lives. They joined the Barnum &amp; London Circus. Show biz took its toll on Thumb, however. His health declined. On July 15, 1883, Thumb died following a stroke, age 45. He is buried in Bridgeport, Connecticut. More than 10,000 people attended his funeral.

Leptospiras are long, thin motile spirochaetes. They may be free-living or parasitic. They survive well in fresh water, soil, and mud in tropical areas. They have been studied at the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).
Molecular taxonomic studies at CDC and elsewhere have identified 13 named and 4 unnamed species of pathogenic leptospires. Leptospirosis causes a wide range of symptoms, and some infected persons may have no symptoms at all. Symptoms of leptospirosis include high fever, severe headache, chills, muscle aches, and vomiting, and may include jaundice (yellow skin and eyes), red eyes, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or a rash.

Helicopter parents are those who hover over their children, cosseting them
and overseeing their entire lives.
The terminology began appearing around 1969. It was not until late 2002 or 2003, however, that the term became very popular via media and cell phone use. This was at exactly the same time the millennials begin turning 18 and moving into college. The rising of mobile phones is often blamed for the rise of helicopter parent-style teaching over the years. The phone enables the mother to keep in touch at all times, which was almost impossible before. What caused most notice was parents following up children as far as college and early employment. Sports coaches, college teachers and employers have had the experience of parents turning up to complain and argue in support of their children.

Gram-positive bacteria are those that are stained dark blue or violet by Gram staining. This is in contrast to gram-negative bacteria, which cannot hold the "crystal violet" stain. Instead they take up the counterstain ("safranin" or "fuchsine") and appear red or pink. 
The difference is caused by the cell wall structure. Gram-positive organisms have thick peptidoglycan layer. This protects them, so they do not need rigid cell walls. On the other hand, gram-negative bacteria have thin, insignificant peptidoglycan layers, so they do need rigid cell walls for support and protection.

Middle years.
Eventually, Bass became completely ossified. The rheumatism led to ankylosis of his joints, tendons, and muscles. They turned to bone. Things got worse. In 1869, he lost his eyesight. He had to eat by sucking food up and swallowing it whole. When his mother died in 1872, a brother began taking care of him.

A Hyperloop is a proposed type of train that would travel at very high speeds. The reason it can travel so fast is because it is inside a tube with no air. This vacuum means that there will be no friction to slow the train.
The Hyperloop is being created and tested in various places around the world, for example the United States, the Middle East and Asia.
In 2012, Elon Musk (Tesla Motors, SpaceX) proposed this technology. In 2013, he put a plan online that showed the hyperloop train taking 35 minutes to go between San Francisco and Los Angeles in the United States. He shared this technology to the world. In 2015, Musk's company built a test tube. He asked universities and companies to make the test trains. They had two competitions in 2017 to see how fast the hyperloop trains could travel. The fastest test was .

In computer science, selection sort is a method for sorting data such as numbers into an ordered list. It is not an efficient method of sorting data compared to more advanced algorithms such as quicksort and heapsort. However, it is very simple to build and is usually taught to beginners in computer science.
Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n2).
Algorithm.
When given a list of unsorted data, the algorithm will divide the list into two parts: one part that has all the sorted data and another part that has all the remaining unsorted data. When the algorithm first starts, there is no data in the first part as no data has been sorted yet and all the unsorted data is in the second part. The algorithm then starts to find the smallest item in the unsorted data and swap it with the left-most element of the list. The part with the sorted data is then the left-most element and the part with the unsorted data is the remaining unsorted elements. The algorithm repeats itself, by finding the smallest element within the list of unsorted data and swapping it with the left-most element, eventually getting a sorted data.
Here is an example of selection sort working on six elements:
Implementation.
The implementation of this algorithm requires using two nested loops. The outer loop is to work on every element in the list starting from the left-most element whereas the inner loop is to find for the smallest element within the unsorted part of the list before the smallest element is swapped with the left-most element.
A possible way of writing this algorithm in Java is shown below.
public static void selectionSort(int[] array) {
 for (int start = 0; start &lt; array.length - 1; start++) {
 int minimumId = start;
 // Find the index of the smallest number
 for (int i = start + 1; i &lt; array.length; i++) {
 if (array[i] &lt; array[minimumId]) {
 minimumId = i;
 // Swap the smallest number with the left-most element
 int temp = array[start];
 array[start] = array[minimumId];
 array[minimumId] = temp;

The Republic of Buryatia is a Mongolic federal subject in Russia. It is one of the 85 federal subjects of Russia. It is in the Siberian area of Russia. It is grouped and governed as part of the Far Eastern District. The Far Eastern District contains ten other federal subjects too. Buryatia also shares an international border with Mongolia.
History.
In the past, the Buryats were linked and related to the Mongols. It is because of the close distance and trade with each other. They also share a similar culture. Because of this the Buryats were ruled by the Mongols many times. The Xiongnu Empire (209 BC-93 CE), Kublai Khan's Mongol Empire (1206-1368) and the Northern Yuan Empire (1368-1691), were examples when the Buryats were ruled by the Mongols. Other Mongol tribes also lived in Buryatia during that time too. The Russians, who were Europeans, first arrived in the area of the present-day Buryatia during the 17th century. They came because they were looking for furs and gold. Later during the 1920s, the area was affected by the violence of the Russian Civil War. In 1923, the Buryat-Mongolian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was formed at the end of the civil war to put in place a proper rule. The area changed size and name many times while it was in the Soviet Union. The Buryat ASSR started controlling itself in 1990. This was when the Soviet Union collapsed and Buryatia took on the name Republic of Buryatia in 1992. However, it continued to be a republic in Russia.
Geography.
Buryatia is in the south central part of Siberia. Because of this it has a subarctic climate, which have long, cold winters, and short, mild summers. There is not a lot of rainfall in the area because of the climate. The landscape is mostly mountainous. Lake Baikal, the world's largest freshwater lake, is also in Buryatia. There are many animals and birds in the area. These animals and birds may appear depending on the season. The area is also rich in minerals like gold, tungsten, uranium, zinc and more.
Demographics.
Buryatia's population at the end of the Soviet Union decreased for some time, according to data. It is currently increasing again. A little bit more than half of the population live in cities and towns. Most of the people that live in cities and towns live in the capital, Ulan-Ude. Ethnic Buryats are about one third of the population. Russians mostly make up the other two-thirds of the population. Most ethnic Buryats practice a religion that is mixed with Buddhism and Shamanism, which is a belief that worships spirits and nature. On the other hand, ethnic Russians mostly practice Orthodox Christianity. Russian is taught and used commonly in Buryatia. But the Buryat language is still taught in some schools and is used mostly at home.
Economy.
The economy of Buryatia mostly relies on farming. This includes the growing of crops and rearing of animals. The mining of minerals contributes to the economy of Buryatia. The building of military equipment and machines also contribute to the economy of Buryatia. Lake Baikal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Tourism to Lake Baikal and Buddhist sites are also more areas that have helped the economy.
Politics.
The Head of Buryatia is the leader of the republic. The Head is chosen by public vote every five years. The People's Khural, is the republic's parliament. The People's Khural lawmakers are chosen similarly by the public every five years. The majority of these lawmakers are currently from the United Russia party. The United Russia party is the ruling party of Russia. The republic was part of the Siberia Federal District before it was transferred to the current Far East Federal District.
Transportation.
Buryatia lies along the important Trans-Siberian railway and Trans-Siberian Highway. The railway and highway links Moscow with Asia. They also connect Buryatia with the rest of Russia. The republic has several airports, including Baikal International Airport.

The grassland being covered by trees is a major threat to the long-term existence of the main plants. Trees cover any grasses growing under them, mainly those that need more sunlight. Tree seeds are spread all over the grasslands. They mostly germinate near existing trees. Also, trees help in the growth of shade-loving grasses and prevent the growth of sun-loving species.

Asia Bibi blasphemy case involves the conviction of a Pakistani Christian woman, Asia Noreen , for blasphemy by a Pakistani court. She was sentenced to death in 2010. However, she was acquitted by the Supreme Court in 2018.
Case background and Court verdict.
In June 2009, while harvesting berries from a field, Asia was seen drinking water from a communal cup by some village women of that area. It was considered offensive by the women due to her religion, and the cup was labelled "contaminated". This resulted in an argument between them, and the women accused her of blasphemy.
In 2010, a judge in Sheikhupura sentenced Asia to death, which was upheld by the Lahore High Court. Petitions were sent for her release, including one sent by Pope Francis.
Noreen's husband appealed to the high court. Salman Taseer, the Governor of Punjab, supported Noreen throughout and requested President Asif Ali Zardari to pardon her.
Due to this support, Taseer was killed by his guard Mumtaz Qadri.
Several appeals were made during this period and the High Court upheld the decision. In October 2014, Lahore High Court rejected her appeal.
In November 2014, her lawyer appealed to the Supreme Court.
On 31 October 2018, the Supreme Court panel chaired by Justice Saqib Nisar, acquitted Asia Bibi. Although the majority supported the decision, it resulted in protests by the Islamic parties, mainly Tehreek-e-Labaik.

Chinese place names are the names of places in China. Since the Chinese language has not had any sort of phonetic alphabet until only about a few hundred years ago (compared to the thousands of years the Chinese characters have been used), there has been a lot of confusion on naming places in Chinese. Since Chinese characters are a logographic writing system, meaning that the writing mainly shows the words' meaning rather than its pronunciation, it can be used to write down words in many different languages. On top of all this, the Chinese language is not one unified language, but an entire branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Many of the Chinese languages or dialects are mutually unintelligible, which means a speaker of one language or dialect cannot understand a speaker of another unless one of them already knew the other's language or dialect. For example, Mandarin and Cantonese are both dialects of Chinese, but they are so different from each other than their speakers cannot understand the other unless at least one speaker knew both. Therefore, knowing which spoken dialect to use when writing out the name in the Roman alphabet, which is a phonetic writing system and not a logographic one, can be challenging. For example, while the name of the city is written as �� in Chinese, it is called "Běijīng" in Mandarin and "Bak1 Ging1" in Cantonese.
In mainland China, most place names are in Mandarin Chinese, the country's official spoken language. Even though the sounds of Mandarin Chinese have not changed for a long time, there were many different ways to write Chinese place names in Mandarin using the Roman alphabet, or many different kinds of romanizations. This created a lot of confusion and misinformation for non-Chinese speakers on what to call Chinese place names. For example, Beijing was spelled Peking, Nanjing was called Nanking, Tianjin was spelled Tiantsin, and Qingdao was spelled Tsingtao. These many spelling systems caused confusion among non-Chinese speakers and therefore whatever name speakers of other languages called place names ended up sounding very different from Mandarin Chinese. In order to teach people how to correctly pronounce Mandarin Chinese, to mainland Chinese and non-Chinese alike, the Chinese Communist Party made Hanyu Pinyin the only accepted romanization in official use and banned all other romanizations in official use in mainland China. Peking became Beijing, Nanking became Nanjing, Tiantsin became Tianjin, and Tsingtao became Qingdao. While the pronunciation of these place names stayed the same in Mandarin, it allowed non-Chinese speakers, especially English speakers, to say Chinese place names much more accurately to their Mandarin pronunciations.
However, in the autonomous regions, places in China where certain minority groups make up a large part of the region's population, many place names changed back from Chinese to the local languages in order to represent the local languages. For example, the city of Dihua (��) was changed back to Urumqi, which is the name of the city in the local Uyghur language, after the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region was formed.
In Taiwan, where Mandarin Chinese is also the official language, the spelling of place names tends to be inconsistent. The names of Taiwanese cities are usually in Chinese postal romanization. This is why the cities are spelled Taipei, Kaohsiung, and Taichung instead of Taibei, Gaoxiong, and Taizhong, which is how they would be spelled in Hanyu Pinyin. This is the case because many Taiwanese dislike using Hanyu Pinyin (even though it is the standard romanization of Mandarin Chinese worldwide) because it was created by the Chinese Communist Party, which many Taiwanese do not like. While within northern Taiwanese cities most names of streets, districts, and subway stops are in Hanyu Pinyin (since Hanyu Pinyin is generally more accepted in the north), cities in southern Taiwan use many different spelling systems simply to resist using Hanyu Pinyin. In several cases, the exact same street can be spelled several different ways. For example, in Banqiao, Xinzhan Road (���) is spelled "Shinjann Rd." on one section and "Sin Jhan Rd." on another.

The Chukotka Autonomous Okrug is the farthest east of all 85 federal subjects of Russia. It is located in the Asian part of Russia. It is grouped and governed as part of the Far Eastern District. The Far Eastern District contains ten other federal subjects too. Chukotka also shares an international sea border with Alaska of the United States.
History.
In ancient times, the present area of Chukotka was joined with North America by a land bridge known as Beringia. It was believed that humans first migrated to the Americas using this route. Later, the area was home to the Chukchi people and other natives. Some of these natives are related to the Inuit. By the 17th century, the Russians first arrive to gain control of the natives. At first, not much attention was given to the remote land of Chukotka. But its natural resources and the ability to use the area to attack land further away was soon discovered. The Russians then made multiple attempts to bring the natives under their control by force. However, these attempts failed. The Russians finally made peace with the Chukchis in 1778. Through the 19th and 20th centuries, other foreign powers also attempted to claim the land and resources in the region. They were instead driven away by the Russians. The Russians were increasingly worried about their presence. During the Soviet Union, the natives were brought under state's control and made to resettle. Multiple gulags were also built in the area. Tin and much later gold was mined from the area after the start of World War II. The tin and gold were used to supply the war efforts. In 1991, at the collapse of the Soviet Union, Chukotka declared its separation to become a subject of Russia. It continues to remain as an autonomous okrug till today.
Geography.
Chukotka is the eastern most point of Russia and mainland Asia. It is separated from Alaska, United States, by the Bering Strait and the International Date Line. Chukotka is found in the north-eastern part of Siberia. Because of this it has a polar tundra climate, which have long, cold winters, and short, mild summers. There is not a lot of rainfall in the area because of the climate. The ground is mostly frozen as well. The landscape is mostly barren, with limited animals and plants. The area however is rich in minerals. The Wrangel Island found north of Chukotka is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Demographics.
Chukotka's population has been decreasing since the end of the Soviet Union according to data. About 65% of the population live in cities and towns. Ethnic Chukchis compose of roughly a third of the population. Russians make up about half the population. People of other local ethnicity make up the rest of the population. Most Chukchis either practice Shamanism, which is a belief that worships spirits and nature, or Orthodox Christianity. Russian is taught and used commonly in Chukotka. The Chukchi language usage is decreasing and is used mostly at home. There are currently attempts to make it popular again.
Economy.
The economy of Chukotka is mostly reliant on mining of minerals, like coal, gold, natural gas and oil. Most of Chukotka's population take jobs under big companies that are involve in mining. The rest of the rural population continue to practice reindeer herding, whale hunting, and fishing. The growing of crops and rearing of animals are mostly not possible because of the climate. Besides that, sea trade via the Northern Sea Route is expected to improve the economy. This sea route is expected to become ready in the future.
Politics.
The Governor of Chukotka is the leader of the okrug. The Governor is chosen by public vote every five years. The Duma of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, is the okrug's parliament. The Duma members of parliament are chosen similarly by the public every five years. There are now 15 members of parliament. The majority of these lawmakers in the Duma are currently from the United Russia party. The United Russia part is the ruling party of Russia. Roman Abramovich, a former governor of Chukotka, is famous for being the owner of Chelsea Football Club. He has donated more than US$2.5 billion to build schools, hospitals and buildings in Chukotka.
Transportation.
Chukotka does not have railroads or many roads, making travel difficult. Most long-distance travel is by sea or air. The okrug has several airports, such as the Ugolny Airport. However, there are no international flights. Special permits are needed to enter Chukotka because the area is along an international border.

Grampu is a character from the TV show "Oobi". He is a talking hand puppet with eyes. He is the grandfather and guardian of Oobi and Uma. He was made by Josh Selig and first showed on TV in 2000. The person who played the role of Grampu was Tyler Bunch, an actor who works with puppets.
Role.
Grampu is an old man. He lives with his two grandkids, Oobi and Uma. Their parents and grandma are never seen or talked about, so Grampu is the only one who takes care of them. He likes to teach them about the world. He shows them how to do new things. As a running gag (repeated joke) in the show, Grampu is very unlucky and usually has to clean up messes that the kids make.
Grampu's favorite things to do are cooking and growing plants in his garden. When he is in the kitchen, he wears a big chef's hat and an apron. He is in love with Inka, an old woman from France who is Oobi's piano teacher. Grampu and Inka like to go on dates and eat fancy food.
Grampu has hazel eyes and doesn't wear any clothes. His hand is in a different position from the other characters. His fingers are curled in a fist instead of being extended, making him taller and giving him a toothless look.
Creation.
Grampu was made by Josh Selig, the maker of the whole show. Josh Selig wanted to show a non-traditional family: a family that was different from most ones shown on TV. This is why he came up with the idea for Oobi and Uma to live with their single grandpa.
In the first episodes of "Oobi", which were short two-minute stories, Grampu was a secondary character who did not show up very much. When the show was turned into a longer half-hour program, Grampu got a bigger role. The show writers used him as a (a contrasting character) to the kids, or as someone to give them advice. Grampu appeared more than he used to, and he was part of almost every single episode.
The person who played the role of Grampu was Tyler Bunch. Bunch is a puppeteer (an actor who works with puppets) known from the show "Sesame Street". While he was playing the part of Grampu, Bunch had to never shave his arm, so that Grampu would look like an old, hairy man. This was different from the other actors, who all had to shave their arms because they played kid characters. Bunch had a manicurist who filed his nails every week during filming.
Reception.
Grampu has gotten a good reception from viewers and critics. Many parents who watched "Oobi" with their kids thought he was the funniest part of the show. In an interview, Josh Selig said "many mothers seem to have developed a 'thing' for Grampu." , a writer of comedy books, called him "a hilarious character" in his book "Alternadad". He also wrote that Grampu seemed like a "children's TV character with whom we could spend an afternoon if [he] magically came to life."
The newspaper "St. Paul Pioneer Press" included Grampu as a good example of an unusual family unit in children's TV. In a satirical article that made fun of people wanting to keep gay and single parents out of media for kids, the newspaper called attention to Grampu being a single stay-home parent with a foreign girlfriend (Inka).
Other media.
Grampu has appeared in media outside of the "Oobi" show. From 2006 to 2013, toy versions of Grampu's puppet eyes (made of the material acrylic) were sold on an online shopping site called OobiEyes.com. They were available in different sizes for kids' and adults' hands.
In 2007, Grampu appeared several times on a talk show called "" when it featured clips from "Oobi". They were shown in a part called "What the Kids Are Watching", when the host Joel McHale made comments about funny scenes from kids' shows. Grampu also appeared in a video by the YouTube star Shane Dawson in November 2009, when he imitated Oobi and Grampu with his own hands.
In "Oobi: Dasdasi", a spin-off of the original "Oobi" show made in 2012, Grampu was reimagined as "Grandpa", a new character with a similar role.

The Guangzhou Metro () is the metro system of Guangzhou, Guangdong in China. It is operated by the Guangzhou Metro Corporation. It was the fourth metro system that was built in mainland China. The Guangzhou Metro was planned many times. The planning of the metro began in the 1980s and in 1993 the construction of the first line began. In 1997 the metro opened. The first line was Line 1.
The metro system has 13 lines. They are Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 5, Line 6, Line 7, Line 8, Line 9, Line 13, Line 14, Guangfo Line, and the Zhujiang New Town APM. All of these lines connect the urban core and the suburbs. The Guangfo Line connects Guangzhou and Foshan. Over seven million people ride the metro everyday and it was used 2.56 billion times. This makes the metro the fourth busiest metro in the world.
History.
First ideas and planning.
Chen Yu, who was the Governor of Guangdong from 1957 to 1967, first had an idea for a metro system in Guangzhou. In 1960 he had the groundwater levels of Guangzhou checked. In 1965 Chen Yu and Tao Zhu put out the idea to build a tunnel in Guangzhou for evacuations during war or for creating a metro. The project was called "Project Nine".
The metro system was supposed to have two lines. Chen Yu planned for a north-south line and an east-west line. The plans for these lines are very similar to Line 1 and Line 2. The east-west line was never built. The north-south line was supposed to be built by Project Nine. There wasn't enough time, money, or materials so instead of having a subway, they planned to use trolleybuses. The tunnel was finished in 1966 but it could not be used. This was because there was an unsafe section of the tunnel. There were many attempts to restart Project Nine in the 1970s, but none of these attempts restarted Project Nine.
Construction of Line 1.
The metro project was started as the Preparation Office of Guangzhou Metro. It was created in 1979 to try and restart Project Nine. The project was going to help reduce the traffic in Guangzhou. Before the 1980s, most underground projects in China were to prepare for war. This was the first time that something like the Guangzhou Metro was focused on traffic. China and France worked together to design the metro. Four designs were released in the Guangzhou Daily on 14 March 1988. One of the designs were chosen after getting feedback from other people. It showed a design that would become Line 1 and Line 2.
The construction of Line 1 officially began on 28 December 1992. Before that, in October 1992, workers began on a trial part of the line. Many construction techniques were used when building the metro. They were new to China and included immersed tubes and tunnel boring machines. Line 1 needed ¥12.75 billion to be built and the city government of Guangzhou raised all the money. The mayor at the time, Li Ziliu wanted to use cut-and-cover tunnels. This meant that almost 100,000 people had to leave their homes and almost of buildings had to be destroyed.
On 28 June 1997 the section of Line 1 opened for a trial. The part that was not opened was finished on 28 December 1998. The whole line was opened for sightseeing between 16 February and 2 March 1999. Line 1 was officially opened on 28 June 1999.

Karl Davis (born January 17, 1962 in Brooklyn, NY – May 2, 1987) was an African-American fashion designer once called one of New York's most promising young designers. Davis' had six major collections, the last shown at Manhattan restaurant Caffe Roma.
Beginnings.
"Karl Davis" “Designer Files” archival materials at Fashion Institute of Technology’s research library reveal that during his teen years Davis was taught by a friend’s mother how to operate a sewing machine, and that when he was fifteen years old, he for the first time made classic, pleated slacks for himself. Davis graduated from high school in August 1980. At age 17, he left Brooklyn and began designing.
Davis attended New York’s Fashion Institute of Technology for only one semester - six months - and while there studied pattern making. He then worked as an assistant to Carol Fertig and, too, as a freelance design assistant to Bill Blass. It was while Davis was working as design assistant that he sold first styles to Henri Bendel.
During 1984, Davis established his own collection. Initially, he was financed by his supportive, fashionable mother - Rose.
Fashion Designer.
Though brief – from age 17 until shortly before his death at age 25 – Karl Davis experienced a career highly praised and of impressive achievement
"Newsweek" (10 August 1987) observed that Davis created an exclusive line of classic women’s clothing, which "New York Newsday" (4 May 1986) described as grown-up clothes not for those on a tight budget.
"New York Magazine" {17 September 1987} stated that ladies dressed in Davis-designed wardrobes would look “strong, confident, and elegant – not to mention, in many instances, frankly sexy”.
Fashion columnists of the "Dallas Morning News" (18 December 1985) reported that Davis’s work was strongly influenced by the great masters of couture, but that he managed to move forward adding his own signature of modern minimalism. The columnists, too, observed that Davis's approach to fashion and to his business were in remarkable contrast to his age.
"Taxi" (November 1986) commented that being young and having no financial backing did not intimidate Davis from creating couture clothing of the highest level; that respect should be paid to him and fashion magazine should acknowledge him and take the initiative to put him on the map; and also that a lady dressed in Davis’s clothes would not only be taken seriously, but would be praised for her good taste and silent elegance - daring to detach herself from the uniforms of a working machine. "Taxi" quoted Davis: “I love what I’m doing – making women look like women again! The lady I sell to is dressed femininely and still gains respect on a business level.” "Taxi" further observed that a customer from Henri Bendel would never suspect that the dress she just purchased was from a young designer who supported himself by making bagel sandwiches in a downtown coffee shop.
True, Davis did prepare sandwiches at “Tamala Designs With Bagel” [153 Prince Street], a SoHo clothing store with food counter in the back owned by Aggie Markowitz who reflected "[Karl] was an integral part of the downtown fashion mafia. He gave fashion commentary while he sort of made bagel sandwiches. The commentary usually came faster than the food".
"Taxi" (November 1986) quoted Davis: “Most people would rather spend money on flashy clothes that scream and spell ‘expensive’, rather than purchasing understated elegant garments".
"Prêt" (May 1986) said Davis was beginning to shake up the New York fashion scene with his elegant, dramatic cuts and sophisticated sense of style, that his designs were Inspired by the looks of Dior, Balenciaga and Chanel; and that he took a modern approach to the values and attitudes of Haute Couture and reinvented them for a new, younger generation. "Prêt" additionally observed that Davis chose to work with very basic shapes and inject something hidden or unexpected into them which he described as “classic with a twist”; that he focused primarily on playing up and enhancing the feminine form; and that to further emphasize his attention to shape, he - with a keen focus on the waist and hips for both day and evening wear - tended to stay away from loud prints and patterns and designs.
During December 1985, Davis found a backer and also was able to travel to Europe – both having significant impact on his May 1986 showing “Karl Davis Fall 1986 Collection”.
"New York Newsday" (24 August 1986) declared Davis to be “New York’s new crown prince of near couture”.
"Karl Davis" designs - priced at $80 to $500 wholesale - were sold In New York at Henri Bendel [which continued to be his major outlet], Bergdorf Goodman, Grand Hotel, Le Piccole, and Suzie's [Great Neck, NY]; in Dallas and Houston at Neiman Marcus; and in San Francisco at I. Magnin. Davis also created clothes for private clients.
Karl Davis continued designing until April 1987 – the month before his death.

1 May 1986: “Karl Davis Fall 1986 Collection” – his sixth and last formal collection - shown at Caffe Roma, a Manhattan restaurant [3 W. 18th Street]
Personal Style.
In her [Japanese] "Mr. High Fashion" (September 1986) feature article “Karl Davis: A New, Up-and-Coming Designer Who Enjoys Dressing Up”, columnist Yoko Hamada wrote concerning Davis’s stylish way of dressing that “Although many designers dress well, it hard to find someone who loves dressing up as much as Karl. He is very fond of fashion: it’s as if he was born to enjoy wearing clothes. The clothes he wears are not shockingly avant-garde or showy. Karl is a unique dresser whose taste is classic, as well as modern, neat and refined. He creates his tasteful and sophisticated look by skillfully combining brand name clothes, antiques, and ordinary garments.”
True to his nature, Davis in1980 was voted “Best Dressed Male” of his George-Wingate-High-School [Brooklyn, NY] graduating class.
Illness and Death.
On 2 May 1987, Karl Davis died of pneumonia at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY. Davis’s death was due to complications from HIV/AIDS. Along with fellow-designers Perry Ellis, Chester Weinberg, Willi Smith, Tracy Mills and Mark Pennywell, reporter Carol Hymowitz in her "Wall Street Journal" (8 December 1987) article "Designer Deaths: AIDS Is Decimating The Fashion Business . . ." cites ", , , budding talent Karl Davis, who created a line of classic women's clothing . . ." as among the enormous toll of other talents in the fashion business succumbing to an alarming surge in HIV/AIDS-related casualties.
Funeral services for Davis were held 7 May 1987 at St. Mary’s Church of Christ in Brooklyn, NY, followed by interment also in Brooklyn at Cypress Hills Cemetery.
Karl Davis was survived by his parents, Rose and Lembert Davis of Brooklyn, and three sisters, Jackie and Robin, both of Brooklyn, and Andora Boyd of Virginia.

William Wilson is a short story written by Edgar Allan Poe in 1839. 
The theme is doppelganger. The narrator is a dying man of "a noble descent" who choses not to embody a record of his later years of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime-he calls himself William Wilson because, although denouncing his profligate past, he does not accept full blame for his actions, saying that "man was never thus ... tempted before". and tells the story of how he "Fell" from "grace":Years before while attending a school in england Another boy at his school looks and acts like himself, and was even born on the same day, January 19th (Poe's actual birth day) 1813. Angered at being given "good" advice William steals into the boy bedroom but is shocked to find his double now resembles himself; he runs away from the school in horror.The first Wilson goes to the bad in life, but is haunted by his good double. After being subject to admonished at Eaton [while preparing to give a profane oath at a drinking party] and his honor destroyed at Oxford [where he is exposed at trying to cheat at cards], William is haunted by his double in subsequent years, who thwarts plans described by William as driven by ambition [in Rome], revenge [in Paris], passionate Love [in Naples], and avarice [In Egypt] and even follows him to other cities [Vienna, Berlin, Moscow]. One thing William cannot understand is that while no one knows anything about his double, his double always seems to know everything about William. At Carnival time in Rome William prepares to seduce the not unwilling young wife of a elderly nobleman. When his double appears the enraged William drags his double into a anterooom and challenges him to a sword duel where he kills the double. Distracted for a second he finds instead his double a mirror Reflected at him, he sees "mine own image, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood": apparently the dead double, "but he spoke no longer in a whisper". The narrator feels as if he is pronouncing the words: "You have conquered, and I yield. Yet, henceforward art thou also dead—dead to the World, to Heaven, and to hope! In me didst thou exist—and, in my death, see by this image, which is thine own, how utterly thou hast murdered thyself.
Poe later admitted he had got the idea from a previous story by Washington Irving about a character who kills his double.

On 27 July 1989, a Korean Air DC-10 crashed while attempting to land in Tripoli, Libya. 75 of the 199 passengers and crew on board plus 4 persons on the ground were killed in the crash.
Accident.
Flight 803 was a scheduled International passenger service from Seoul, South Korea to Tripoli, Libya with intermediate stops in Bangkok, Thailand and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. On the final approach to Tripoli, the aircraft crashed into an orchard about 1.5 miles short of the runway 27. The weather at the time of the crash consisted of heavy fog and visibility was between 100 and 800 feet.
Korean Air Flight 803 was the second aviation disaster involving a DC-10 in less than two weeks. United Airlines Flight 232 had crashed on 19 July 1989 while attempting an emergency landing in Sioux City, Iowa with 111 of the 296 people on board losing their lives.
Daewoo and Donga had multiple employees, working at construction sites of those companies' facilities, on board; they were South Korean citizens.
There were 190 South Koreans, including seven Libyans, and three Japanese nationals.
Aftermath.
After the crash Flight 803's pilot Kim Ho-jung was quoted as saying - "The airport was shrouded in dense fog and visibility was poor when I approached. I lost contact with the control tower for 15 minutes before the crash." Libya's official news agency JANA reported that a Soviet airliner one hour before Flight 803 had rerouted to Malta rather than land in the fog. Also the instrument landing system at Tripoli International Airport wasn't working at the time of the crash.
A Libyan court found the pilot and co-pilot guilty of neglect in December 1990. They were given prison sentences of two years and eighteen months respectively. In the case of the co-pilot the sentence was suspended.
Cause.
The cause of the crash was determined to be crew error in attempting a descent below decision height without the runway environment in sight.

Chlorella is a genus of single-cell green algae. It is in the division Chlorophyta. It is microscopic in size and round in shape.
"Chlorella" has in its body two green color substances: "chlorophyll-a" and "chlorophyll b." It uses photosynthesis, similar to plants which also have chlorophyll. It multiplies rapidly, needing only carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, and a small amount of minerals to reproduce.
Many people believe "Chlorella" can serve as a possible source of food and energy. This is because its photosynthesis process can, in theory, reach 8% efficiency. This is even better than that of other highly efficient crops such as sugar cane, which are already being used for food and energy.
In 1961, Melvin Calvin of the University of California received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research on the pathways of carbon dioxide assimilation using "Chlorella".
Chlorella reproduce asexually by aplanospores. A single chlorellon cell produces at least 16 non-motile aplanospores and each one of them matures into an individual unicellular alga (chlorellon) under favourable conditions. There are no any reports of sexual reproduction in Chlorella.

"Arirang" (; ) is a Korean folk song. It is sometimes thought of as the unofficial national anthem of Korea. There are almost 3,600 variations for 60 versions of the song. All of these have a part of the song similar to "Arirang, arirang, arariyo ()". People think that the song is almost 600 years old.
"Arirang" is on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list two times. This is because both South Korea and North Korea submitted the song for being included on the list. It was submitted by South Korea in 2012 and then by North Korea in 2014. The South Korean Cultural Heritage Administration added the song to its list of important intangible cultural assets in 2015.
History.
Origin.
People think that "Arirang" came from Jeongseon in the Gangwon Province of South Korea. According to a legend, the song came from the story of a man and a woman who fell in love. This was while they were picking camellia flowers. In one version of the story, the man can't cross the Auraji river because the water is too high. Because of this, they sing a song to show how sorrowful they were. In the second version of the story, the man tries to cross the Auraji and drowns. In that version, he sings the song after he dies.
Another theory says that the song came from Lady Aryeong. It says that "arin" came from the Jurchen word for "hometown" and a Chinese song called "Airang."

History.
Nanjing (then spelled "Nanking" in English) was China's capital city during the 1920s and 1930s. At that time, Japan was an empire that included Korea and Taiwan. During the 1930s, Japan started the Second Sino-Japanese War and tried to take over all of China. This became part of World War II, as Japan's friend Germany took over Poland and Italy joined their wars and started some of its own. When the Japanese army got to Nanjing in December 1937 and January 1938, it did not only fight the Chinese army; it also killed many other people who were not fighting at all. It also committed many, many war crimes against the people in the city. It is even hard to count how many people were killed or hurt in all, because the Japanese treated the bodies and the people so badly. The Chinese government says 300,000 people were killed and more were hurt.
To remember the people who were killed and hurt and to fight Japanese people who say nothing very bad happened in Nanjing, the city government built the Nanjing Massacre Museum in 1985. In 1995, with the city growing richer from China's Opening-Up Policy, the museum was made larger and better.
Grounds.
The memorial (place to remember something) consists of three major parts: a museum that shows historical records and other things from the massacre, an outdoor area, and a covered area that holds the bones of many of the people who died in the massacre. The building has about 3,000 square meters or 32,000 square feet of floor space. The rest of the museum covers another 25,000 square meters or 6 acres of land around the building. The memorial uses architecture, sculptures, and videos to show what happened during the Nanjing Massacre.
Visiting.
It is free to enter the Nanjing Massacre Museum. It is open from 8:30 to 4:30 from Tuesday to Sunday. The museum is closed every Monday.

Kamchatka Krai is one of 85 federal subjects of Russia. It is located in the Asian part of Russia. It is grouped and governed as part of the Far Eastern District. The Far Eastern District contains ten other federal subjects too.
History.
Local Koryak people lived in the region for a long time before European explorers first arrived. They were described to be war-like. In the 17th century, Russian explorers first arrived in the area. But the area's harsh climate, land and unfriendly natives made exploration difficult. Multiple fighting later broke out between the natives and the Russians throughout the 18th century. This was because the Tsar ordered more Russian explorations of the area. In 1768-1769, the smallpox disease nearly wiped out the population. The natives were finally brought under control because of the disease. In 1854, the area saw fighting between the Russians and the British and French during the Crimean War. In 1867, after the sale of Alaska to the United States, Kamchatka loss its importance. It was because travelers were no longer stopping over the area to go to Alaska. During the last months of World War II, the area became an important point for Soviet troops to invade Japan. After the war the area became a military zone. This zone was closed off to Soviet citizens till 1990 and foreigners till 1991. Today it remains as a Krai (federal subject) within Russia.
Geography.
Kamchatka is found in the far eastern part of Siberia. Because of this, it has a subarctic climate, which have long, cold winters, and short, mild summers. Rainfall in the area is unusually higher than the rest of Eastern Siberia. This is because westerly winds blow in from the Sea of Japan. The landscape is mostly mountainous, with the Sredinny Mountain Range occupying a large part of the region. The Sredinny Range has the most amount of glacier in North-East Asia. The area also has a high density of mountains that are active volcanoes. These volcanoes are included as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The area is prone to volcano eruption and earthquake. This is because it lies around the Pacific Ring of Fire. There are plenty of animals, birds and plants in the area. It is because of the good climate, geography and low human population.
Demographics.
Kamchatka's population at the end of the Soviet Union decreased for some time, according to data. It is currently increasing again. Most of the population live in cities and towns, like the capital, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Ethnic Koryaks and other natives compose of a very small percentage of the population. Russians compose a great majority of the population. Most people in Kamchatka practice Orthodox Christianity, while a sizable population are irreligious. Shamanism, which is a belief that worships spirits and nature, is still practiced by some natives in the area. Russian is taught and used commonly in Kamchatka. While native languages like Koryak, Itelmen or Chuvan are hardly taught or used at home.
Economy.
The economy of Kamchatka is mostly based on fishing and processing of natural resources. These resources include wood, coal and gold, involving the lumber and mining industries. Kamchatka lies along major shipping routes. It thus provide services such as ship building, repairing and the moving of goods among ships. In the past, Kamchatka was part of the region's fur trade. This fur trade was connected with places like China and Alaska.
Politics.
The Governor of Kamchatka is the leader of the Krai. The Governor is chosen by public vote every five years. The Kamchatka Legislative Assembly, is the Krai's parliament. The Legislative Assembly lawmakers are chosen similarly by the public every five years. The majority of lawmakers in the Legislative Assembly are currently from the United Russia party. The United Russia party is the ruling party of Russia. The Krai was formed on 1 July 2007 from the merge between Kamchatka Oblast and Koryak Autonomous Okrug.
Transportation.
Generally, Kamchatka is isolated from the rest of Russia. There are no railway and road linking it with the rest of Russia. Flying is the most convenient way of entering or leaving Kamchatka. There are several airports, like the Yelizovo Airport. Flights from these airports link Kamchatka to cities further away. However, there are no international flights into the area. Kamchatka also lies along major shipping routes. These shipping routes connect Kamchatka with Alaska and East Asia by sea.

The white currant, or whitecurrant is a cultivar of the red currant. They are flowering plants in the family Grossulaceae native to Europe. Usually, they grow as a shrub and can reach a height of about tall. The plants have palmate leaves, and masses of spherical, edible fruit (berries) in summer. The white currant differs from the red currant only in the colour and flavour of these fruits, which are a translucent white and sweeter.
It is sometimes mislabelled as "Ribes glandulosum", (which is the skunk currant in USA).
Cultivation.
Unlike their close relative the blackcurrant, red and white currants are cultivated for their ornamental value as well as their berries.
Currant bushes grow best in partial to full sunlight and can be planted between November and March in well-drained, slightly neutral to acid soil. They are relatively low-maintenance plants, but are considered cool-climate plants and fruit better in northern areas. They can also be grown in large containers.
The firm and juicy fruit are usually harvested in summer. Whole trusses of fruits should be cut instead of individual fruit, and then either used, or they can be stored in a fridge. They can also be bagged and frozen.
Various forms are known including; 'White Grape', 'Blanka' and 'Versailles Blanche' (syn ‘White Versailles’), and 'White Pearl'.
The cultivar 'White Grape' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. There are also cultivars with yellow and pink fruit, called respectively yellow currants and pink currants.
The bushes can suffer from pests such as gooseberry sawfly and birds.
Culinary uses.
White currant berries are slightly smaller and sweeter than red currants. When made into jams and jellies the result is normally pink. The white currant is actually an albino cultivar of the red currant but is marketed as a different fruit.
White currants are rarely specified in savoury cooking recipes compared with their red counterparts. They are often served raw and provide a sweetly tart flavor. White currant preserves, jellies, wines and syrups are also produced. In particular, white currants are the classic ingredient in the highly regarded Bar-le-duc or Lorraine jelly although preparations made of red currants can also be found.
The berries are a good source of vitamins C and K, and are rich in iron, copper and manganese.

Firefighting is the act of trying to prevent the spread of and put out unwanted fires. The fires can be in buildings, vehicles, woodlands, and other places. A firefighter puts out fires to protect property, people and the environment.
Firefighters usually go through a lot of technical training. This includes fighting fires in buildings, cars and the woods.
One of the major hazards with firefighting is the poisonous environment made by things burning. Four major risks are smoke, oxygen deficiency, high temperatures and poisons in the air. To protect themselves from smoke, firefighters will wear a device called a breathing apparatus.
One way to put out fires is to spray them with water. The water does two things: it vaporizes when it comes in contact with fire. The water vapor leaves the fire with less oxygen, which it needs to keep burning. The other thing water does is make things cooler. That can keep the fire from burning because things will not burn if they are not hot enough.

The Republic of Sakha also known as Yakutia is one of 85 federal subjects of Russia. It is in the Siberia area of Russia. It is grouped and governed as part of the Far Eastern District. The Far Eastern District contains ten other federal subjects too. Sakha is the largest federal subject of Russia. It stretches across three time zones between UTC+9 and UTC+11. The name Yakutia is also used to refer to the same area. The Yakut people speak a Turkic language.
History.
In the past, Yakutia was home to small groups of native tribesmen that hunt to survive. In the 13th to 14 century, the Yakuts started moving north from Lake Baikal to the area. Most of the Yakuts merged or took over the lands of these native tribesmen.
The Yakuts were different from the other tribesmen because they reared cattle, horses and practiced blacksmith skills. These skills allowed them to stay longer in one place. During the 17th century, the Russians, who were Europeans, first arrived in the region. The Yakut tribes united under the famous King Tygyn Darkhan to fight the Russians. But the Yakuts lost because they did not have guns. The Russians then brought the Yakuts under their control and continued to move eastwards. Years later, many people were punished by sending them to live in Yakutia in exile. This was because Yakutia was far from most places. Between 1921 and 1923, during the Russian Civil War, the area was the last land remaining under the control of the White Russians. The area was eventually brought under the control of the Bolsheviks's Red Army. This event was known as the Yakut Revolt.
Under Stalin's rule, several gulags were opened in the area. These gulags were used to house the growing forced labour population. These labourers were brought in to mine the gold minerals to pay for the Soviet Union's industrialization. After the Soviet Union collapsed, Yakutia was given the name Republic of Sakha and continues to be a republic in Russia.
Geography.
Sakha is in the north part of Eastern Siberia. Because Sakha is very big, it experiences both polar tundra and subarctic climate. Both climates have long, cold winters, and short, mild summers. There is not a lot of rainfall in the area because of the climate. The tundra climate makes the northern part of Sakha empty and mostly frozen. The subarctic climate allows the southern part of Sakha to have taiga type of forests.
These forests have many animals and birds. There are several mountain ranges around Sakha as well. The Lena Pillars are rock structures found in Sakha. The Lena Pillars are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The region is also rich in minerals like diamond, gold, and coal. The area is also famous for its extreme temperatures. For example during winter the temperature can go to as low as and during summer as high as .
Demographics.
Sakha's population at the end of the Soviet Union decreased for some time according to data. It is currently increasing again. More than half of the population live in cities and towns. Most that do so live in the capital, Yakutsk. Ethnic Yakuts who are Turkic people compose of about half of the population. Russians mostly make up the other half of the population. Most people in Sakha practice Orthodox Christianity or are atheists. Certain aspects of Shamanism, which is a belief that worships spirits and nature, is still practiced by ethnic Yakuts. In recent times, more natives have shown increasing interest in practicing Shamanism. Russian is taught and used commonly in Sakha. But the Yakut language is still commonly used between different native tribes, that are not Yakuts, to talk to one another. Yakut is also taught in some schools and is also used at home.
Culture.
The Olonkho is a famous Yakut tale about great people and animals. It talks about legends and present day issues like the breaking apart of Yakut families. It is only performed by experts who have learn the tale thoroughly. This is because the tale is very long. The tale is part of the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This means that the tale is widely accepted to be important and needs to prevented from being forgotten.
The Republic Day is celebrated on April 27 every year. It celebrates the formation of Yakut ASSR during the Soviet Union in 1922. The Yhy�kh festival is celebrated between 10 and 25 June every year. It is one of two New Year's Day celebrated by the Yakut people. The other being the more recognized New Year's Day in January. It is celebrated to mark the start of the short summer.
Economy.
The economy of Sakha mostly relies on the mining of minerals like diamonds, gold, tin and coal. It is the region's largest producer of minerals and raw materials. Sakha also produces 99% of Russia's diamonds. This accounts for about 25% of the world's diamond output. The making of construction materials, jewellery and medicine are also major industries in Sakha. In contrast, the native Yakut people rear cattle and horses or hunt and fish to provide for themselves as well.
Politics.
The Head of Sakha is the leader of the republic. The Head is chosen by public vote every five years. The Il Tumen (Legislative Assembly), is the republic's parliament. The Il Tumen are chosen similarly by the public every five years. The majority of lawmakers in the Il Tumen are currently from the United Russia party. The United Russia party is the ruling party of Russia.
Transportation.
Sakha lies north of the important Trans-Siberian railway and Trans-Siberian Highway. Thus there is some distance between the republic and the main travelling routes across the country. The main road link in Sakha is the Lena Highway towards the south or the Kolyma Highway towards the east. The roads can generally be passed all year round, except across the Lena River where there is no bridge. Therefore, cars have to take a ferry across the river during summer or drive on the ice in winter. The Amur-Yakutsk train line connects Sakha with the rest of the Trans-Siberian railway. The republic has several airports, including the Yakutsk International Airport. Flights from these airports link Sakha to cities further away. The usage of the Northern Sea Route to transport goods is also possible at certain times of the year.

Congressional districts in the United States are electoral divisions for electing members of the United States House of Representatives. There are now 435 voting seats in the House of Representatives. Each seat represents around 761,000 people. There have been 435 voting seats since 1913, except for a temporary increase to 437 after the admissions of Alaska and Hawaii. The total number of state members is capped by the "Reapportionment Act of 1929". Also, each of the five inhabited U.S. territories and the federal district of Washington, D.C. sends a non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives.
The Bureau of the Census counts the number of people in the United States every ten years. This is called the decennial census. The numbers from the Census are used to figure out how many representavies each state gets. This is called "apportionment". The 2012 elections were the first to be based on the congressional districts which were defined based on the 2010 United States Census.
Each state is in charge of the redistricting of districts within their state, and several states have one "at-large" division. Redistricting must take place if the number of members changes after a reapportionment, or may take place at any other time if demographics represented in a district has changed substantially. Districts may sometimes retain the same boundaries while changing their district numbers.
The following is a complete list of the 435 current congressional districts for the House of Representatives, and over 200 obsolete (no longer being used) districts, and the six current and one obsolete non-voting delegations.

Sentientism is a way of thinking about what is right and wrong - an ethical philosophy. It uses evidence of the real world and careful thinking to develop beliefs. It rejects beliefs where there is no good evidence for them. Sentientism says we should care about all sentient beings and care more about beings that are more sentient.
Sentient beings include anything that can experience good or bad things or feelings. These include humans, most non-human animals and may eventually include artificial beings we create or intelligent aliens we meet.
People who agree with sentientism are called sentientists. They are atheist and often humanist. They are also often vegan or vegetarian for moral reasons.
Things that are not sentient, such as plants, rivers and mountains, may be important because they affect how sentient beings feel. However, we don't need to care about them directly because they cannot suffer or feel pleasure.
Sentientist thinking has a long history, from Jeremy Bentham's An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation through to modern philosophers such as Richard D. Ryder and Peter Singer.
Sentientism differs from Speciesism because it uses degrees of sentience, rather than species, to decide what things we should care about.
Sentientism differs from painism because it counts positive experience, as well as the ability to feel pain, in making moral decisions.
Sentientism agrees with Animalism that humans are animals so we should care about both. However, sentientism argues that we should also care about non-animal sentient beings, such as potential artificial or alien intelligences.
Notable Sentientists.
Notable sentientists include: Thandie Newton, Bill Maher, James Cameron, Stephen Fry, George Meyer, Ricky Gervais, Sam Harris, Benjamin Spock, Oliver Sykes, Steven Pinker, Gary Holt (musician), Ellen Page, Kristen Bell, Cloris Leachman, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Richard Dawkins, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Jessica Lange and John Stewart Bell.
In some cases sentientism is implied because these people are atheists and/or humanists and vegans or vegetarians.

A spin valve is a device that consists of two metallic magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic spacer whose electric resistance can change depending on the relative alignment of magnetization in the two magnetic layers, electrons moving through a non-magnetic material normally have random spins, so the net effect is cancelled out. When the magnetization of both the magnetic material are in the same direction or parallel, the resistance in the sandwiched layer becomes low so that the electrons in that layer have spins all aligned in one direction - either all up or all down, allowing a new way to store binary data in the form of one's (all spins up) and zeroes (all spins down).

Appearance.
Adult males of the Japanese weasel can reach in body length with a tail length of up to . Females are smaller. The fur is orange-brown with darker markings.
Distribution and Habitat.
The Japanese weasel was na­tive to three of Japan’s four larger is­lands: Hon­shu, Kyushu, and Shikoku. Over the past cen­tury, they have been intro­duced to most other Japan­ese is­lands to control the population of rodents. Their range now in­cludes Hokkaidō and the many of the Ryūkyū Islands.
Japan­ese weasels are found in a lot of ecosystems in Japan. It mainly lives in moun­tain­ous and forested places near mov­ing water. Most hunt­ing is done along rivers, but these weasels sometimes go into grasslands or sub­ur­ban areas.
In win­ter, these slim weasels spend most of their time under the snow chas­ing small ro­dents through a maze of tunnels. After catch­ing and eat­ing the prey, Japan­ese weasels usually enjoy the warmth of the prey's nest after eat­ing.
Feeding.
They eat mice, frogs, reptiles, insects and crayfish. They sometimes eat berries, seeds and fruits but only when hungry. Males like to eat more mammals and crustacean. Females like to eat insects, fruits and earthworms.
Their diet changes depending on the season, the number of some foods. Fish and insects are a part of their diet throughout all seasons. They mostly eat coleoptera insects in spring, fruits in summer, orthoptera insects and crustaceans in autumn and fish and fruit in winter. Japanese weasels help in controlling rodent and other small animal populations.
Behavior.
Japanese weasels live by themselves, with the except when mating, and raising the young ones. They do not like other Japanese weasels entering their home range and will defend their home range. When scared, weasels release musk to discourage predators.
Japanese weasels are also great hunters. They chase down prey by any means, including running down tunnels, climbing trees, or swimming. Anywhere prey can go, the weasel can follow. They are both diurnal and nocturnal.
Reproduction.
The mating season is from early May to late June. After mating, gestation takes about 30 days. The number of kits varies from 2 to 12, but is usually 5 or 6. It takes 8 weeks to fully be weaned and live by themselves. Japanese weasels are sexually mature at one year old.
Breeding season is twice a year in Kyushu, once a year in Hokkaido.
Economic importance.
In the past century Japanese weasels have been introduced to many small Japanese islands to kill rats that were damaging crops. Together with the use of some rodenticide, the weasels helped reduce rat populations. Japanese weasels are also trapped and used in the fur trade. Japanese weasels also sometimes hunt domestic birds, such as chickens and ducks.
Conservation status.
Although their populations are in slight decline, Japanese weasels are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List because of their widespread population across Japan. The main threat to Japanese weasels is habitat loss because of residential and commercial development.

In computer science, a while loop is a statement which is used to execute code repeatedly based on a condition. Simply, it can be thought of as a repeating if statement.  
Overview.
The while loop consists of two parts: the condition and a block of code. The condition is evaluated and if it is true, the block of code is executed. This repeats until the condition evaluates to false. As a pre-test loop, the while loop checks the condition before the block is executed. In contrast, the do-while loop checks the condition "after" the loop has executed. A while loop would typically be used when you don't know the number of times you would like to loop over the block of code. Instead, code would continue looping until a particular condition is met. When the number of times a loop is to be executed is already known before the execution of the loop, a for loop would be a better choice. 
A template of a while loop is shown below:
while (condition) 
 statements;
Example.
Example code in the C programming language is shown below.
int x = 0;
while (x &lt; 5) 
 printf ("x = %d\n", x);
 x++;
In this example, the loop first checks to see if the variable x is less than 5. Because it is, it will enter the loop, printing the value of x and then increment x by 1. After completing the code block, it will continue to repeat the code block until x is equal to 5. When x is equal to five, the condition evaluates to false and the code exits the while loop. A loop that continues repeating forever is possible if the condition is always true. When this happens, it is up to the developer to create a statement to exit the loop. An example of this is shown below:  
while (true) 
 //do complicated stuff
 if (someCondition) break;
 //more stuff
In the above example, the condition while always be true. To exit the loop, a break statement is used when a specific condition inside the loop evaluates to true.

The Bogosort is considered one of the worst sorting algorithms. It works by creating random arrangements of given values and randomly moving them until they are sorted. It is not effective for any form of sorting.
Algorithm.
The Bogosort first takes in a set of values from a user. Next it randomly arranges these values.
If the values are now in a sorted order, then the function is finished, else the function repeats itself.
A working analogy for the Bogosort is to sort a deck of cards by throwing them into the air, picking them up at random, and repeating the process until they are sorted.
Simple Example.
Array = (3,1 ,5 ,7 ,8 ,9)
1st shuffling = (1,3,7,8,9,5)
2nd shuffling = (3,7,8,6,9,1)
3rd shuffling = (7,6,3,8,9,1)
4th shuffling = (6,7,8,9,3,1)
5th shuffling = (3,6,7,8,9,1)
(continued shuffling) ...
Coding Example.
The following code is done in Python 3:
import random 
def is_sorted(data): 
 for i in range(len(data) - 1): 
 if data[i] &gt; data[i + 1]:
 return False
 return True
def bogosort(data):
 while not is_sorted(data): 
 random.shuffle(data)
 return data

Procedural animation refers to rule-based or algorithmic methods of creating computer graphics animation.
Procedural animation vs. traditional animation.
With traditional animation method, principal animation poses are specified by an animator at a specific point in the animation timeline. By setting these poses, an animator can artistically direct how the geometry will be framed in some key events. These poses are in the same sense as how a person may pose for a photography session. Shapes and objects in computer graphics are considered as "geometry". With key events specified, the animation software will then automatically fill the intermediary motions between key points, thereby creating continuous motion throughout the timeline without requiring additional works by an animator.
"Procedural animation" is a rule-base approach to creating animations. These rules are typically some form of mathematical or statistical functions which tell the animation software how an object is to be animated. In order for the geometry to be animated, these functions typically require some form of time-based variable as its input. Therefore, one can apply a chain of logical rules and algorithms to create animations without manually specify any key poses.
Procedural modeling.
In computer graphics, "modeling" refers to an act of digitally sculpting a model. P"rocedural modeling" then refers to same rule-based, algorithmic approach to creating geometry. Procedural modeling differs from procedural animation in that a time-based variable is not required.
Proceduralism.
Amongst some animators within the computer graphics industry, procedural modeling and animation method is also known as "proceduralism".
Advantages and disadvantages of proceduralism.
In order to maximize artistic impact of their craft, animators employ traditional animation techniques to set poses manually at a specific point in time. When the objects to be animated become significantly more complex, traditional animation techniques may not be feasible. Therefore, "proceduralism" offers significant advantage as complexities increase significantly. While "proceduralism" enables its practitioners to create infinite variation of models and animations, specific key pose is often left as random chance. Computer graphics animators must decide between the combinations of both techniques in order to achieve the desired outcome.
Applications of procedural animation.
"Procedural animation" is used extensively in visual effects for movie and gaming industry where animation data and geometry must be generated with certain random probability in order to simulate the physical world.

User interface design (UI) or user interface engineering is the design of our machines and software interface such as the interface of your computer, printer, phones, etc. It helps the user interact with the system in order to increase the user experience and enhance efficiency.
Good user interface never draws useless attention and always finish the tasks first. A good format can help the user perform right interactions and a good graphic design can help the user focus on the function in the system. During the design process, we must balance the functions and visual effects to create a stable, adaptable, and functional system for users.
Interface design is applied in many different areas such as computers, to cars, to planes. Even though most of these areas have similar human interactions, we still need special skills to accomplish the design goals. That is why designers are usually specialized in some areas than others in order to make the best efforts out of themselves.
Standards of user interface design have been developed in 1980s for defining the usability of software products.

Digital audio is sound which has been turned into a computer file. Digital audio files can be played on MP3 players, computers, smartphones, and more. Digital audio may be uncompressed, such as CDs or WAV files, losslessly compressed, such as FLAC files, or lossily compressed, such as MP3 files. Audio is converted to digital format using a device called an analog to digital converter (ADC). The ADC takes samples of the amplitude of the signal at a specific sample rate (for example, 44100 times per second). These samples are binary numbers. When converting back to analog, a device called a digital to analog converter (DAC) recreates the original analog signal that matches the given samples.

Wells Cathedral is an Anglican church in Wells, Somerset, England. It is the seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells. Its construction started in 1170 and the Cathedral was dedicated in 1239. 
Wells Cathedral has been described as “the most poetic of the English Cathedrals”. 
Much of the structure is in Early English architecture. Many mouldings look almost like sculptures. The carved capitals are done in a foliate style known as “stiff leaf”. This adds to their lively view. The eastern end has kept much original glass, which is rare in England. The exterior has a splendid Early English façade (~front) and a large central tower.
The first church was established on the site in 705. Construction of the present building began in the 10th century under Anglo-Saxon rule, but was later transformed under the Normans. It was largely complete at the time of its dedication in 1239. It has been expanded and renovated several times since then and has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building.
History of the building.
Early years.
The first church was established here in 705 AD. It was dedicated to Saint Andrew. The only remains of this first church are some excavated foundations which can be seen in the cloisters. The baptismal font in the south transept is the oldest surviving part of the cathedral which is dated to c.700 AD.
Two centuries later, the seat of the diocese was shifted to Wells from Sherborne. The first Bishop of Wells was Athelm (circa 909), who crowned King Athelstan. Athelm and his nephew Saint Dunstan both became Archbishops of Canterbury. It was also around this time that Wells Cathedral School was founded.
Present structure.
The present structure was begun under the direction of Bishop Reginald de Bohun, who died in 1184.
Wells Cathedral dates mainly from the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries; the nave and transept are masterpieces of Early English architecture. It was largely complete at the time of its dedication in 1239.
The bishop responsible for the construction was Jocelyn de Wells, one of the bishops at the signing of Magna Carta. Jocelyn's buildings included the Bishop's Palace, a choristers' school, a grammar school, a hospital for travellers and a chapel. He also built a manor at Wookey, near Wells. The master mason associated with Jocelyn was Elias of Dereham (died 1246). Jocelyn lived to see the church dedicated but, despite much lobbying of Rome, died in 1242. Cathedral status was granted in 1245. Masons continued with the enrichment of the West Front until about 1260.
King John was excommunicated between 1209 and 1213. During this time, work on the cathedral was suspended. In this period, building methods advanced so that bigger blocks of masonry could be moved and put into the walls. The effect of this advance can be seen on the walls of the cathedral; at a point in the building's walls, the blocks of stone increase in size.
By the time the building was finished, including the Chapter House (1306),
it already seemed too small for the developing liturgy, in particular the increasingly grand processions. A new spate of building was therefore started by Bishop John Drokensford. He heightened the central tower and began a dramatic eight-sided Lady chapel at the far east end, finished by 1326. Thomas of Whitney was the master mason.
Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury followed. He continued the eastward extension of the quire. He also built Vicars' Close and the Vicars' Hall, to give the men of the choir a secure place to live and dine, away from the town with all its temptations.
He enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the citizens of Wells, partly because of his imposition of taxes. He surrounded his palace with crenellated walls and a moat and drawbridge. The Palace was now a castle.
The appointment of William Wynford as master mason in 1365 marked another period of activity. He was one of the foremost architects of his time and, apart from Wells, was engaged in work for the king at Windsor and at New College, Oxford University and Winchester Cathedral. Under Bishop John Harewell, he built the south-west tower of the West Front and designed the north west, which was built to match in the early 15th century. Inside the building he filled in the early English lancet windows with delicate tracery.
In the fourteenth century, the central piers (upright supports) of the crossing (where the building forms a cross) started sinking under the weight of the crossing tower. 'Scissor arches' were inserted to brace and stabilize the piers as a unit. The building was now complete, and it looked much as it does today.

Caen ( pronounced "can" (/kɑ�/);) is a city in France. It is the capital city of Basse-Normandie and Calvados. The river Orne flows through it. Today, about 110,000 people live there ("intra muros", inside the city); the urban area has about 370,000 people. The city has a very long history; the name probably has Gaulish origins (from "cato" Military activity; and "mago" field; probably something like "place where the troops exercised"). A campus of the École de management de Normandie is in the city.

Strasbourg Cathedral or the Cathedral of Our Lady of Strasbourg (, or "Cathédrale de Strasbourg", or "Straßburger Münster"), also known as Strasbourg Minster, is a cathedral. The cathedral was built in Gothic style. The belltower is 142 m high. It was the highest building in the world from 1647 to 1874. It is currently the second-highest cathedral in France, after Rouen Cathedral, which is 9m higher, at 151m. In 1880, Cologne Cathedral was finished (157m), and later Ulm minster (at 161m), the highest Cathedral in the World. 
Considerable parts of it are still in Romanesque architecture. Nevertheless, it is widely considered to be among the finest examples of high, or late, Gothic architecture. Erwin von Steinbach is credited for major contributions from 1277 to his death in 1318.
Victor Hugo described it as a "gigantic and delicate marvel". The cathedral is visible far across the plains of Alsace and can be seen from as far off as the Vosges mountains or the Black Forest on the other side of the Rhine.
An Al-Qaeda plot to bomb the adjacent Christmas market was prevented in 2000 by French and German police.

Exeter Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in the city of Exeter, Devon, in the southwest of England. It is the seat of the Bishop of Exeter. The present building was complete by about 1400, and has the longest uninterrupted vaulted ceiling in England, and other notable features. The cathedral is built in Gothic style.
History.
In 1107, William Warelwast, a nephew of William the Conqueror, was appointed to the see, and this was the catalyst for the building of a new cathedral in the Norman style. Its official foundation was in 1133, after Warelwast's time, but it took many more years to complete. In 1258 the building was already outmoded, and it was rebuilt in the Decorated English Gothic architecture style, following the example of nearby Salisbury Cathedral. However, much of the Norman building was kept, including the two massive square towers and part of the walls. It was constructed entirely of local stone, including Purbeck Marble. The new cathedral was complete by about 1400, apart from the addition of the chapter house and chantry chapels.
World War II.
On 4 May 1942, an early morning air raid took place over Exeter. The cathedral sustained a direct hit by a large high-explosive bomb on the chapel of St James, completely demolishing it. The muniment room above, three bays of the aisle and two flying buttresses were also destroyed in the blast. The medieval wooden screen opposite the chapel was smashed into many pieces by the blast, but it has been reconstructed and restored. Fortunately many of the cathedral's most important artifacts, such as the glass of the great east window, the misericords, the Exeter Book, the bishop's throne and the Bronescombe Effigy, had been removed at the start of the war in anticipation of such an attack. Subsequent repairs and the clearance of the area around the western end of the building uncovered portions of earlier structures, including remains of the Roman city and of the original Norman cathedral.
Astronomical clock.
The clock is one of a group of famous 14th to 16th century astronomical clocks to be found in the West of England. Another one is at Wells Cathedral.
The main, lower, dial is the oldest part of the clock, dating from 1484. The fleur-de-lys 'hand' indicates the time (and the position of the sun in the sky) on a 24-hour analogue dial. The numbering consists of two sets of I-XII Roman numerals. The silver ball and inner dial shows both the age of the moon and its phase (using a rotating black shield to indicate the moon's phase). The upper dial, added in 1760, shows the minutes.
The Latin phrase "Pereunt et Imputantur", a favourite motto for clocks and sundials was written by the Latin poet Martial. It is usually translated as "they perish and are reckoned to our account", referring to the hours that we spend, wisely or not. The original clockwork mechanism was much modified, repaired, and neglected until it was replaced in the early 20th century. The door below the clock has a round hole near its base. This was cut in the early 17th century to allow entry for the Bishop's cat to deter vermin. The vermin were attracted to the animal fat used to lubricate the clock mechanism.

Purbeck marble is a fossiliferous limestone found in the Isle of Purbeck, a peninsula in south-east Dorset, England. It has been quarried since at least Roman times as a decorative building stone. This industry is no longer active.
Geology.
These limestone beds were deposited during Lower Cretaceous epoch. Purbeck Marble is not a metamorphic rock, like a true marble, but is so-called because it can take a fine polish.
Its characteristic appearance comes from densely-packed shells of the freshwater snail "Viviparus". Sussex Marble is similar in type. The 'marble' large clasts (the snail shells) in a fine-grained limestone mud matrix.
The individual marble beds (also known as 'seams'), lie between layers of softer marine clays and mudstone, laid down during repeated marine ingressions. Some of the beds contain iron oxide/hydroxide minerals, such as haematite or limonite, giving red or brown varieties, while other beds contain glauconite giving a green (or occasionally blue) colour.
Occurrence.
Purbeck marble is found at outcrop, or beneath superficial cover, all the way across the Isle of Purbeck. The marble beds are never more than 1.2 m thick and are often much thinner. The outcrops lie within the Purbeck Monocline, with the beds dipping moderately steeply to the north.

Killa Abdullah or Qilla Abdullah or Abdullah Qilla () is a district in the northwest of the Balochistan province of Pakistan.

The Holy Grail is an artifact from Christians beliefs. According to a story, it is the cup or plate used by Jesus at the Last Supper. It was later used to catch his blood when he had to die on the cross.
According to the story, it has special powers. Many stories of the Arthurian Legend are about the Holy Grail. The first to write about it was Chrétien de Troyes. The legend may combine Christian lore with a Celtic myth of a cauldron which has special powers.
The connection of Joseph of Arimathea with the Grail legend dates from Robert de Boron's "Joseph d'Arimathie". In the story, Joseph receives the Grail from an apparition of Jesus Christ, and sends it with his followers to Great Britain; building upon this theme, later writers told how Joseph used the Grail to catch Christ's blood while burying him and that in Britain he founded a line of guardians to keep it safe.
A cup that could have been the Holy Grail can be seen in Valencia Cathedral.
The term "Holy Grail" is often used as a metaphor for something very important or special.

Kathua district () is one of 14 administrative districts in the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is surrounded by Jammu to the northwest, the Doda District and Udhampur District districts to the north, the state of Himachal Pradesh to the east, Punjab to the south in the Republic of India. Its terrain is diverse, consisting of rich agricultural areas along the Pakistani border, plains sweeping eastward to the foothills of the Himalaya, and a mountainous Pahari region in the east.
Kathua district is divided into 8 blocks:Bani, Barnoti, Basholi, Billawar, Duggan, Ghagwal, Hiranagar, Kathua and Lohai Malhar. It has approximately 587 villages.
The traditional language of Kathua is Dogri, a dialect of Punjabi. The Pahari Punjabi is prevalent in the mountainous area of the east. The principal media of education are Hindi, and Punjabi.
In a Muslim majority state, Kathua, like the Jammu region, is overwhelmingly Hindu, the religion practiced by 75% of its district population. Another 12% is Muslim, and 10% Sikh.
A relatively safe regional pocket, Kathua was spared the decade-long insurrection sparked by the Khalistan separatist movement in Punjab that ended in the early 1990s, just to its south, and the ongoing Freedom movement in Kashmir Valley farther to the north, beginning in the 1980s.

Manorialism (Seigneurialism) is the name for the organization of the economy in the Middle Ages in Europe. The economy relied mainly on agriculture. Manorialism describes how land was distributed and who profited from the land.
A lord received a piece of land, usually from a higher nobleman, or from the king. When he got the land, he also received all that was on it. Most of the people that lived on the land also belonged to him. The nobleman could live and support his family from what he received from the peasants. He had also certain legal powers, like that of a police force. The peasants were commoners or subjects and had to pay tribute to the lord. In return they received protection. 
The tribute the subjects had to pay varied. It could be money but subsistence farming meant most had no money. They could pay by doing work for their lord, or pay a certain part of what they earned (like "one tenth"). That meant that if they grew a crop such as some form of corn, the lord got a tenth of what they grew. This is also called "payment in nature" or sharecropping.
Common features.
Manors each had up to three different classes of land: 
Sometimes the lord had a mill, a bakery or a wine-press. This could be used by the peasants if they paid. Similarly, the right to hunt or to let pigs feed in his woodland was subject to a fee. The peasants could use the lord's legal system to settle their disputes - for a fee. Single payments were due on each change of tenant. On the other side of the account, manorial administration involved significant expenses. This might be one of the reasons why smaller manors tended to rely less on villein tenure. 
Dependent holdings were held by agreement of lord and tenant. Tenure was usually hereditary, with a payment made to the lord on each succession of another member of the family. Villein land could not be abandoned, at least not as long as every fleeing peasant was likely to starve to death; nor could they be passed to a third party without the lord's permission, and the customary payment. 
Though not free, villeins were definitely not slaves: they enjoyed legal rights, subject to local custom, and had recourse to the law, subject to court charges which were an additional source of manorial income. Sub-letting of villein holdings was common, and labour on the demesne might be changed into an additional money payment, as happened increasingly from the 13th century. 
This description of a manor house at Chingford, Essex in England was recorded in a document for the Chapter of St Paul's Cathedral when it was granted to Robert Le Moyne in 1265:
Variation among manors.
Feudal society was based on two principles, that of feudalism and manorialism. 
Not all manors had all three kinds of land: as an average, demesne accounted for roughly a third of the arable area and villein holdings rather more; but some manors had only demesne land, others had only peasant holdings. Similarly, the proportion of unfree and free tenures could vary greatly. This meant that the amount of wage labour to perform agricultural work on the demesne varied as well. The proportion of the cultivated area in demesne tended to be greater in smaller manors. The share of villein land was greater in large manors, providing the lord with a larger potential supply of labour for demesne work. The proportion of free tenements was less variable, but tended to be greater on the smaller manors. 
Manors varied also in their geographical arrangement. Most were not a single village. Often, parts of two or more villages belonged to the manor, or were shared between several manors. In those places, peasants living far from the lord's estate sometimes paid cash instead of working for the lord. 
The demesne was usually not a single plot of land. It consisted of some land around the central house and estate buildings. The rest of the demesne land was in the form of strips all around the manor. The lord might lease free tenements belonging to neighbouring manors, as well as holding other manors some distance away to provide a greater range of produce. 
Not all manors were held by laymen lords who did military service or paid cash to their superior. An English survey done in 1086 estimates that 17% belonged directly to the king, and more than a quarter were held by bishops and monasteries. These church manors were usually larger, with a significantly greater villein area than the lay manors next to them. 
The effect of circumstances on manorial economy is complex and at times contradictory: upland conditions have been seen as tending to preserve peasant freedoms (livestock husbandry is less labour-intensive and therefore less demanding of villein services); on the other hand, some such areas of Europe have been said to show some of the most oppressive manorial conditions, while lowland eastern England is credited with an exceptionally large free peasantry, in part a legacy of Scandinavian settlement.
The spread of money economy is often seen as having stimulated the replacement of labour services by money payments, but the growth of the money supply and resulting inflation after 1170 initially led nobles to take back leased estates and to re-impose labour dues as the value of fixed cash payments was less in real terms.
Historical development and geographical distribution.
Today, the term is used most to refer to medieval Western Europe. A similar system was used in the rural parts of the late Roman Empire. The birthrate and population were declining. Labor was therefore the most important factor for production. Successive administrations tried to stabilise the imperial economy by freezing the social structure into place: sons were to succeed their fathers in their trade.
Councillors were forbidden to resign, and "coloni", the cultivators of land, were not to move from the demesne they were attached to. They were on their way to becoming serfs. Several factors conspired to merge the status of former slaves and former free farmers into a dependent class of such "coloni". Laws of Constantine I around 325 reinforced both the negative semi-servile status of the "coloni" and limited their rights to sue in the courts. Their numbers were increased by barbarian "foederati" who were permitted to settle within the imperial boundaries.
As the Germanic kingdoms succeeded Roman authority in the West in the fifth century, Roman landlords were often simply replaced by Gothic or Germanic ones, with little change to the situation. The process of rural self-sufficiency was given an abrupt boost in the 8th century, when normal trade in the Mediterranean Sea was disrupted. Henri Pirenne'si dea disputed by many, supposes that the Arab conquests forced the medieval economy into even greater ruralisation and gave rise to the classic feudal pattern of varying degrees of servile peasantry underpinning a hierarchy of localised power centres.

This is a list of colleges and universities who play hockey in Atlantic Hockey:
UConn will leave the conference in July 2014 to join Hockey East. Its women's hockey team is already a member of that conference.

College Hockey America (CHA) is a group of American colleges and universities who play NCAA Division I women's ice hockey against one another every season. It was founded in 1999 as a men's hockey conference, with women's teams joining in 2002. The men's side of CHA folded after the 2009–10 season. As of the current 2013–14 season, CHA has six members, which is the minimum needed to earn an automatic place in the NCAA women's tournament. However, because three of these schools only joined in July 2012, CHA will not get an automatic tournament place until at least the 2014–15 season.
CHA has close ties with Atlantic Hockey, a men's hockey-only conference. Although the conferences do not share offices, they have the same commissioner, and three current CHA members are also in Atlantic Hockey.
Current members.
Of the current members, Mercyhurst, RIT, and Robert Morris have varsity men's teams in Atlantic Hockey. Penn State has a men's varsity team that plays in the school's all-sports conference, the Big Ten. Syracuse has a men's team, but it plays at club level, outside the NCAA structure.

Hockey East is a group of American colleges and universities who play NCAA Division I hockey against one another every season. Before the Notre Dame men's hockey team (in Indiana) joined in 2013, all of the members were in New England. The champions are automatically invited to the NCAA Division I men's and women's hockey tournaments.
In all, 12 schools are members of Hockey East. Seven of these have men's and women's teams that both play in the conference. Four do not have a women's team playing at the NCAA level, although one of these four will move its women's club team to the NCAA level in 2015. One school has its women's team only in Hockey East, with its men's team in another conference.
The current members are listed below. Unless otherwise noted, these schools have both men's and women's teams in the conference.
In July 2014, Connecticut, now a member only for women's hockey, will move its men's team into Hockey East. One year later, Merrimack, a member in men's hockey only, will upgrade its women's team from club to full varsity status and move that team into the conference.

He was with the company from 2002 to 2019. In 2018, he was added to the Impact Hall of Fame by his longtime manager, James Mitchell.
Career.
Ring of Honor (2004 - 2006).
Abyss first appeared in Ring of Honor (ROH) in 2004. He was a bodyguard in the stable Special K. Abyss appeared only once because TNA pulled all of their wrestlers from ROH.
Abyss returned in the summer of 2005. This time, he was a member of Prince Nana's stable, The Embassy. They were fighting with Generation Next. This lasted for the rest of 2005. There were several matches and fights between both teams. The feud ended in a Steel Cage Warfare match at December's "Steel Cage Warfare". In the match, Abyss teamed with Alex Shelley, Jimmy Rave and Prince Nana to take on Austin Aries, Roderick Strong, Jack Evans and Matt Sydal. Abyss was eliminated by Jack Evans. Generation Next won the match and the feud.
In January 2006, Abyss teamed with Embassy members Jimmy Rave and Alex Shelley to wrestle in the Trios Tournament. They won the tournament. This meant that all three of its winning members had won a chance to wrestle for the World Championship. Abyss left ROH before this happened.
Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2003 - 2019).
Parks was on TNA's first show using the ring name "Justice". He took part in a gauntlet match for the new NWA World Heavyweight Championship. He did not win the match. Parks returned to TNA as "The Monster Abyss" in June 2003. He started by attacking Jeff Hardy. His feud with Hardy did not last long. Hardy had been suspended before their their first match. Parks was used as a bodyguard to Kid Kash. He was an ally to Kash until October, when Kash yelled at Abyss for losing a match. This caused Abyss to attack Kash. Abyss won a match against Kash, but then lost a First Blood Steel Chair on a Pole match to him. The feud between the two ended soon after the match.
In 2004, Abyss had his first major feud with A.J. Styles. On one show, Abyss was forced to team with Styles in a NWA World Tag Team Championship match. Abyss left Styles near the beginning of the match but they still won. Abyss defeated Styles on the next show. On the show after that, he got control of the titles by winning a Four Corners Tables match against Styles. Later, the titles were taken away from Abyss. On the next show, they wrestled in a Falls Count Anywhere match. Neither of them won the match. The next show had Abyss win against Styles in a Ladder match to become the top contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Abyss lost the right to Raven in a match that also involved Styles and Ron Killings.
About a month later, Abyss got a new manager, Goldy Locks. She used Abyss to win the contract of her ex-boyfriend Erik Watts. She kept using Abyss to win contracts for her. She also added Alex Shelley to her group to help them win the title. Goldy Locks treated Shelley very good but treated Abyss poorly. Watts returned for revenge. Abyss, Shelley, and Goldy Locks wrestled against Watts, Sonny Siaki and Desire. During the match, Abyss turned on his team. He attacked Goldy Locks and left match and her.
Not long after separating from Goldy Locks, Abyss began to feud with Monty Brown and Raven. This led to the first ever Monster's Ball match at TNA's first monthly pay per view, Victory Road. At Victory Road, Brown won the match when he pinned Raven. Abyss and Brown continued to feud in a match at Turning Point. Brown won the match.

Kirby's Adventure, called Hoshi no Kabi: Yume no Izumi no Monogatari "Kirby of the Stars: The Story of the Fountain of Dreams" in Japan, is a platform video game made by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System game console. It was remade for the Game Boy Advance as "".
Plot.
After waking up without dreams, Kirby goes to the Fountain of Dreams to investigate. In doing so, he learns that King Dedede has stole the Star Rod, by splitting it into seven pieces and giving six fragments to his allies and keeping one himself. Without the Star Rod, all of the inhabitants of Dream Land became restless and cannot dream. Kirby retrieves all fragments, in order to restore the rod and the dreams.
Kirby travels throughout seven worlds, defeating most enemies in order to collect the fragments. Once Kirby defeats King Dedede and rebuilds the Star Rod, he places it back into the Fountain of Dreams. However, an ominous black aura fills the skies as a dark creature named Nightmare emerges from the fountain. It turns out that Nightmare had corrupted the Star Rod, and King Dedede broke it with the intention of protecting Dream Land. Nightmare then flies off into space, and King Dedede inhales Kirby and the Star Rod and spits them into the air. Kirby uses the Star Rod to defeat both forms of Nightmare, and saves Dream Land once again.
Gameplay.
The player can get to the end of each level by walking, jumping and flying. Each level has enemies and things that get in the way, but sometimes these things also help Kirby. If Kirby touches an enemy, he loses a health point (he has six). Sometimes Kirby defeats mini-boss, before heading farther. Unlike the first "Kirby" game, it saves the game after each level. Players can go back to any level in the world that they have played by going through doors. There are seven worlds, and each world has between four and six levels, as well as a boss door and a Warp Star door. (Players can visit other worlds using Warp Stars). Except for World 7, each world also has one or more mini-games, a place to pick up powers, and an arena where Kirby fights a mini-boss.
Kirby can walk, jump, fly and inhale. Kirby can go as high as he wants as long as nothing blocks him, and he can fall back to the ground by exhaling. The puff of air can hurt enemies and break blocks.
Kirby can also inhale enemies and other things. He eats any food that he inhales, but enemies and other things remain in his mouth. He can either spit them back out and send them flying (hurting or destroying anything in their path), or he can swallow them. He also has a sliding move where he can kick enemies and blocks. When Kirby swallows an enemy, he "copies" that enemy's power. It is the first game in the series to do this, and Kirby has a lot of powers he can use. Once he has a special power, he can use it to fight enemies and solve puzzles. One example of a puzzle is where Kirby uses the Fire ability to light a cannon.
Music.
An official soundtrack was released on July 21, 1994. The vocalist was Mako Miyata.
Remakes.
In 2002, a remake titled Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land was released for the Game Boy Advance. The new version has, in addition to new visuals and sound, different minigames, a multiplayer mode, and other new features. However, it also had some criticism for the omission of certain materials that pushed the NES to the limit, and replaced by what is often considered lazy for the Game Boy Advance. For instance, the rotating pseudo-3D towers in Butter Building were removed. In addition, the difficulty is significantly lower. A demo of the game is available in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl". In 2011, a re-release of "Kirby's Adventure" named "3D Classics: Kirby's Adventure" was released for the Nintendo 3DS. It is a 3D version of the game.

A record chart (sometimes called a music chart) is a way of giving music a rank. The rank comes from the popularity of the music. The "Billboard" Hot 100 is a popular chart. The information on charts comes from some different sources, like the number of objects sold, the number of times a song was played on radio, the number of times a song or album was downloaded, and other criteria. Charts are sometimes made for a special genre, for example "Top 10 Rock Songs".

Edward "Ned" Kelly (3 June 1855 – 11 November 1880) was an Australian bushranger. He has become a symbolic figure in Australian history, folklore, books, art and movies. As a national icon, his image was used during the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. He is remembered in the saying "... as game as Ned Kelly"; the word "game" in this case meaning "brave".
While he was growing up, his family was often in trouble with the police. After fighting a policeman at his home in 1878, Kelly went to the bush to hide. He murdered three policemen who were searching for him. The government made Ned, his brother, and two friends outlaws. They became known as the Kelly Gang. Ned Kelly led the gang to rob a number of banks, and even capture a whole town. A final violent fight with police took place at Glenrowan. Kelly, dressed in home-made metal armour and helmet, was captured and sent to trial. Found guilty, he was hanged at the Melbourne Gaol in 1880.
A painting of Kelly by Australian artist Sidney Nolan was sold in 2010 for AU$5.4 million, the highest price ever paid for an Australian painting.
Early life.
Beveridge.
Edward 'Ned' Kelly was born in Canadia, north of Melbourne, in June 1855. The actual date is not known because the birth was not registered on the government list of births, deaths and marriages in Victoria. His prison records give the date as 1856. He was the son of Irish Catholic parents, John "Red" Kelly and Ellen Quinn. Red Kelly had been a convict who had been sent to Van Diemen's Land in 1842 for stealing two pigs. He moved to Victoria in 1848. He met Ellen Quinn, who had come to Victoria from Ireland with her family in 1841. Red started working for Ellen's father, James Quinn, who was a farmer at Beveridge. Ned was probably born at his grandfather's house. Around 1860, Red built a small house for his family, which is still standing in Kelly Street.
Avenel.
When Ned was about nine, his father moved the family north to a new farm at Avenel. Ned saved a young boy, Richard Shelton, from drowning in Hughes Creek. The Shelton family, who owned the Royal Mail Hotel, gave Ned a sash made from green silk for his bravery. The sash was long and wide. He was wearing this sash under his armour when he was captured at Glenrowan. The sash, still covered in Ned Kelly's blood, is now kept in the Benalla Museum. Red was not a successful farmer and was soon arrested for stealing cattle. In May 1866, he was given one month in prison and had to pay a fine of £25. Red died on 27 December 1866, and is buried in the Avenel Cemetery.
Greta.
Ellen Kelly moved the family to Greta. There were other members of Ellen's family living in the area. Her father, James Quinn, had moved from Beveridge to a large farm, called Glenmore, on the King River in north east Victoria. Her sisters, Catherine and Jane, and their ten children, were farming at Greta. Their husbands, brothers John and Thomas Lloyd, were in prison for stealing cattle. When Ellen came to Greta, her brothers, James, William and John Quinn, moved from Glenmore to help the sisters and their families. Some of the Quinn family had also been sent to prison for cattle stealing. James, Ellen's brother, had been charged ten times for cattle stealing. In 1868, Red Kelly's brother, James Kelly, came to visit Ellen. He got drunk and after an argument with the sisters, tried to burn their house down. He was given the death penalty, but this was later changed to 15 years in prison. The police thought the whole family were trouble makers and criminal.
Ellen Kelly and her children moved to a farm on the Eleven Mile Creek, between Greta and Glenrowan. Ned Kelly started work cutting down trees, breaking in horses, herding cattle and putting up fences.
Gaol.
On 14 October 1869, 14-year-old Ned was arrested for stealing money from a Chinese man. Kelly spent ten days in the police station lockup but there was not enough proof to send Ned to court and he had to be set free. Ned also worked in the bush with ex-convict Harry Power. 
Power had escaped from a Melbourne Gaol and started bushranging. Kelly was arrested in May 1870 for helping Power to rob people. He was kept in the gaol at Kyneton for seven weeks. Soon after this, Ned was in trouble again. With his uncle, Jack Lloyd, Ned had got into a fight with a hawker (a traveling salesman). They then sent a rude letter and some calf's testicles to the hawker's wife. In October 1870 he was sent to Beechworth gaol for assault and for being rude to a lady. He spent five months in Gaol.
Just three weeks after getting out of Gaol in April 1871, 16-year-old Ned was arrested again. He had ridden a friend's horse into Greta. He did not know that his friend, Isaiah "Wild Wright", had stolen the horse from the Mansfield post office. There was a fight when a policeman, Constable Hall, tried to arrest him. Hall tried to shoot Kelly three times, but his gun would not work so he hit him over the head with it instead. Kelly was sent to Pentridge Gaol in Melbourne. After four months he was moved to the prison ship, "Sacramento", at Williamstown. Prison ships were old ships that were used as extra prison space. Prisoners from the "Sacremento" worked during the day building a sea wall at Williamstown beach. They also worked on building a fort for the guns that were protecting Port Phillip Bay. Kelly was released from prison on 2 February 1874.
In August, Kelly met his friend "Wild Wright" in Beechworth. He must have been angry with Wright because of the stolen horse which had put him in prison. Behind the Imperial Hotel, they fought a bare knuckle boxing match that lasted for 20 rounds. Wright said later that "...he gave me the hiding of my life." In September 1877, Kelly was arrested in Benalla, for being drunk, riding on a footpath and resisting arrest. Kelly escaped from the police while they were taking him to the courthouse. After a fight with the police, he ran across the road into a boot shop and locked the door. Kelly gave himself up when the judge came over to the shop. One of the policemen involved in the fight to arrest Kelly was Thomas Lonigan. Lonigan was later shot dead by Kelly at Stringybark Creek.
The Fitzpatrick Incident.
Constable Fitzpatrick was in charge of the small police station in Greta. Because of the Kelly family's long history of criminal activity, Police Superintendent C. H. Nicholson had given orders that the police were not to go to the Kelly's house alone. But Fitzpatrick decided he would 'fix the Greta mob'. In April 1878, he went to the house to arrest Ned's brother, Dan Kelly for horse stealing. Dan had only been recently let out of prison. Fitzpatrick was probably drunk, as he had stopped at the Winton hotel to drink brandy. Dan Kelly refused to go back to the police station with Fitzpatrick, because the policeman did not have a warrant, the official document needed to make an arrest. Fitzpatrick then tried to make Kate, Ned's 15-year-old sister, sit on his knee so he could kiss her. This started a fight with members of the family and Fitzpatrick hurt his wrist. He and Ellen, Kate's mother, agreed to forget what had happened. But when Fitzpatrick went back to the Benalla police station he said Ned had shot at him three times and Ellen Kelly had hit him on the head with a shovel. Fitzpatrick lost his job with the police in 1881 after the head of the police force said he was a "liar".
A group of police led by Sergeant Steele went back to Greta, and arrested Ellen Kelly (with her baby Alice King), her son-in-law William Skillion, and a neighbour, William "Bricky" Williamson, for the attempted murder of Constable Fitzpatrick. Ned and Dan Kelly were not at the house and could not be arrested. Ellen Kelly said that Ned was not involved, and that he was working away. After a trial in Beechworth, Ellen Kelly was sentenced by Judge Redmond Barry to three years in prison for trying to kill Constable Fitzpatrick. Skillion and Williamson were given six years in prison. The police offered a reward of £100 for the capture of the Kelly brothers. In 1881 Williamson was let out of prison and given a full pardon because the government knew that he was innocent.
The Kelly Gang.
Stringybark Creek.
Ned and Dan Kelly went into hiding in the bush. They were later joined by two friends, Joe Byrne and Steve Hart. On 25 October 1878, two groups of police set out to find the Kellys. They knew the two brothers were hiding in the Wombat Ranges, a mountain range between Greta and Mansfield. One group started south from Greta led by Senior Constable Strahan. Strahan said he would shoot the Kellys down like dogs. A second group led by Sergeant Michael Kennedy set off from Mansfield heading north. Three other policemen were with him: Constables Thomas McIntyre, Thomas Lonigan, and Michael Scanlon. They set up a camp at Stringybark Creek in a thick forest area.
Kennedy and Scanlon went searching for the Kellys, while Lonigan and McIntyre remained at the camp. The Kellys were living in a hut nearby at Bullock Creek. They heard noises and discovered the police camp. They decided to capture the policemen and take their guns and horses. Ned and Dan went to the police camp and told them to surrender. Constable McIntyre put his arms up, but Lonigan got out his gun. Ned Kelly shot him dead. When the other two police returned to camp, McIntyre told them to surrender. When Scanlon went for his gun Kelly also shot him dead. Kennedy ran shooting from tree to tree with Kelly chasing him. Kelly shot him twice, in the armpit and in the chest. Kelly later said that Kennedy "...appeared to be suffering very much and in great agony...I did not wish to leave him alone to linger out in such pain.". Ned put his gun against Kennedy's chest and shot him again. Ned Kelly went back to the camp to get Kennedy's cloak which he then placed over the body. McIntyre escaped during the confusion and went back to Mansfield to tell everyone what had happened.
The Victorian government passed a law on 30 October 1878, to make the Kelly gang outlaws. This meant they no longer had any legal rights and could be shot by anyone. Anyone who could capture any member of the gang, alive or dead, would be paid a reward of £500, or £2,000 for all four men. At this time the police did not know that Hart and Byrne were members of the gang. The gang were seen at several places around north east Victoria. They tried to cross the Murray River to go into New South Wales, but the water was too deep. The police had several large groups hunting for them.
Euroa.
On 10 December 1878, the gang robbed the Australian National Bank at Euroa. They had stopped at Faithful Creek station (a farm) and held the people there prisoners. They locked 22 people including farm workers, hawkers (traveling salesmen) and visitors into a storeroom. Joe Byrne kept guard while the rest of the gang went into Euroa. They went to the bank and said they had a message from McCauley, the farm manager. They got into the bank and held up the bank's manager Robert Scott, along with two tellers (bank workers). After taking all the money, the gang forced Scott, his wife, family, maids and tellers to go with them back to Faithful Creek. They were locked up with the other hostages.
The outlaws gave a display of horse riding and tricks which entertained and surprised their hostages. After having supper, and telling the people not to leave the farm for another three hours, the gang left. The crime was carried out without injury and the gang stole £2,000.
Jerilderie.
The police increased the reward on the Kelly Gang. More police were sent to guard banks in the country. Friends of the Kellys were locked in gaol. The gang crossed the Murray River and rode north into New South Wales. They arrived in Jerilderie on Saturday 8 February 1879. They broke into the local police station and locked the two policemen, Richards and Devine, in the police cells. The outlaws put on police uniforms and mixed with the local people. They said that they were extra police from Sydney, who had come to guard the town from the Kelly gang. Ned Kelly took his horse to the blacksmith to get new horseshoes and told the man to send the bill to the New South Wales police force. On Monday the gang rounded up various people and forced them into the back room of the Royal Mail Hotel. While Dan Kelly and Steve Hart kept the hostages busy with "drinks on the house" (free drinks), Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne went to the telegraph office and cut down some of the poles and cut the wires. They then went and robbed the local bank of about £2,414. Kelly also burned all the townspeople's mortgage deeds in the bank. When the gang left the town they were singing about two earlier bushrangers, Ben Hall and Dan Morgan: "Hurrah for the good old times of Morgan and Ben Hall."
For the next 18 months the police were not able to find the Kelly gang. They punished anyone they thought might be helping the gang. More than 20 people were locked up in the Beechworth Prison for three months only because they were said to be friends of the gang. None of these people were ever charged with a crime. The government thought the Kelly gang might try and free their friends, so they put up large iron gates on the entrance to the prison.
The Jerilderie Letter.
Months before going to Jerilderie, and with help from Joe Byrne, Ned Kelly dictated a long letter (56 pages). The letter told his story, about how he became a bushranger, and the treatment of his family by the police. It also told the story of the treatment of Irish Catholics by the police and the English and Irish Protestant farmers. He even said there might be a revolution by people in north east Victoria to set up their own republic.
The "", as it is called, is a document of about 8,300 words and has become a famous piece of Australian literature. Kelly had written an earlier letter on 14 December 1878, to Donald Cameron, a member of the Parliament of Victoria, but it had been ignored. The Jerilderie Letter was never published. Kelly tried to find the editor of the local newspaper and get him to print the letter. He finally gave the letter to Edward Living, a teller at the bank. Living kept the letter, which was not re-discovered until 1930. It was then published by the "Melbourne Herald". The handwritten letter was given to the State Library of Victoria in 2000. Kelly's words are colorful, rough and full of metaphors. He said the police were "... big ugly fat-necked wombat headed big bellied magpie legged narrow hipped splay footed sons of Irish bailiffs or English landlords ...".
"Last stand".
Glenrowan.
The gang decided that Aaron Sherritt, Joe Byrne's best friend, was a police spy. On the night of 26 June 1880, Dan Kelly and Joe Byrne went to Sherritt's house in the Woolshed Valley near Beechworth and killed him. The four policemen who were protecting him at the time hid under the bed and did not report the murder until the next day. The outlaws knew that the police would send extra men to Beechworth by train to try and capture them. Ned Kelly and Hart arrived in Glenrowan on 27 June, and took 70 hostages at the Glenrowan Inn (hotel). They knew that a train loaded with police was on its way. They forced railway workers at Glenrowan to pull up the rail tracks to make the train crash. The bushrangers, wearing homemade armour, would then capture any of the policemen that were alive after the crash. With the police out of the way, the Kelly Gang would then go into Benalla and rob the bank. The captured police would be released when Ellen Kelly, William Williamson, and William Skillion, were let out of gaol.
But the plan to derail the police train failed. The police protecting Aaron Sherritt were too scared to leave his hut and the murder was not reported until the next day. The Kellys had to wait 24 hours longer for the police train than they had planned. The hostages were becoming difficult to control. To keep them amused the outlaws held a dance in the hotel, where Kelly danced a quadrille with Jane Jones, daughter of the hotel owner. They also had sporting events including the hop, step and jump. Kelly used two revolvers as extra weights while taking part in the jumping. A local school teacher, Thomas Curnow, talked Ned into letting him take his family home. As soon as he was free Curnow went down to the railway line, waving a lantern (light) wrapped in his red scarf. The train stopped safely.
The 46 police quickly left the train and placed themselves around the hotel so that the Kelly Gang was trapped inside. The gang members put on their armour, made from plough parts. All four had helmets. Each man's armour was quite heavy; Ned's armour weighed , which was about half his body weight. The police fired their guns into the building for seven hours. It is estimated that 15,000 bullets were fired during the shooting. The police ordered a cannon from Melbourne so that they could destroy the inn, but it would take too long to arrive so they set fire to the building instead.
At dawn on Monday 28 June, Ned Kelly came out of the inn wearing his armour. He marched towards the police, firing his gun at them. Their bullets bounced off his armour. Sergeant Steel shot him in his legs that were not protected by armour. Joe Byrne died in the front room from loss of blood because a gunshot cut his femoral artery. Dan Kelly and Steve Hart may have killed themselves as their bodies were found lying side by side in a back room with their heads on blankets. They had taken off their armour and it was found next to them. Several hostages were shot, and three died, including 13-year-old Jack Jones, the son of the hotel owner. Martin Cherry, a railway worker, was rescued from the burning hotel but died soon afterwards. George Metcalfe, a quarry worker, who was forced to pull up the railway line died later from injuries. The police had one small injury; the police Superintendent, Francis Hare, received a wound to his wrist, then fled the battle. The Royal Commission set up to examine the Kelly Gang later removed Hare from the Victoria Police.
Trial and execution.
Ned Kelly was taken to the Melbourne Gaol where he was treated for his wounds. He was visited by his mother who was in the same prison for wounding Constable Fitzpatrick. In August he was taken back to Beechworth by train for the first court hearings. The court agreed that Kelly would be tried in court for the murder of Thomas Lonigan and Michael Scanlon at Stringybark Creek. The government thought people around Beechworth might not find Kelly guilty of the crimes, and so they had the trial moved to Melbourne. At the trial the jury found Kelly guilty of both murders. He was sentenced to death by the Irish-born judge Sir Redmond Barry with the words "May God have mercy on your soul". Kelly said "I will go a little further than that, and say I will see you there when I go".
Many people did not agree with the death sentence. A petition with more than 60,000 names asked the government for mercy. Ned Kelly was hanged on 11 November 1880, at the Melbourne Gaol for murder. Several newspapers including "The Age" and "The Herald" reported Kelly's last words as "Such is life". Sir Redmond Barry died after a short illness on 23 November, 1880, only 12 days after Kelly's death.
Re-burial and recent DNA testing.
Following his death, a death mask of Ned Kelly was made. It required the shaving of his beard to make it. Afterwards, Ned Kelly was buried in an unmarked grave at the Melbourne Gaol, in an area with other criminals who had also been hanged at the gaol. The bones of 32 people were dug up in 1929 when the gaol was being redeveloped, and reburied at Pentridge Gaol in Coburg, Victoria. The burial site at Pentridge was rediscovered in 2008. DNA testing has proved that one set of bones was the skeleton of Ned Kelly. Experts from the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine said that the DNA clearly matches one of Kelly's living relatives. The bones show some of the injuries Kelly got during the shoot out with the police. The Kelly skeleton does not have a skull.
A skull, said to be Kelly's, was found during the digging at the gaol in 1929. It was put on display at the Old Melbourne Gaol, but it was stolen in 1978. On the anniversary of Ned Kelly's hanging, 11 November 2009, a farmer from Western Australia gave a skull back to Heritage Victoria which he said had been taken from the gaol. It was tested for DNA to see if it was Ned Kelly's skull. These tests showed it was not, and the location of Kelly's skull is still unknown.
In 2013, the Victorian Government finally gave Kelly's remains to his family. A funeral service was held at St. Patrick's Church, Wangaratta on 18 January, 2013. During the service, family members who read from the Bible wore a green silk sash. Relatives of Constable Michael Scanlon and Aaron Sherrit also attended the service. Kelly was buried in an unmarked grave at Greta on 20 January 2013.
The DNA that was recovered from Ned's skeleton was mitochondrial DNA. That was matched with one of Ned's maternal relations (Ned's grand nephew Leigh Olver). No adequate quality Y-DNA was recovered from Ned's bones or has been recovered from any of Ned's known paternal side relatives (Y-DNA is passed from father to son). There is a chance that a Y-DNA sample may be isolated from Ned's bones one day using more advanced laboratory procedures, however, it is also possible that a Y-DNA sample could be taken from the remains of one of Ned's male relatives such as his father, his uncles or his brothers. Their graves are all well known. A Y-DNA sample would reveal exactly which Kelly line Ned belongs to. Currently the Kelly Surname Y-DNA study has the results of over 500 Y-DNA samples but no comparison can be made until a sample from one of Ned's family is obtained. Based on location, the most frequent Kelly line in south-west Ireland (Tipperary, Clare and Kerry) is the O'Brien-Kelly line (L226+).
The Ned Kelly story.
Ned Kelly is still a major part of Australian popular culture. His story has been told in books, movies, plays and television shows. His image has been used for everything from cakes to tattoos. A recent study showed that people with a Ned Kelly tattoo were eight times more likely to be murdered. In 1980, the Australian Post Office released a set of postage stamps to remember the 100th anniversary of the siege at Glenrowan. In 2010 the National Gallery of Victoria paid AU$2.2 million for a painting of Ned Kelly by artist Sidney Nolan. It was Nolan's paintings of Ned Kelly that inspired the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. In June 2011 the Williamstown Australian Rules Football Club claimed that Ned Kelly had played 11 games for the club in 1873 while serving time in the prison ship. It was also claimed that in 1928 they had found a suit of armour buried on the football ground.

Azrael is the archangel of death. It is an English form of the Arabic name Azra'il or Azra'eil (), the name traditionally attributed to the angel of death in Islam and some Hebrew lore. The Qur'an never uses this name, referring instead to Malaikat al-Maut (which translates directly as angels of death; not one angel). It is also spelled Izrail, Izrael, Azrail, Ezraeil, Azraille, or Ozryel. Chambers English dictionary uses the spelling Azrael. The name means "Whom God Helps."
In Islam, Azrael is like death. But, because he is an angel, he does only whatever God tells him to do. Because many people die around the world, Azrael has helpers; other angels of death who are also mentioned in the Quran. 

An exhibition game (also known as simply exhibition, or a demonstration event, a friendly, a preparation match, a warm-up game) is a sporting event in which there is no competitive value of any real kind to any competitor (such as tournament or season rankings, or prize money) regardless of the outcome of the competition. The types of matches are usually played before a season so the coach can try a new formation or select players from the bench, like in Association football. 
Some sports have an all-star game. This means that the best players are picked from that league and they play against another all-star team or a better team from another country. These matches are usually friendlies, but have a little more competition. An example is the MLS All-Stars against Real Madrid CF.

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan (October 17, 1817– 27 March 1898) was a teacher and politician. He was a philosopher as well. He was also a social reformer. Furthermore, he founded the school that would later become Aligarh Muslim University. 
In 1857, there was a rebellion in India. This is known as the First Indian War of Independence. During this time, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan kept loyal to the British; He also saved many European lives. After the rebellion, he wrote a book where he said the British were, in fact, those who caused the rebellion. To settle whether Sir Syed was a communitarian or a communalist, we need to assess the speeches and articles which he wrote. One such speech of Sir Syed, which he gave in Meerut in the year 1888, clearly shows that Sir Syed turned to arguments fielded by religious fanatics to develop a communal alliance between Indian Muslims and British Christians. He said, 
He was unhappy about the position of Muslims in India, as their social and economic status was declining. According to Sir Syed, Muslims had to bring a positive approach to the British and accept their ways of education. He wanted the Muslims to benefit from the British. To achieve this task, he had to bring about cooperation between the Muslims and the British. To accomplish this, he did the following things:
Sir Syed played a vital role in the educational uplift of the Muslims in India. He did the following things to improve the educational standards:
Sir Syed also increased the political awareness of Muslims in the Sub-continent. At first, he believed in Hindu-Muslim unity, but later resolved to the two-nation theory. In 1885, the Indian National Congress was set up. It claimed to be the body of every Indian, regardless of religion. However, it later proved to be functioning only for the Hindus and tried to eradicate the Muslims. The Congress made three demands which were:
Sir Syed Ahmed Khan played a crucial 
role in improving the Muslim status. He worked tirelessly to restore relations between the Muslims and the British. He brought the Muslim revival through the Aligarh movement and showed the importance of education. Likewise, he brought an idea about the Two-nation theory and is hence known as “The Father of The Pakistan Movement” 

Mirza Ghalib born Mirza Beg Asadullah Khan , pen-name Ghalib "ġhālib" means "dominant") and Asad "Asad" means "lion") (27 December 1796 — 15 February 1869), was a great classical Urdu and Persian poet of India. Most notably, he wrote several ghazals during his life, which have since been interpreted and sung in many different ways by different people. He is considered to be the most popular and influential poet of the Urdu language.
Early life.
He was born in 1796 in Agra, India (then under the rule of the Mughal Empire). His father was Mirza Abdullah Beg Khan and his uncle was Mirza Nasrullah Beg Khan. His father Mirza Abdullah Beg Khan was an important Mughal noble who was prominent in the Mughal court. Mirza Ghalib become orphaned when he was just 5 years old. He lived with his uncle for 4 years, when his uncle too died. 
He started saying sher in Agra itself. He married the daughter of Nawab Ilahi Baksh 'Maaroof' and therefore moved to Delhi, India. In Delhi he devoted his full concentration to poetry. Soon he mastered the Persian language. So that no one should call him be-ustad ( without a teacher) he fabricated a story that he had an Iranian teacher Abdul Samad who lived in house for two years to teach him Farsi. Ghalib was always proud of his Farsi poetry but he is known more by his Urdu prose and poetry.
Later life.
He always lived his life lacking money. After 1857 the support from the Royal durbar stopped. The pension from the British Government was stopped because he was suspected of supporting the rebels. He even travelled to Calcutta to restart the pension but to no avail. He went to the Nawab of Rampur, who promised him Rupees 200 if he lived in Rampur and Rs. 100 if he lived anywhere else. His pension was resumed 3 years after that, but all that money was used up for paying old debts. Ghalib died in 1869. 
Letters.
Not only Urdu poetry but the prose is also indebted to Mirza Ghalib. His letters gave foundation to the easy and popular Urdu. Before Ghalib, letter writing in Urdu was highly ornamental. He made his letters "talking" by using words and sentences as if he is talking to the reader. According to him " from hundred of miles talk with the tongue of the pen and enjoy the joy of meeting even when you are separated". His letters were very informal, some times he will just write the name of the person and start the letter. He himself was very humorous and also made his letter very interesting. He said "I want to write the lines that whoever reads those should enjoy it". When the third wife of one of his friends died, he wrote. ."Allah Allah, there are some among us who have been freed from the prison three times and I have for the past 50 years this rope around my neck neither this rope breaks nor it takes my life" Some scholars says that Ghalib would have the same place in Urdu literature even only on the basis of his letters. 
Poetry.
In Urdu ghazals, along with the love and beauty Ghalib added all the facets of life. Because of him the canvas of Urdu ghazal became very extended. 
Since Ghalib was very occupied with Persian, his earlier shers used difficult words and his flights of imagination was such that..."either you (Ghalib) understand or the God (Khuda) understand". 
Ghalib was not a philosopher but he questioned things around him. "when there is no one besides you; then oh God why is this pandemonium?" 
One also find naughtiness in his writings, he makes fun of every thing and everybody including himself. "when the women are million years old what I will do with that paradise!" 
But Ghalib's sher not only have immediate effect on the heart but it makes you think too.

The nightingale ("Luscinia megarhynchos") is a small bird. It used to be put in the thrush family Turdidae. Now it is put on the Old World flycatchers, a group often called the chats or chat-thrushes. Its resemblance to thrushes is an example of convergent evolution.
It is a migratory insectivorous species. It breeds in forests and scrubs in Europe and south-west Asia. The distribution is more southerly than the very closely related thrush nightingale "Luscinia luscinia". It nests on the ground in or next to dense bushes. It passes the winter southern Africa. Studies have shown that nightingales seem to choose places to breed that meet certain criteria (Wink 1973):
The Nightingale is slightly larger than the robin, at around 15-16.5 cm length. It is plain brown above except for the reddish tail. It is buff to white below. Sexes are similar.
Nightingales are named so because they frequently sing at night as well as during the day. The name has been used for well over 1,000 years, being highly recognizable even in its Anglo-Saxon form - 'nihtingale'. It means 'night songstress'. Early writers assumed the female sang; in fact, it is the male. 
The song is loud, with an impressive range of whistles, trills and gurgles. Its song is particularly noticeable at night because few other birds are singing. This is why its name (in several languages) includes "night". Only unpaired males sing regularly at night, and nocturnal song is likely to serve attracting a mate. Singing at dawn, during the hour before sunrise, is assumed to be important in defending the bird's territory. Nightingales sing even more loudly in urban or near-urban environments, in order to overcome the background noise. The most characteristic feature of the song is a loud whistling crescendo, absent from the song of thrush nightingale. It has a frog-like alarm call.

Kirby's Dream Land 2 brought some of Kirby's copy abilities to the Game Boy, as well as a set of worlds like in Kirby's Adventure. Kirby's Dream Land 3, made for the SNES, also used these parts of the game, in a new story. let the player mix the copy abilities together to make new powers for Kirby to use.
More Kirby games were made for handheld game consoles: Kirby &amp; the Amazing Mirror for the Game Boy Advance, and for the Nintendo DS. They gave Kirby a large set of copy abilities, like in Kirby's Adventure.
Kirby's Return to Dream Land was made in 2011 for the Wii. It showed the modern look of the characters.

MINIX is a Unix-like computer operating system based on a microkernel architecture. Andrew S. Tanenbaum wrote the operating system so it could be used for educational purposes; MINIX also helped Linus Torvalds design the Linux kernel. Its name comes from the words "minimal" and "Unix".
Released under the BSD license, MINIX is free and open source.
History.
Andrew S. Tanenbaum created MINIX at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam.
MINIX 3.
MINIX 3 was announced to the public on 24 October 2005 by Andrew Tanenbaum during his speech on top of the ACM Symposium Operating System Principles conference. MINIX 3 currently supports only IA-32 architecture PC systems. It has a Live CD format that lets it be used on a computer without installing it.
Version 3.1.2 was released 8 May 2006. It contains X11, emacs, vi, cc, gcc, perl, python, ash, bash, zsh, ftp, ssh, telnet, pine, and over 400 other common UNIX programs. With the addition of X11, this version starts the change from a Text-Only System.
MINIX and Linux.
The design principles Tanenbaum applied to MINIX had influenced the design decisions Linus Torvalds applied in the creation of the Linux kernel. Torvalds used and appreciated MINIX, but his design was different from the MINIX architecture in significant ways, most notably by employing a monolithic kernel instead of a microkernel. This was famously disapproved by Tanenbaum in the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate. (Tanenbaum explained again his rationale for using a microkernel in May 2006.)
Linux being copied from MINIX.
In May 2004 Kenneth Brown of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution raised the accusation that major parts of the Linux kernel had been copied from MINIX, in a book called "Samizdat".
These accusations were rejected by Andrew Tanenbaum, who said that Kenneth Brown was very wrong and published a long rebuttal on his personal website.
Licensing.
Its licensing fee was very small ($69) compared to the ones of other operating systems. Although Tanenbaum wished for MINIX to be as easily available to students, his publisher would not allow it.
When free/open source Unix-like operating systems such as Linux became available in the early 1990s, many volunteer software developers stopped using MINIX for Linux. In April 2000, MINIX became free/open source software under a permissive free software licence, but by this time other operating systems were much better, and it was mostly used as an operating system for students and hobbyists.

Saint Thomas Church in Strasbourg is a Protestant church today. It is very important for Strasbourg, from a cultural and historic perspective. Strasbourg Cathedral had to be given to the Catholics when the French occupied Strasbourg in 1681. Since then, this church is the main Protestant church in the region. 
The veneration of St. Thomas at this particular spot was already present in the 6th century. A church and a school were built there in the 9th century. They burned down because lightning struck them in 1007 and again in 1144. A very large church built like a fortress to resist fires better was started in the year of 1196. Building works were interrupted several times, until they finished with building side-chapels in Gothic style. In 1524 the church became Lutheran. Today, it is in charge of several schools. There is also a seminary (A special school for priests) in the baroque building next to it. 
There are 5 naves in the church. It is the oldest such church in southwest Germany, and the only "hall church" in Alsace. The church is also known for its organs. One of them was built by Johann Andreas Silbermann in 1741. The family Silbermann (father and sons) were the most important German organ-builders of the 18th century. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart played on this organ several times during the three weeks he spent in Strasbourg in 1778 and wrote in a letter to his father Leopold Mozart about it. The other organ (built for the choir) was designed by Albert Schweitzer and built in 1906. 
There is a gothic fresco of Saint Michael in the church. This is the largest of its kind in France after that of St. Christopher in Wissembourg, which is ten meters high.
There are also many notable tombs and tombstones in the church, the oldest is a romanesque masterwork from the 11th century, and the largest a baroque monument to field-marchal Maurice of Saxony that fills up the entire rear wall of the choir. Maurice could not be buried in Paris because he was Protestant, and since he was German by birth, Strasbourg was a fitting place.
The Saint Thomas church also houses medieval stained glass in its windows, although Protestants destroyed parts of it in the early years of the Reformation.

In aviation, flight stewardesses or flight attendants — also known as cabin crew, stewards, air hosts/hostesses, or stewardesses, — are members of a cabin crew employed by airlines to assist the travelers. 
Stewardesses assist both the travelers but also the pilots who are busy driving the plain, as the pilots does not talk directly during driving to travelers they talk and send their messages to them by the stewardesses.
Stewardesses has also communications studies for this reason. 
Stewardesses are helping not only in piloting but sometimes in other types of transport as big buses.
Usually stewardesses are plane pilots assistants in air and are used to flight in air, to keep balance in air, and on plane, and are in good physical shape. 
Stewardesses has as pilots uniforms in civilian piloting for the professional level of their work. 
They make sure that the passengers on commercial flights (or, sometimes, business jets) are safe and comfortable during the flight.

The History of Pakistan, or Ancient Pakistan, includes the area of the Indus Valley. This area covers the northwest part of the Indian subcontinent and the eastern part of the Iranian plateau. It was important because it was both a fertile area where a big civilization grew and a place where South Asia connected to Central Asia and the Near East.
Timeline.
During the period 6000 BC and 2000 BC, late Neolithic culture and the start of the Bronze Age was taking shape in the Indus Valley.
The Neolithic era.
About 7000 years before, by 5100 BC, early Neolithic culture had developed in ancient Pakistan. People had learned farming. They tended goats, lived in houses build of mud, and had learned to make baskets. Potteries were also made. 
Persian and Greek invasion.
Around the 5th century BC, north-western parts of India faced invasion by the Achaemenid Empire and the Greeks of Alexander's army. Persian way of thinking, administration and lifestyle came to India. This influence became bigger during the Mauryan dynasty.
Achaemenid Empire.
From around 520 BC, Achaemenid Empire’s Darius I ruled large part of northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent. 
Then Alexander conquered these areas. Herodotus, a historian of that time has written that these areas were the richest areas of Alexander’s Empire. Achaemenid rule lasted about 186 years. In modern times, there are still traces of this Greek heritage to be found in parts of northwestern India.
Greco-Buddhist period.
Greco-Buddhism (also spelt as Græco-Buddhism) is a combination of culture of Greece and Buddhism. This mixture of cultures continued to develop for 800 long years, from 4th century BC until the 5th century AD. The area where it happened is modern day’s Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is an agency of the United States Department of Transportation with authority to regulate and oversee all aspects of civil aviation in the U.S. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 created the group under the name "Federal Aviation Agency", and adopted its current name in 1967 when it became a part of the United States Department of Transportation. The FAA is the single most influential government-run aviation agency in the world, with the European Aviation Safety Agency in a close second.
Major functions.
The FAA's roles include:

Lower Manhattan (or downtown Manhattan) is the southernmost part of the island of Manhattan, the main island and center of business and government of the City of New York. Lower Manhattan or "downtown" is defined most commonly as the area delineated on the north by 14th Street, on the west by the Hudson River, on the east by the East River, and on the south by New York Harbor (also known as Upper New York Bay). 
When referring specifically to the lower Manhattan business district such as Wall Street and its immediate environs, the northern border is commonly designated by thoroughfares approximately a mile-and-a-half (3 km) south of 14th Street and a mile (2 km) north of the island's southern tip: Chambers Street from near the Hudson east to the Brooklyn Bridge entrances and overpass. Two other major arteries are also sometimes identified as lower Manhattan's northern border: Canal Street, half a mile north of Chambers Street, and 23rd Street, half a mile north of 14th Street.

A flight recorder is a recorder placed in an aircraft to help with investigating an aircraft accident or incident. For this reason, they have to be capable of surviving extremely rough treatment. They are usually built to withstand an impact of 3600 "g" and temperatures of over 1,000 °C (as required by EUROCAE ED-112), because a powerful impact followed by a very hot fire is what often happens in a plane crash. 
There are two types of protected Flight Recorder, Flight data recorder (FDR) and Cockpit voice recorder (CVR). In some cases, the two recorders may be combined in a single FDR/CVR unit. The first combined flight recorder was invented by Australian scientist, David Warren.
These recorders are often called "black boxes". They can be used in other vehicles including trains and cars. The car's recorder can monitor the speed of the car or the sharpness of turns. The train's recorder can be used to upgrade after a crash to reduce the chance of another crash.

Toy Story 3 (also known as Toy Story 3: The Great Escape) is an American computer-animated movie. It was released by Pixar Animation Studios on June 18, 2010. It is a sequel to "Toy Story" and "Toy Story 2". In 2019, a sequel titled "Toy Story 4" was released.
Plot.
A 17-year old Andy is packing for college and his toys, who have not been played with in a long time, feel forgotten and abandoned. Andy decides to take Woody with him to college and intends to store the other toys in the attic. A misunderstanding with Andy's slightly aged mother results in the other toys being thrown away, making them think they are no longer wanted; they escape and decide to climb in a box to be donated to a daycare center called Sunnyside, along with Woody.
Andy's toys are welcomed by the numerous toys at Sunnyside, and given a tour of the seemingly perfect play-setting by Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear (aka "Lotso"), Lotso's chief enforcer Big Baby, and the smooth-talking Ken, the last of which Barbie falls in love with. All of the toys are quickly enamored with their new home, leaving Woody to try to return to Andy on his own. However, Woody is picked up outside the school by a little girl named Bonnie Anderson. She takes him home and plays with him along with her other toys, who are well treated, happy, and readily welcome Woody. Woody is elated until he hears about Lotso from Chuckles the Clown. Lotso, along with Big Baby and Chuckles, were once accidentally lost by their original owner, Daisy. The three found their way back to their owner's home. However, Lotso saw that he had been replaced. Even though Chuckles realized the truth, an embittered Lotso convinced Big Baby that they were abandoned. They used Big Baby's size to help him take control of the toys at Sunnyside in the fashion of organized crime. Worried for his friends, Woody hurries back to the daycare and finds that they have been put on task to be played with the rambunctious, toy-abusing youngest toddlers. They are also kept under guard at night by Buzz who Lotso has reverted to a demonstration state to destroy his memories, restoring his original "Space Ranger" persona and allying with him.
Woody rejoins his friends and they work out an escape plan involving the garbage dumpster. In the process, Buzz is accidentally reset into a Spanish-speaking mode during an attempt to restore him to normal. The toys reach the dumpster, but are headed off by Lotso and his evil henchmen. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody explains to Big Baby that Lotso has lied to him and that his owner still loved him, whereupon Big Baby, Ken and the other Sunnyside toys turn on Lotso and push him into the dumpster. However, Lotso manages to pull Woody in with him just as the garbage truck collects the dumpster. Woody's friends board the truck to rescue him, during which Buzz is hit by a falling television while saving Jessie, finally returning to his old self. The toys find themselves at the local landfill. They are soon pulled onto a conveyor belt leading to an incinerator. They help Lotso to reach an emergency stop button. Instead, he escapes and leaves them to be burned. Believing they are at their final moments, the toys join hands. They are rescued just in time by the squeeze toy aliens using a giant crane. The toys return to Andy's home, while Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver and is tied to its front grille as a decoration.
At Andy's house, Woody climbs back into the box with Andy's college supplies while the other toys resign themselves to the attic. Woody has a last minute inspiration. He leaves a note to Andy on the toys' box. Andy, mistaking it for a note from his mom, takes the box to Bonnie's home, introduces his old toys to Bonnie and gives her the toys to play with. In the end, Bonnie recognizes Woody, laying at the bottom of the box, to Andy's surprise. Andy is initially reluctant to give him to her. He eventually does so and then spends some time playing with her before he departs. Woody watches Andy's car while it disappears into the distance and quietly says a last "so long, partner." Woody and the other toys find themselves wanted and played with again. They learn through notes passed in Bonnie's backpack that Barbie, Ken, and Big Baby have turned around the life of all the toys at Sunnyside for the better.

Medical abbreviations are a shorthand way of writing and talking by medical professionals (people who work to help sick people) to hurry explanation of diseases (sickness), patients, or medicines (drugs).
This shorthand can include shortening (making less lengthy) of longer disease names, by cutting the word down to its base (the Latin or Greek part that makes it). Medical professionals also create (make) words that mean something. An example of this is "stat", used to indicate (show) that something needs to be hurried (done faster). It is from the Latin "base word" statim, meaning quick. A very commonly (often) used shorthand is shortening things on order forms for patients. An example is, "pre-op" meaning |pre-operation| (patient who is being prepared for surgery). These can be very complicated and extensive (meaning there is a lot of them).
Despite the fact that this shorthand might make it difficult for new Interns (new doctors) or recently trained nurses to get used to this unofficial language, it has been shown to improve (make better) the speed of treatment in hospitals.
Medical authorities in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have questioned the use of medical shorthand; believing that it can lead to mistakes being made due to less clear communication and have advised doctors to avoid its use.

This is a list of members of the Hockey Hall of Fame. The Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1943 and located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is a hall of fame and museum dedicated to the history of ice hockey. Originally, there were two categories for induction, players and builders, and in 1961, a third category for on-ice officials was introduced. In 1988, a "veteran player category" was established in order to "provide a vehicle for players who may have been overlooked and whose chances for election would be limited when placed on the same ballot with contemporary players." Eleven players were added into the category, but in 2000 the board of directors eliminated it and those inductees are now considered to be in the player category.
As of 2017, there are 271 players, 105 builders and 16 on-ice officials in the Hall of Fame. Eleven of the honourees have been added after their death.
Members.
Players.
The Player category has been in existence since the beginning of the Hall of Fame and the first players were added in 1945. Since then, 238 players have been added. For a person to be added to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a player, they must have been retired for a minimum of three years and must be nominated by an elected 18-person selection committee. The waiting period was waived for ten players deemed exceptionally notable: Dit Clapper (1947), Maurice Richard (1961), Ted Lindsay (1966), Red Kelly (1969), Terry Sawchuk (1971), Jean Beliveau (1972), Gordie Howe (1972), Bobby Orr (1979), Mario Lemieux (1997) and Wayne Gretzky (1999). Following Wayne Gretzky's retirement, it was announced that the waiting period would no longer be waived for any player except under "certain humanitarian circumstances".
As of 2007, a maximum of four players can be added in one year but the greatest number of players ever added in a year was 27, in 1962. They were added because the Hall of Fame was trying to induct many pre-NHL era players. 218 of the player inductees are Canadian-born, while only 10 European-born players have been added. The NHL team with the most player inductees is the Toronto Maple Leafs, with 55. Seventy-five defencemen are in the Hall of Fame, more than any other current position, while only 35 goaltenders have been added.
In 1988, a "veteran player category" was established in order to "provide a vehicle for players who may have been overlooked and whose chances for election would be limited when placed on the same ballot with contemporary players." Eleven players were added into the category, but in 2000, the board of directors removed it, and now those inductees are considered to be in the player category.
A. Player was inducted into the Veteran Player category. In 2000, it was merged with the Player category.
Source: 1945–2003: "Honoured Members: Hockey Hall of Fame" and newspapers.
Builders.
The Builder category has been in existence since the beginning of the Hall of Fame and the first builders were added in 1945. A Builder is a person who has contributed to the development of the game of hockey, and as the name refers, one who has built the game forward. Since then, 96 builders have been added. For a person to be added to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder, they may be "active or inactive" and must be nominated by an elected 18-person selection committee. As of 2007, a maximum of two builders can be added in one year.
Former members.
On March 30, 1993, it was announced that Gil Stein, who at the time was the president of the National Hockey League, had been added into the Hall of Fame. There were immediate allegations that he had engineered his election through manipulation of the hall's board of directors and by telling them to change the rules for selection. Two lawyers, hired by the league to lead an investigation, recommended that Stein's selection be overturned, although it was soon revealed that Stein had previously decided to turn down the induction.
In 1989, Alan Eagleson was added as a builder, but he would resign from the Hall in 1998 after pleading guilty of mail fraud and embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars. His resignation came shortly before a vote was held to expel him.
On-ice officials.
The On-ice official category has been in existence since 1961 and since then fourteen have been added. For an official to be added to the Hockey Hall of Fame, they must be retired for a minimum of three years and must be nominated by an elected 18-person selection committee. As of 2007, a maximum of one on-ice official can be added in one year.

Female ejaculation, also known as gushing or squirting, happens when a woman has an orgasm and clear fluid comes out of her. Scientists are not sure how the fluid is produced, but think it is produced by the Skene's glands (also called the paraurethral glands or female prostate). Female ejaculation was mentioned in ancient times by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 B.C.), and by doctors and people who study anatomy. However, in much of the 20th century there were people who did not believe that female ejaculation existed, and it was not studied in detail. More people found out about the matter after a book called "The G Spot" came out in 1982 and became popular. After that, more research was done on female ejaculation.
Not accepted by others.
The theory advanced by these authors has been dismissed by many other authors, such as physiologist Joseph Bohlen, for not being based on rigorous scientific procedures, and psychiatrist Helen Singer Kaplan (1983).
Masters and Johnson rejected it in 1982. Some radical feminist writers, such as Sheila Jeffreys (1985) were also dismissive, claiming it as a figment of male fantasy:

The suborder Suina (also known Suiformes) contains perhaps the earliest and most archaic even-toed ungulates.
Classification.
This suborden Suina includes family Suidae (pigs, hogs) and the family Tayassuidae (peccaries). Older morphogical studies also identified family Hippopotamidae (hippos) among the Suina.

White Oleander is a 2002 American drama movie set in California. It stars Alison Lohman, Michelle Pfeiffer, Robin Wright Penn and Renee Zellweger. It was directed by Peter Kosminsky and is based on the novel of the same name.
Plot.
Ingrid (Pfeiffer) is a photographer who falls in love with a man named Barry Kolker (Billy Connolly). However he is not loyal to her and has sex with other women. Ingrid kills him. She goes to jail and is later found guilty for killing him and goes to prison for a long time. Her daughter, Astrid Magnussen (Lohman), is taken to a series of foster homes.
Her first foster home is with a woman named Starr Thomas (Penn), who has two children, a teenager named Carolee and a young boy named David. During this home, she falls in love with Starr's husband. During a fight, Carolee runs away from home. An angry Starr shoots Astrid in the arm after an argument with her husband.
For a brief time, she is put in a place called "Mac," which houses hundreds of children. During this time, she gets into a fight with a bunch of other girls. She cuts her hair off and threatens the other girls, saying that she will slit their throats in their sleep if they attack her again.
Her second foster home is with a woman named Claire Richards (Zellweger). She is very lonely since her husband Mark (Noah Wyle) is often away on business trips. Astrid likes her a lot and how she always is nice and happy towards her. When Claire and Astrid visit Ingrid, however, Ingrid tells Claire that Mark is cheating on her. Astrid warns her mother not to destroy this home, but Ingrid smiles and says that she would rather have her at the worst foster home ever over Claire. Afterwards, Claire fights with Mark and later kills herself by swallowing a lot of pills at once.
Astrid is put in another home. She is very upset and thinks that her mom caused Claire to kill herself. She chooses a home with a Russian mother named Rena, knowing that Rena will not love her like Claire did because she does not want to see this happen again. This new mother has her sell her nice clothes. Astrid dyes her own hair and starts wearing black clothing. When Ingrid meets Astrid again, she is shocked at how Astrid has turned herself.
During this time, there is a movement to free Ingrid. They believe the original decision of "guilty" of killing Barry was wrong and want a new trial. If Astrid lies and agrees to Ingrid's version of the story, Ingrid will be likely be freed. But if she tells the truth, Ingrid will be put in jail again. Astrid uses this new power to force Ingrid to tell her about her father. Ingrid is then put on trial, but Ingrid tells her lawyer not to call Astrid to the stand. Ingrid is found guilty again and is put in jail.
The movie ends with Astrid, living with her new boyfriend Paul Trout (Patrick Fugit) in New York, putting together a series of suitcases that stand for all of her experiences through foster homes. She has redyed her hair blonde.

Chakswari (Urdu: ), also known as Chaksawari, is an area in the Mirpur District of Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. It comprises 15 Union councils including the Islamgarh Municipal Committee. Amongst the primary affectees from the raising of the Mangla Dam project were inhabitants of Chakswari and Islamgarh. Chakswari is 26 miles or 41.84 km from Mirpur. The political constituency code for Chakswari and Islamgarh is LA-2.
Chakswari had always been an important trunk road to and fro Mirpur city. Pre-Mangla Dam the Old Mirpur City now submerged under the Mangla Dam was a stone throw away from Chakswari. Naturally, all major hub towns tend to be bustling with traffic and subsequently economic and commercial activity. Chakswari was no different and remains a buzz with a activity and is a major economic and commercial hub outside Mirpur city even today. 
Chakswari comprises of many villages that border the Mangla Dam and surround the bustling Chakswari bazaar. A major city attributed to the state of Mirpur, it remains a major trunk road to travellers and traders to Dadyal, Kotli from and to Mirpur and Bhimber. Chakswari Bazaar is a major economy in the region and today you can find all modern amenities one would expect in any major city in Pakistan.
Main Source of income of Chakswari, Azad Kashmir is investment via respected overseas Kashmiri's who have moved to UK in the 60s and consecutive years to date. They have created well established communities in Bradford, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Dewsbury, Nottingham, Sheffield, Stoke-on-Trent and a small number in towns around Greater Manchester and found in the South of England in Luton, Oxford and Rachyal family in London.
People of Chakswari are very entrepreneurial in spirit but also hard working who initially worked in British manufacturing and textiles industries. By the time of the second generation they began to diversify into transport work and business. The third and fourth generation have successfully moved into business and professional careers. People of Chakswari like the vast majority of people of AJK are renowned for their hospitality, etiquette and hard work.
Geography.
Chakswari comprises partly plain and partly hilly areas. Chakswari has pleasant scenery and the climate is generally arid with little rainfall and is characterised by hot summers and cool winters. Its history begins long before the events of partition. The old part of the town is divided up into a number of sub areas, made up of local and rural residentials with farming belts. There is much family history tied in kinship to each locality that makes up Chakswari. Its old bazaar remains to this day a great commercial startup hub not only for locals but for people who have crossed into Azad Kashmir from other parts of Azad Kashmir, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Many people from oitside set up shop in Chakswari bazaar some for short term and many whom have now settled and adopted Chakswari as their home.
Chakswari is divided into two parts, the historic old town where the majority of the wholesale shops are based. This is very well established and known for its rich history. Chakswari's old Raja Bazaar is the old much loved indoor historic shopping centre in the old town. The old bazaar is actually very well maintained and a labyrinth of little streets with small outlets selling everything one can imagine. The bazaar is very safe, extremely clean and well maintained and is a hidden treasure and loved by the people of Chakswari and further parts, Dadyal, people of Kotli regularly frequent it. The old town still has some iconic restuarants like the iconic old Roopyal dining restaurant near the old bazaar recently refurbished to compete with some new establishments on the colony road but sadly the once Kalyal hotel is no more with time came its demise.
Then offcourse there is the more recent part referred to as Chakswari Colony. Chakswari Colony was built for the families who lost their homes following the construction of Mangla Dam. Like most small to large cities where the historic old towns were not built or equipped to manage a boom in population. Chakswari old town a d bazaar was also unable to meet the needs of a new generation who brought with them automotive traffic. Naturally Chakswari had to expand outwards, like in most places the shopping precints begin to grow out from the old town connecting itself and so the old town integrated into to the wider roads linking to Chakswari New Colony. The new shopping areas now boasts rivalry to most mid sized cities in Pakistan with some relatively good brands such as the Nafees Bakery, Chicken Cottage and many boutique and high end restaurants on the Kotli Road. Chakswari is also famous for its marriage halls including The Roopyal Marquee and Nashemam Marriage Hall. The Roopyal Marquee was the first super marriage hall in tne region if not Azad Kashmir. The Roopyal Marriage Hall which was the vision of the Late beloved Nadeem Roopyal just off the Kotli Road. In memory of Late Chaudhry Nadeem Roopyal it is today rightly so renamed Nadeem Roopyal Suites &amp; Marquee who was a trailblazer for modern Marquees now found across the Kotli Chakswari road to Mirpur.
Chakswari is well known for it's important shrine. It is most commonly known as Noshahi Pir who were said to be from the lineage of The Prophet Muhammad PBUH. The Noshahi Haji, Pir Ganj Baksh tomb is in Ralmal Sharif in Gujrat.Ralmal Sharif, Pahlia, Gujrat; as well as Doga Sharif in rural Gujrat. As well as Noshahi Family in Saher Mandi in AJK. There is history of Noshahi Darbar Pir coming to Chakswari to and spreading awareness of Islam and teachings of The Prophet Muhammad. There is also a Chowk named after Noshahi Darbar just outside the bazaar.They were known for helping the people of Chakswari with things like poverty and education. It is one of the most famous Sufi shrines in the region. Chakswari also has lots of mosques, the main one being the Jamia Masjid located in the town. There are other mosques too such as the Jamia-e-Haydar Masjid or Ghazi Hasan Masjid which owes its name to the 15th century Muslim warrior in the region, Raja Ghazi Hasan Khan. 
The ancient history of Chakswari can be traced back to the Old Grave Yard located in old Chakswari, leading to the land all around the old town of Chakswari. The old Ancestral Graveyard is located near Gazal Shaav (Holy Site).
Notable parts of Chakswari include Kalyal, Buna Mora or Taki Kalyal, Ladhar, Susral, Panyam, Rachyal, Roopyal, Tagdew but there are many more with rich heritage and history also.
Very notable Azad Kashmiris have hailed from Kalyal village and therefore Kalyal has always been held in high esteem.

Brief History.
During the 1947 Poonch rebellion the demographics of Jammu State changed from a Muslim majority state to a Hindu marginal majority state. The genocide was politically motivated to ensure Kashmir would ascede to India and the independence movement squashed. Subsequently, a huge revolt took place by the indigenous Muslim Kashmiri population of Jammu and Kashmir against Maharaja Hari Singh and the Indian State. 
What began as a economic peaceful boycott by the Indigenous muslim population, beginning as a No Tax revolt soon became a freedom struggle as news of the massacre of Muslims in poonch by Hari Singh and the Indian State reached across the state. This subsequently led to the First Kashmir War where Chakswari served as a strategic location for the Muslim rebels who styled themselves as the "Azad Army". Chakswari was an important staging ground for the revolt and supply of amunition to the Muslim freedom fighters that led to liberation from The despotic Dogra's with support from the state of Pakistan. This struggle led to the liberation of parts of Kashmir which is dearly referred to by Kashmiris as Azad Kashmir or Free Kashmir from the tyranny of Hari Singh and the Indian State.
In the 1960s once again the region of Chakswari and its neighbouring areas would prove strategic for Pakistan. This time, it was to build the Mangla Dam at the foot of Mangla and collapse the surrounding areas of Mirpur to support the water needs of the state of Pakistan. 
Mangla Dam History.
In 1960 IWT (Indus Waters Treaty) was signed; according to this treaty, India was awarded rights to the Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi rivers, and Pakistan besides the waters of these three rivers within Pakistani territories, and some financial compensation was granted rights to construct the Indus, Chenab, and Jhelum river basins.
Until 1967, Pakistan’s whole irrigation system was totally dependent on the unchecked flow of the River Indus and its main tributaries.
Issue of Poor Agricultural Production.
The agricultural production was very poor for a variety of reasons, the most important being the shortage of water during the crucial growing seasons. This issue arose from seasonal fluctuations inflow of the river due to monsoons and the lack of storage facilities to store large quantities of excess water during times of heavy river discharge.
The Mangla Dam was among 2-dams built to overcome this shortcoming and reinforce the irrigation country’s infrastructure as a part of the Indus Basin Program, while the 2nd was the Tarbela Dam located on the River Indus in Swabi, KPK.
Mangla Dam Construction.
Cost
The dam was built at the cost of Rupees 15.587 billion, ADB (Asian Development Bank) and World Bank-funded for the dam.
Reservoir
The dam was built between 1961 &amp; 1965 across the river Jhelum in the Mirpur district of AJK (Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir), some 108 km southeast of Islamabad. The components of the Mangla Dam include intake structures, power station, five tunnels, emergency spillway, main spillway, intake embankment, main embankment, and a reservoir.
Apart from the main dam, Sukian dyke seventeen-thousand feet long and a small dam named the Jari Dam to obstruct the Jari Nala-had to be built eleven miles outside the new town of Mirpur. There were 120 x 106 yd3 (cubic yards) of the trench for the reservoir, while the total fill was 142 x 106 yd3 &amp; concrete to 1.96 x 106 yd3, respectively
With the advent of the Mangla Dam project, like most villages of Mirpur district; people of Chakswari migrated to the UK and other countries from the 1960s onwards. 
The Mangla Dam remains a very important structure and holds strategic and climatic importance just as it did back the. It was a vital project for the people of Pakistan and agriculture of Pakistan. Often overlooked are the real silent heroes who to this day are rarely acknowledged by the vast majority of Pakistanis for their sacrifice. Families of Azad Kashmiris were displaced and uprooted and families divided as a result. Azad Kashmiris from more so the people of Mirpur faced three major catastrophic upheavals in their modern history. The first was the advent of the Dogra occupation who were gifted the state of Kashmir illegally by The British for a pittance. The Dogra barbarity displaced thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Kashmiris from Jammu and Kashmir into into what we lovingly call Pakistan today. The vast majority displaced into West Punjab as it was commonly known back then. The second was during partition, when Kashmiris faced the major brunt of the Indian states wickedness through sectarianism through their stooge Maharaja Hari Singh. This resulted in alot of innocent Kashmiris bloodshed and hundreds and thousands were killed. Thirdly, what has been often overlooked and equally disruptive was the construction of The Mangla Dam. Not to say Azad Kashmiris did not acknowledge The Mangla Dam for the greater good but their sacrifice often overlooked or simply never known by their brethren in Pakistan.
Buildings.
Chakswari is well known for the existence of The Holy Pir. It is most commonly known as Noshahi Pir who were part of the Muhammad family tree.

It is one of the most famous Sufi shrines in the region. Chakswari also has lots of mosques, the main one being the "Jamia Masjid" located in the town. There are other mosques too such as the "Jamia-e-Haydar Masjid" or "Ghazi Hasan Masjid" which owes its name to the 15th century Muslim warrior in the region, Raja Ghazi Hasan Khan.

Brief origins summary of the Kalyal clan.
The predominant inhabitants of Chakswari are Jat and Chaudhry biradri (family) and there has been an emphasis and interest on the major Jat clan of Chakswari namely the Kalyal Jat clan.
Origins of the Kalyal Jat clan lineage
The Kalyal Jat clan is a prominent clan found along the Jhelum River, Mirpur Region (Chakswari) but further up in other regions like Dadyal Azad Kashmir and Gujjar Khan in the Punjab. Sadly British colonialism and independence struggle history took precedence over local regional history in the modern era and little academic work was inked about the great Jat clans of the Jammu and Kashmir region that crossed the Jhelum river to Western Punjab regions like Jhelum, Gujjar Khan and further into the Gujrat regions. The Kalyals (Kalial's) were a prominent clan and thus some piecemeal history exists and referenced here. Even the early 20th Century British ethnologist, H. A Rose has made a reference to the Kalyal Jat clan as being the last of the Rajput Jat clans.
"Sombanai descent and Rajput ancestry i.e., a last status as Rajput— are claimed by the Kalial (Kalyal)."
Horace Arthur Rose was an early 20th Century British colonial official who co-authored "A Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province", which is one of the most comprehensive Glossary on the tribes of Punjab, and a good source on many Punjabi tribes.
the Kalyal (Kalial) tribe claims descent from Kala Khan or Mal Khan, a Chandravanshi Rajput, who settled in the Potohar region in the 15th Century. However, some Kalyal (Kalial) lineages claim Suryavanshi ancestry.
There are also a widespread tradition that Kal to be a Bhatti Rajput, which would make the Kalyal a clan of the Bhatti tribe. Therefore, the Kal aal are the descendants of Kals. The Kalyal are essentially a tribe of the Chibhal, a region between the Tawi and Jhelum rivers, now divided by the line of control, forming the districts of Mirpur and Bhimber in Azad Kashmir, Rajouri, Reasi and parts of Jammu district west of the river Tawi in Indian administered Kashmir. From Chibhal, groups of Kalyal began migrating to the Punjab plains, initially settling in around Dina, and Sahowa and then spreading to Gujar Khan, which is home to the greatest concentrations of Kalyal. Most of the Gujarkhan Kalyal claim to a be a clan of the Bhatti Rajputs. Other groups moved southeast, settling in Gujrat district, where they are still an important Jat clan. There is a single Kalyal village in Kharian Tehsil of Gujrat district.
Kalyal in Azad Kashmir (Chakswari, Mirpur region).
The most visible branch of the Kalyal are found in a single village named Kalyal in Chakswari, Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Giving credence to the Rajput lineage due to the influential personalities that came from this village. To this day, the Kalyal village descendants remain a very influential prominent group in Chakswari and Mirpur city. The Kalyal, Chakswari family remain influential across Mirpur state and city which is the economic hub of Azad Kashmir. The Kalyal village in Chakswari was widely known as the home of Chakswari nobility or gentry in the past. Further divisible Kalyal branches are also found in Mohra-na-Mohra / Mohra Mundian and Pind Kalan villages Add-ne-Plai, Laddar and Domal (now inundated by the Mangla Dam) and also Gaderi (now inundated by the Mangla Dam), while another branch is in Palaak, Tarnot, and Arnoh, near Panyam.
Further Jatt branches migrated from Sialkot to Gujrat Gorsian, from there to the Mirpur region and settled in the villages of Panyam (Moohri Panyam / Baavaya-ni-Moohri – these have largely moved to New Abadi Kalyal Chakswari due to the Dam); Essar, Pind Kalan; Gowanda and Prahi (near Chok Sahiban); and Mera Kandi.
In Panyam Chakswari, also known as Sarr-wala-Mohra, branche/s of the Kalyal's originate in Tope Mankiala near Rawalpindi. Finally, there is also a lineage found in the village of Kalyal Sheru.

Jalalabad () is a city and a municipal council of Ferozpur District in the Punjab state of the Republic of India.

Zira () was one of the two tehsils of Punjab that was part of a controversy during the Partition of India. The other tehsil was Ferozpur. Sir Cyril Radcliffe created the boundary between India and Pakistan just days before the partition. A draft of the award was supposedly sent to Evan Jenkins by George Abell, Lord Mountbatten’s private secretary. Jenkings was the provincial governor of Punjab at the time. The draft had the description of the Punjab boundary. It showed that the tehdils of Ferozepur and Zira tehsils were to be a part of Pakistan.
The final version of the boundary gave the areas to India. This caused Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, to say that the award was not just, incomprehensible and perverse. He did agreed to accept the action. The dispute was settled in 1960 as part of an agreement between the governments of India and Pakistan.

However, according to Ric Flair in his autobiography, Dusty Rhodes invented The Great American Bash.
After the last Great American Bash by World Championship Wrestling in 2000, The Great American Bash did not happen again until 2004 and only Smackdown! superstars were on it until the 2007 event when Raw and ECW superstars joined. Something special about this pay-per-view is that anyone in the American military can see The Great American Bash for free.

Hy-Vee is an employee owned chain of supermarkets in the Midwestern United States. As of January 2008, Hy-Vee runs 197 supermarkets and 26 Drugstores in seven states. Over 100 of its supermarkets are in Iowa, but it also has stores in Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota. Hy-Vee is known for its longtime advertising slogan, "Where there's a helpful smile in every aisle."
Two-time National Football League MVP Kurt Warner once worked at a Hy-Vee Store in Cedar Falls, Iowa. After he was cut by the Green Bay Packers at age 24, he thought his football career might be over, so he worked there to play for his bills.
Company starting.
The company was started by Charles Hyde and David Vredenburg. They had opened a general store in Beaconsfield, Iowa, in 1930. In 1938, the company changed their name to Hyde &amp; Vredenburg, Inc. Hyde &amp; Vredenburg had 15 stores in Iowa and Missouri at that time. In 1945, Hyde &amp; Vredenburg moved its headquarters from Lamoni to Chariton, Iowa, after buying the Chariton Wholesale Company. 
Stores.
Most Hy-Vee stores are full-service supermarkets with bakeries, delicatessens, banks, florists, and pharmacies. To keep pace with Wal-Mart's recent expansion into the gas station business, Hy-Vee has also added gas stations with convenience stores to some of its stores.
HyVee's Largest Store is in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, which has 
over of Retail Space in the store. Hy-vee keeps making larger stores, so their largest store changes every 6 months to every year.
Employment.
Hy-Vee Inc. employs over 52,000 people and is the largest employer in the state of Iowa. The company has annual sales of over $5.84 billion. In 2007, Hy-Vee ranked 47th on "Forbes" magazine's annual list of the largest privately owned companies in the United States.

Higher education is after secondary education. Through attending college a higher degree (or title) can be gained. Generally, people must be 18 years old or over to enter higher education. They also need to have completed primary school and secondary education. Usually some kind of selection is used. Exams can be of state, local or university level. Sometimes no selection exists. Some open universities encourage older adults to apply, whether they were good at school or not.
Preparation.
Higher education is either professional or academic. You can study for a diploma or a degree. Graduates can study for a master's or doctorate. Places of higher education were traditionally called universities, but there are other names like institute, teaching training college, academy, conservatory, and polytechnic. (The names depend on the country).
Other functions.
Research work is done at this level. Colleges often also reach out to employers and offer cultural or sporting events open to the local community.
Role in society.
The importance of higher education in society changes according to the country; for example, in many countries a student goes to university to obtain a diploma for work, but university is also often a time during which the student learns to be independent. Students also learn to mix with people of different origins, and to grow as people. Richer students can study in a place far from their hometown, but kids from poor neighbourhoods may be unable to afford college at all without a scholarship of some kind.

Panic attacks are sudden periods of very bad anxiety. Along with feeling very scared, people with panic attacks usually have physical symptoms. These symptoms are not dangerous. However, they can make a person feel terrible for a short time. Having a panic attack is often terrifying and very upsetting. Many people who have a panic attack for the first time call the emergency services because they think they are having a heart attack or a nervous breakdown.
Though panic attacks make people feel terrible, they are not dangerous. Usually, the worst symptoms are over in ten minutes or less. However, some panic attacks can be as short as one to five minutes.
Panic attacks can happen in people with all kinds of mental illnesses. They can also happen in people who do not have mental illness, but have just had something very bad happen to them. 
A panic attack is sometimes confused with anxiety. Anxiety is progressive. When we think of negative thoughts, the anxiety becomes worse when we do not try to relax and it reaches to a point when we're out of control. A panic attack is not progressive, when we think of negative thoughts, a panic attack goes straight to us feeling out of control and people think they're having a heart attack because an anxious heart feels very similar to a heart attack. A panic attack is far worse than an anxiety attack, though both attacks require the person to learn how to calm down or get professional help if it becomes a problem in their daily lives. 
Symptoms.
The new Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), DSM-5, describes a panic attack as:
"An abrupt [sudden] surge of intense [very strong] fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes... [During that] time four or more of the following symptoms occur. The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state."
According to DSM-5, a person is having a panic attack if they suddenly start feeling very scared and have four or more of these symptoms:
The physiology behind panic attacks.
Panic attacks happen when the body's natural fight or flight response gets overprotective. Usually, the fight or flight response kicks in when a person is in danger. It tells the sympathetic nervous system to make many changes in the body. These changes will help the person fight or run away from the danger. For example:
When a person is truly in danger, these changes in the body can help the person survive. The changes in the body make it easier for the person to fight or run away from the danger.
However, when a person is having a panic attack, their body is reacting as if they are in danger, when they are really not. Their fight or flight system kicks in and causes changes to the body. But because the person does not need these changes to help them survive, the changes cause symptoms. For example:
Every symptom of a panic attack is caused by the fight or flight reaction. This is why panic attacks are not dangerous. The fight or flight system is meant to save a person's life if they are in danger. It is a natural self-defense system in the human body. When a panic attack happens, this life-saving fight or flight system is simply kicking in when it is not needed.

The tiger shark ("Galeocerdo cuvier") is a species of requiem shark, and is the only member of the genus Galeocerdo. This is one of the largest known species of shark. It reaches lengths of up to 5.5 metres (18 feet), and weighs over 900 kg (2000 pounds). The tiger shark is found throughout the world's coastal temperate and tropical waters, with the exception of the Mediterranean Sea, and have been known to swim to depths of up to 350 metres (1150 feet). Tiger sharks feed mainly on bony fish, rays, squid, crustaceans, seals, and dolphins. The tiger shark is the only species in its family which is ovoviviparous, giving birth to 10-82 pups at a time.
Description.
The tiger shark gets its name from the black spots and stripes which run the length of the body, like a tiger. The front of the body is quite sturdy, but becomes more slim at the back. It has a large, strong head with big eyes and a very blunt snout. The first dorsal fin is quite wide, and is located at the back of the pectoral fins. The much smaller second dorsal fin is located at the front of the anal fin which is strongly recurved. There is a ridge along the back between the dorsal fins.
The jaws of the tiger shark have large, sharp teeth which helps the shark to cut through the flesh and bones of their prey. Each tooth is jagged around the edges. The upper and lower teeth are similar in shape, and the teeth at the front are larger than the back teeth.
The dorsal surface of the tiger shark is bluish-green to dark grey or black, and the belly is yellowish-white to pure white in colour. The black spots and stripes of the tiger shark are more visible on young ones, and they fade as the shark matures.
The tiger shark is one of the largest known sharks, commonly reaching a length of 3.25-4.25 metres (11-14 feet), and weighing around 385-635 kg (850-1400 pounds). New born tiger sharks range in lengths between 51 to 76 cm (2 to 2.5 feet). Males reach maturity at 2.3-3 metres (8-10 feet), while females become mature at 2.5-3.3 metres (8-11 feet). The largest specimens are believed to reach lengths of up to 5.5 metres (18 feet), and weigh over 900 kg (2000 pounds).
Habitat.
The tiger shark is found throughout the world's coastal temperate and tropical waters, with the exception of the Mediterranean Sea. In the western Atlantic, it is found from Massachusetts to Uruguay, and in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bahamas, and the Caribbean Sea. In the eastern Atlantic, it is found in Iceland and possibly the U.K (due to the warm Gulf Stream), Morocco, Canary Islands, and from Senegal to Ivory Coast. In the Indian Ocean, it is found in Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Thailand, Vietnam, and from the Red Sea to South Africa. In the western Pacific, it is found in southern China, Japan, Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Palau, Solomon Islands, Marshall Islands, and Tahiti. In the eastern Pacific, it is found in Hawaii, Galapagos, and from southern California to Peru.
The tiger shark is found in many different kinds of marine habitats, but it usually prefers murky waters in coastal areas. It is also commonly found in estuaries and harbours. Shallow areas around large island chains and oceanic islands, including lagoons, are also part of the tiger shark's natural environment. The tiger shark is found near the surface to depths of up to 350 metres (1150 feet).
Behaviour.
The tiger shark is nocturnal. During the day they are mostly inactive, and they hunt during the night. They are solitary, and may attack any shark or human that comes near them. The Tiger shark can be very aggressive, and along with the great white and the bull shark, it is one of the most dangerous sharks for humans.
Feeding.
Tiger sharks have a wide variety of prey. They feed on rays, bony fish, dolphins, carrion, sea birds, sea turtles, sea snakes, crustaceans, seals, squid, and small sharks of other species. Some Tiger sharks have been found with ship garbage, and car license plates in their stomachs. Adult tiger sharks have also been known to prey on young tiger sharks.
One large female caught off the north end of the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea had two empty cans, a plastic bottle, two burlap sacks, a squid, and a 20 cm long fish in its stomach. Also, many tiger sharks caught in harbours have been found with garbage in their stomachs.
Tiger sharks are able to find food in the dark by picking up the vibrations made by their prey in the water, and also because of their enhanced vision.
Reproduction.
For the tiger shark, maturity depends on size and not on age. Males reach maturity at 2.3-3 metres (8-10 feet), while females become mature at 2.5-3.3 metres (8-11 feet).t Tiger sharks are ovoviviparous, and females only mate once every 3 years. The time of which the mating season occurs depends on the location. In the Northern Hemisphere the mating season lasts from March until May, and in the southern hemisphere the mating season lasts from November until January. The gestation period lasts up to 16 months, and females can give birth to 10-82 pups at a time. The average lifespan in the wild for a tiger shark is 12 years.
Human interactions.
The tiger shark is second on the list of number of recorded attacks on humans, with the great white shark being first. Fortunately though, attacks are rare. In Hawaii, although tiger sharks were responsible for several deaths in the 1990s, there is an average of one shark attack per year.
Due to being fished commercially and recreationally, in some parts of its range, the tiger shark's population has decreased. Like many shark species, the fins of the tiger shark are highly prized in Asia for making shark-fin soup. Also, its meat is eaten by people, its skin is used to make leather, and its liver is taken as a source of Vitamin A. Fortunately, this species is quite fast growing and produces large numbers of young, so the tiger shark faces no real threat. Also, in areas where the numbers of adults have been reduced due to fishing, young tiger sharks have been found to be more common, as predation from the adults is lessened. Nevertheless, as the demand for shark fins continues to grow, there is concern that it could have a serious impact on this species in the future. The tiger shark is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN.

Robert Anthony Rodriguez (born June 20 1968) is an American director, screenwriter, producer, cinematographer, editor and musician perhaps best known for making profitable, crowd-pleasing independent and studio movies with fairly low budgets and fast schedules by Hollywood standards.

Telegraphy (from the Greek words "tele (����)" = far and "graphein (�������)" = write) is the long-distance transmission of written messages without physical transport of letters.
A telegraph sends electric pulses in a special code, composed from short and large marks. Usually, amateur radio operators use Morse code. 
History.
Some of the first telegraphs were made in the late 1700s, but these were hard to use because they had too many wires. Samuel Morse made a telegraph using only one wire. In 1844, he built a telegraph line from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., and soon, there were telegraphs all over the United States. This made it easier for people to talk to people far away and made it easier for people to move out West. A transatlantic telegraph cable and other developments linked the world by the end of the century. Radio telegraphy became widespread in the early 20th century, especially on ships.
People would send messages called "telegrams" to other people. They would give the message to a telegraph operator, who would send the message using Morse code. The operator on the other end would write down the message and give it to the person receiving the message. After the 1930s, it became cheaper to make long-distance telephone calls than to send telegrams, so fewer telegrams were sent. Western Union, an American company that was created for telegrams, sent its last one in 2006.
Telegraphs now.
Telegraphs have become rare. This is because of newer technology that people can use to communicate, such as the telephone and the Internet. However, morse code is still popular among amateur radio enthusiasts.

Gout is a very painful medical condition. It is a red, tender, hot, swollen joint. The attacks happen most often in the joint at the base of the big toe. It is caused by crystals getting deposited from the blood. This happens when the level of uric acid in the blood is too high. The crystals then stay in joints, tendons, and surrounding tissues.
Inflammatory arthritis happens in about 50% of all cases of gout. The disease may also appear as kidney disease due to urate crystals. People with gout often have more than one attack of gout.
Doctors decide a patient has gout if they find crystals in the joint fluid. Treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, or colchicine improves symptoms. Once an attack goes away, the patient can change his or her lifestyle to reduce levels of uric acid. People who have gout attacks often may take allopurinol or probenecid to prevent symptoms later.
Gout has become more common. It affects approximately one to two percent of people in the West during their lifetimes. Risk factors have been increasing and may be causing the increase in gout. Metabolic syndrome, longer life expectancy, and changes in diet are the most common risk factors. Gout was historically known as “the disease of kings” or “the disease of rich men".
Signs and symptoms.
Gout can present in a number of ways, although the most common is a recurrent attack of intense inflammatory arthritis (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint). Joint pain usually begins over 2–4 hours and during the night. Symptoms occur at night because of the lower body temperature at this time.
High levels of uric acid in the blood over a long period of time (hyperuricemia) may cause other symptoms such as hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi. Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. High levels of uric acid in the blood may also cause crystals to form in the kidneys. This causes stone formation followed by urate nephropathy.
Cause.
A very high, abnormal level of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia) is the basic cause of gout. Diet and a person's genes are two of several possible causes of the high levels. Levels can also become high if the body cannot excrete enough urate, the salts of uric acid.
Lifestyle.
The kinds and amounts of foods people eat cause about 12% of gout. Drinking alcohol or fructose-sweetened drinks, and eating meat and seafood can cause this disease. Injuries and surgery may also start an attack of gout. Recent studies showed that some beliefs about connections between diet and gout were not true. Eating purine-rich vegetables (e.g., beans, peas, lentils, and spinach) or large amounts of protein do not contribute to developing gout. Coffee, vitamin C, and dairy products, as well as physical fitness appear to decrease the risk. These things reduce insulin resistance and may reduce cases of gout.
Inherited causes.
Inherited factors are about 60% responsible for the variability in uric acid level. Two genes called SLC2A9 and ABCG2 are commonly associated with gout. Variations in these genes can almost double the risk of developing this disease.
Medical conditions.
Gout often happens with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome happens along with nearly 75% of all cases of gout. Gout often makes these other problems worse or harder to treat: polycythemia, lead poisoning, renal failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, and solid organ transplants. Males have three times the chance of getting gout when the body mass index is greater than or equal to 35. Frequent lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout because lead harms the kidney function.
Changes in the body.
Gout is a disorder of purine metabolism, and occurs when its final metabolite, uric acid, crystallizes in the form of monosodium urate. The blood deposits the crystals in joints, on tendons, and in the surrounding tissues. These crystals then trigger a local immune system inflammatory reaction. Uricase is required to breakdown uric acid. An evolutionary loss of uricase in humans and higher primates has made this condition more common.
The triggers that cause uric acid to build up in the blood are not well understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, it is more likely to do so as uric acid levels increase. Other factors believed to be important in triggering an acute episode of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration, and extracellular matrixproteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens, and chondroitin sulfate. The increased crystallization at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to a number of factors, including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics, and stopping or starting the medication allopurinol.
Diagnosis.
Gout may be diagnosed and treated without further investigations in someone with hyperuricemia and the classic podagra. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, synovial fluid analysis should be done. X-rays are useful for identifying chronic gout only. X-rays are not useful for treating acute gout attacks.
Synovial fluid.
A definitive diagnosis of gout is based upon the identification of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in joint fluid or a tophus. All synovial fluid samples obtained from undiagnosed, inflamed joints should be examined for these crystals. Under polarized light microscopy, the crystals have a needle-like shape and strong negative birefringence. This test is difficult to perform, and often requires a trained technician. The fluid must also be examined relatively quickly after aspiration, as temperature and pH affect their solubility.
Blood tests.
Hyperuricemia is a classic feature of gout. Gout occurs nearly half of the time without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. The usefulness of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 "�"mol/L (7.0 mg/dL) in males and 360 "�"mol/L (6.0 mg/dL) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, renal function, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×109/L (40,000/mm3) has been documented in people with gout.
Differential diagnosis.
The most important diagnosis to rule out in gout is septic arthritis (an infection in the joint). This should be considered in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. A joint fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed to support the diagnosis. Other conditions which present similarly include pseudogout and rheumatoid arthritis. Gouty tophi, especially when not in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma, or other cancers.
Prevention.
Both lifestyle changes and medications can decrease uric acid levels. Dietary and lifestyle choices that are effective include reducing intake of meat and seafood, eating adequate vitamin C, limiting alcohol and fructose consumption, and avoiding obesity. A low-calorie diet in obese men decreased uric acid levels by 100 �mol/L (1.7 mg/dL) on average. Vitamin C intake of 1,500 mg per day decreases the risk of gout by 45%. Coffee, but not tea, consumption is associated with a lower risk of gout. Gout may be secondary to sleep apnea through the release of purines from oxygen-starved cells. Treatment of sleep apnea can lessen the occurrence of gout attacks.
Treatment.
The first goal of treating gout is to reduce the symptoms of an acute attack. Repeated attacks can be prevented by using different drugs that reduce the uric acid levels in the blood. Ice applied for 20 to 30 minutes several times a day decreases pain. Options for immediate treatment include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and steroids. Options for prevention include allopurinol, febuxostat and probenecid. Lowering uric acid levels can cure the disease. Treatment of comorbidities is also important.
NSAIDs.
NSAIDs are the most common treatment for gout. No specific type of NSAID is significantly more or less effective than any other. Improvement may be seen within 4 hours. Treatment is recommended for 1–2 weeks. NSAIDs are not recommended for people with certain other health problems such as bleeding from the stomach, esophagus or intestines, renal failure, or heart failure. While indomethacin has historically been the most commonly used NSAID, ibuprofen may be preferred due to its lack of side effects. A proton pump inhibitor may be given to people at risk of experiencing gastric side effects.
Colchicine.
Colchicine is an alternative treatment for people that are unable to tolerate NSAIDs. Its side effects, primarily gastrointestinal upset limit its use. The occurrence of gastrointestinal upset depends on the dose. The risk of experiencing this side effect can be reduced by using smaller, yet still effective doses. Colchicine may interact with other commonly prescribed drugs such as atorvastatin and erythromycin.
Steroids.
Glucocorticoids (otherwise known as steroids) have been found to be as effective as NSAIDs for treating gout. Glucocorticoids may be used if it is not possible to use NSAIDs. Using glucocorticoids also lead to improvement when it is injected into the joint. A joint infection must be excluded if the condition worsens.
Pegloticase.
Pegloticase (Krystexxa) was approved in the USA to treat gout in 2010. It will be a treatment option for the 3% of people who are intolerant to other medications. Pegloticase is administered as an intravenous infusion every two weeks and has been found to reduce uric acid levels in these people.
Prophylaxis.
A number of medications are useful for preventing further episodes of gout, including xanthine oxidase inhibitor (including allopurinol and febuxostat), and uricosurics (including probenecid and sulfinpyrazone). They are not usually given until one to two weeks after an acute attack has resolved due to concerns that it may worsen attack symptoms. These medications are often used in combination with either an NSAID or colchicine for the first 3–6 months. This treatment is not recommended until a person has suffered two gout attacks, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. This type of treatment is delayed until this point because it is not cost effective to offer this treatment sooner. Urate-lowering measures should be increased until serum uric acid levels are below 300–360 �mol/L (5.0-6.0 mg/dL). This treatment should be continued forever. These medications should be continued even if the person experiences a gout attack while on the medication.
Uricosuric drugs are preferred for treating gout if there is not enough uric acid in the urine defined by a 24-hour collection of urine with less than 800 mg of uric acid. Uricosuric drugs are not recommended if the person has a history of renal stones. A 24-hour urine excretion of more than 800 mg indicates overproduction and xanthine oxidase inhibitors are the preferred drugs for providing treatment. Note that probenecid appears to be less effective than allopurinol.
Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (including allopurinol and febuxostat) block uric acid production. Long term therapy is safe and well tolerated, and can be used in people with reduced renal function or urate stones. Allopurinol has caused hypersensitivity in a small number of individuals. In such cases, the alternative drug febuxostat has been recommended.
Outcomes.
Without treatment, an acute attack of gout will usually resolve in 5 to 7 days. 60% of people will have a second attack within one year. Those with gout are at increased risk of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and renal and cardiovascular disease and at increased risk of death. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears to be simply due to having gout.
Without treatment, acute gout attacks may develop into chronic gout with destruction of joint surfaces, joint deformity, and painless tophi. These tophi occur in 30% of those who are untreated for five years, often in the outer part of the ear, over the outer part of the elbow, or on the Achilles tendons. With aggressive treatment, they may dissolve. Kidney stones also frequently complicate gout, affecting between 10 and 40% of people. Kidney stones occur due to low urine pH promoting the crystallization of uric acid. Other forms of chronic renal dysfunction may occur.
Epidemiology.
Gout affects around 1–2% of the Western population at some point in their lives and it is becoming more common. Rates of gout have about doubled between 1990 and 2010. This rise is believed to be due to increasing life expectancy, changes in diet, and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. A number of factors have been found to influence rates of gout, including age, race, and the season of the year. In men over the age of 30 and women over the age of 50, prevalence is 2%.
In the United States, gout is twice as likely to occur in African American males as it is in European Americans. Rates are high among the peoples of the Pacific Islands and the Māori of New Zealand, but rare in Australian aborigines, despite a higher average concentration of serum uric acid in the aboriginal group. Gout has become common in China, Polynesia, and urban sub-Saharan Africa. Some studies have found that gout attacks occur more frequently in the spring. This has been attributed to seasonal changes in diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and temperature.
History.
The word "gout" was initially used by Randolphus of Bocking, around 1200 AD. It is derived from the Latin word "gutta", meaning "a drop" (of liquid). According to the Oxford English Dictionary, this is derived from humorism and "the notion of the 'dropping' of a morbid material from the blood in and around the joints".
People have been aware of gout since ancient times. Historically, it has been referred to as "the king of diseases and the disease of kings" or "the disease of rich men". The first documentation of the disease is from Egypt in 2,600 BC. in a description of arthritis of the largest toe. The Greek physician Hippocrates around 400 BC. commented on it in his "Aphorisms" and noted its absence in eunuchs (men who have had there testicles removed at a young age) and women before menopause. Aulus Cornelius Celsus (30 AD.) described the linkage with alcohol, later onset in women, and associated kidney problems:
Again thick urine, the sediment from which is white, indicates that pain and disease are to be apprehended in the region of joints or viscera... Joint troubles in the hands and feet are very frequent and persistent, such as occur in cases of podagra and cheiragra. These seldom attack eunuchs or boys before coition with a woman, or women except those in whom the menses have become suppressed... some have obtained lifelong security by refraining from wine, mead and venery.
In 1683, Thomas Sydenham, an English physician, described its occurrence in the early hours of the morning, and its more frequent occurrence in older males:
Gouty patients are, generally, either old men, or men who have so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age - of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery, and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About two o'clock in the morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation, and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers, and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected, and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint, and being worse as the fit comes on.
The Dutch scientist, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, first described the microscopic appearance of urate crystals in 1679. In 1848, English physician Alfred Baring Garrod realized that this excess uric acid in the blood was the cause of gout.
In other animals.
Gout is rare in most other animals due to their ability to produce uricase, which breaks down uric acid. Humans and other great apes don't have this ability, which makes gout common. The "Tyrannosaurus rex" specimen known as "Sue", however, is believed to have suffered from gout.
Research.
A number of new medications are under study for treating gout, including anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept. A man made uricase enzyme (rasburicase) is also available. Its use is limited because it triggers an autoimmune response. Versions of this medication that are less prone to cause allergies are in development.

A training camp is a place where soldiers or sports players go to learn skills. Often, they go there to learn physical action, rather than book subjects they would learn at a school. In major sports like the National Football League, training camp refers to the time before the season starts. 
In the military, Recruit training (also called "basic training" or "boot camp") helps new military personnel get the mental and physical fitnesss they need for their military career. Each military branch in a country usually has its own training program. There are also civilian boot camps for those who want to experience military training without joining the military.

Isaac is a figure in Abrahamic religions, one of the three Patriarchs. He is described in the Bible, in the Book of Genesis (chapters 18-27). He was the son of Abraham and Sarah. God tells them they will have a child but they think they are too old and they laugh. They name the boy Isaac after their laughter. Isaac marries Rebecca, and is the father of Esau and Jacob.

Saul (;, meaning "asked for, prayed for"; ; , "Ṭālūt" or , "Ša'ūl") is a King in the Books of Samuel, 1 Chronicles and the Qur'an. He was the first king of ancient Israel. He reigned from 1047 BC to 1010 BC.
In the Bible, Saul loves and obeys God, until he stops listening to God and becomes greedy, losing God's whole interest for him. Samuel, the prophet, comes and gives him a warning that God is not with him anymore. When turning to leave, Saul grabs Samuel's robe, and it tears. Samuel says (1Samuel15:28~29), "The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors - to one better than you. He who is the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind; for he is not a man, that he should change his mind."
Then the spirit of the Lord departs from Saul, and an evil spirit torments him. Saul takes David the shepherd, and the youngest son of Jesse, into his service to play a harp for him and so that he would be soothed when the evil spirit rests upon him. Later he gets jealous of David, and begins to suspect David as the 'one of your neighbors' that Samuel had mentioned. He grows afraid of David, and finally his jealousy turns to hatred, and he wishes to kill him. But Saul's son Jonathan is bound to David in friendship,which makes his anger fume on Jonathan as well.
Later, Saul dies at the battle against the Philistines, and falls on his own sword because he does not want to be abused by the 'uncircumcised' Philistines.1 Samuel and 2 Samuel give conflicting accounts of Saul's death. In 1 Samuel, and in a parallel account in 1 Chronicles 10, as the defeated Israelites flee, Saul asks his armour bearer to kill him, but he refuses, and so Saul falls upon his own sword. In 2 Samuel, an Amalekite tells David he found Saul leaning on his spear after the battle and delivered the "coup de grâce". David has the Amalekite put to death for accusing himself of killing the anointed king. Saul's three sons, Jonathan, Abinadab, and Melchishua were also killed in the battle (). King David, who hears about the tragedy after the battle, curses the mountain:
The victorious Philistines recover Saul's body as well as those of his three sons who also died in the battle, decapitated them and displayed them on the wall of Beth-shan. They display Saul's armour in the temple of Ashtaroth (an Ascalonian temple of the Canaanites). But at night the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead retrieve the bodies for cremation and burial (). Later on, David takes the bones of Saul and of his son Jonathan and buries them in Zela, in the tomb of his father (). The account in 1 Chronicles summarises by stating that:
Saul's Descendants.
After the death of King Saul his only surving son was proclaimed King of Israel; Ish-bosheth was 40 years old at this time and reigned for two years (). However, after the death of King Saul, the tribe of Judah seceded from the rule of the House of Saul by proclaiming David as its king (), and war ensued (). David's faction eventually prevailed against Ish-bosheth's (), but the war did not come to a close until Abner joined David (). Before the death of Saul, David had been married to Saul's daughter Michal, Ishbosheth's sister, until Saul and David had a falling out and Saul gave her to another man (). Later, at the conclusion of the war with Ishbosheth, David's terms for peace required that Michal be returned to him, and Ish-bosheth complied (). After Abner's death, Ish-bosheth seems to have given up hope of retaining power ().Ish-bosheth was assassinated by two of his own army-captains, Rechab and Baanah (), who expected a reward from David because of this. David, however, refused to give any commendation for high treason; he had both killers hanged with their hands and feet cut off. The head of Ishbosheth was buried in Abner's grave at Hebron. ()Michal was childless.
A famine lasting three years hit Israel during the earlier half of David's reign at Jerusalem. This calamity was believed to have happened because of "Saul and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites." The Gibeonites were not Israelites, but the remnant of the Amorites, which Saul pursued from within Israel. David inquired of the Gibeonites what satisfaction they demanded, and was answered that nothing would compensate for the wrong Saul had done to them but the death of seven of Saul's sons.()
David accordingly delivered up to them the two sons of Saul's Concubine Rizpah (Armoni and Mephibosheth() and five of the sons of Merab, Saul's eldest daughter, whom she bore to Adriel. These the Gibeonites put to death, and hung up their bodies at the sanctuary at Gibeah. () Rizpah thereupon took her place on the rock of Gibeah, and for five months watched the suspended bodies of her children, to prevent them from being devoured by the beasts and birds of prey, () till they were at length taken down and buried by David () in the family grave at Zelah with the bones of Saul and Jonathan. (2 Samuel 21:14).
The only male descendant of Saul to survive was Mephibosheth, Jonathan's lame son (), who was five years old at the time of his father's and grandfather's deaths. In time, he came under the protection of David (). Mephibosheth had a young son, Micah (), who had four sons and descendants named until the ninth generation ().

Pin stripes are a pattern of very thin stripes running in parallel found in cloth. 
Although pin stripes are found in mostly in men's suits, any type of fabric can be pin striped. In baseball, the Chicago Cubs baseball uniforms have had pin stripes since 1907 and they are recognized as the first Major League Baseball team to have pin striping onto a baseball uniform. Many other Major League Baseball teams like the Montreal Expos and New York Yankees later put pin stripes on their own uniforms.

A baseball park, baseball stadium, or ball park / ballpark is a place where baseball is played. It refers to the field of play, seating areas (if any) and any other things added to it. 
The flexible rules about baseball fields (aside from the rigid rules of sizes of basepaths and pitcher's mound) allow ballparks to have their own character and quirks. This happens at all levels of baseball, amateur and especiallyprofessional. This makes each stadium interesting and unique. 
Field.
The baseball field is a grassy field that is about or more in diameter, and is separated into the "infield" (the area nearest to the batter) and the "outfield".
The infield is a square (usually called a "diamond"), with each side being long. In each corner of the square, there is a "base", which is a square with sides of . One of the bases is called home base or home plate, and the sides of the square that touch home plate are extended beyond the two nearest bases until the outfield fence (which is or more away from home plate) to form the foul lines. Most of what happens in a baseball game happens in the area of the field in between the foul lines and the outfield fence, which is called fair territory. All other areas of the field (except the foul lines) are called foul territory.
Major League Ballparks.
Below is a list of all current ballparks for teams of major league baseball.

Children that are actively participating in an armed conflict are called child soldiers. There are different definitions. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child says that this affects all who are 15 years or younger, who directly take part in hostilities. The convention dates from 1989. There is an annex protocol, which raises this to 18 years of age. It dates from 2001. It says that regular troop members must be 18 or older, and those who join voluntarily must be 14 or older. Some groups say that people who help armed groups but do not fight, and that are under 18, are also child soldiers. UNICEF, terre des hommes, and Amnesty International also have this view: Everyone who is a combattant, or who helps, and is under 18, is a child soldier. The Cape Town Principles have an even wider definition: Porters, informants, cooks, and girls who have been forcefully prostituted are child soldiers, too. In that way, they get the status of combatants. On the one hand, this legalizes fighting against them. On the other, this gives them rights when they are captured. They have to be treated according to the Geneva Conventions as "prisoners of war".
War crime.
The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court says that recruiting people below the age of 15 is a war crime, and must be prosecuted. Thomas Lubanga was the first person to be tried for this crime at the court in Den Haag. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison and left prison in 2020.
Numbers.
According to a UN source, 300,000 children were actively participating in armed conflicts, in 1996.
It is estimated that between 10% and 30% of child soldiers are girls. Some estimates say that over 40% of the child soldier population are girls. Of the verified cases presented in the 2023 UN Secretary-General report, girls make up 12.3% of all child soldiers recruited or used by armed groups.
Social groups they are from.
Children who are recruited are often from poorer parts of the population. Because of the conflict, they may have been separated from their parents. They are looking for safety and shelter. Often they are refugees. Also, children are often easier to convince than adults.

The American Latino Media Arts Award, or ALMA Award is an award given to Latino performers (actors, film and television directors, and musicians) who promote positive portrayals of Latinos in the entertainment field. In Spanish, "alma" means spirit or soul.

The Young Artist Award (first known as the Youth In Film Award) is an award given by the Young Artist Foundation. The foundation was started in 1978 to award child actors and singers under the age of 21 for their work in movies, television, theater and music. The foundation also raises money for talented children to go to school.
The were given in October 1979, at the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Hollywood for child actors' and singers' work during the years 1978 and 1979. The will be given on May 4, 2014 at the Sportsmen's Lodge in Southern California for child actors' work during the year 2013.
Young Artist Foundation.
The Young Artist Foundation is a charity started in 1978 by Hollywood Foreign Press member, Maureen Dragone to raise money for child artists to go to special schools to study acting, singing, or other special arts. One of the most well known contributors to give money to the Young Artist Foundation is the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.
Young Artist Awards.
History.
The Young Artist Awards are given every year by the Young Artist Foundation. The awards were called the Youth In Film Awards for the first 20 years, but the name was changed to the Young Artist Awards for the 21st awards in March 2000. The awards are sometimes called the "Kiddie Oscars", because many people believe they are like the Academy Awards for children working in Hollywood.
The awards were started by Maureen Dragone in 1979 to award child actors and singers for their work during the years 1978 and 1979 because she thought child actors didn't have a fair chance to win other awards given to adults like the Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award. Two child actors who had to compete with adults for other awards that year were Ricky Schroder in "The Champ" and Justin Henry in "Kramer vs. Kramer". The awards ceremony was held in November or December for the first 10 years, but the ceremony is now held in March or April.
Statue.
The first Youth In Film Award was a small statue that looked like a small Academy Award. It was a statue of a small golden man holding a wreath in front of his chest and he stood on a very large base that looked like a sports trophy. The new Young Artist Award statue still looks like a small Academy Award, but now the small golden man holds a star over his head and he stands on a much smaller base that is much easier for small children to hold. All the winners are given the golden statue and all the children who are nominated are given a special plaque at the ceremony to remember their nomination.
Voting.
The children that the Young Artist Awards considers nominating must be between the ages of 5 and 21 and are first suggested by the child's agent or manager. Their names must be suggested by the end of January or the middle of February and, one month later, the Young Artist Awards throws a special party to announce the names of the children who they have decided to nominate. The Youth In Film Awards were originally given to young artists up to the age of 21, but the awards are now given to children under the age of 18 most of the time.
Winners are chosen by the Young Artist Association. The association was originally called the Hollywood Women's Photo and Press Club and its members were 88 journalists and photographers who worked in the arts. Today, the Young Artist Association has over 125 members who are journalists, agents, and former child performers. The winners are picked by The Young Artist Association and past nominees who all vote by secret ballot.
Categories.
The first Youth In Film Awards gave awards in 11 competitive categories in 1979. The first categories for child artists were "Best Juvenile Actor and Actress in a Motion Picture", "Best Juvenile Actor and Actress in a TV Series or Special", "Best Juvenile Actor and Actress in a Daytime TV Series", and "Best Male and Female Juvenile Recording Artist". The Youth In Film Awards also gave awards to studios and networks in competitive categories for family friendly movies and television shows.
Today, the number of categories has grown to award "Best Young Actor and Actress in an International Feature Film", "Best Young Actor and Actress in a Short Film", "Best Young Supporting Actor and Actress in Film", "Best Young Ensemble Cast", "Best Young Recurring Actor and Actress in a TV Series", and "Best Young Guest-starring Actor and Actress in a TV Series". Many of the categories have been split to award children age 10 and under in their own separate categories. The Young Artist Awards has also awarded children for their work in other arts over the years, including theater, dance, commercials, journalism, radio and stand-up comedy.
Special Awards.
While the number of acting categories has grown, some competitive categories like "Best Juvenile Recording Artist", "Best Family Motion Picture" and "Best Family TV Series" are no longer awarded. The awards for those categories are now given as special "Honorary" awards. The most well known Young Artist Honorary Awards are the "Jackie Coogan Award", which is given to movie studios, producers or directors for their "Outstanding Contribution To Youth Through Entertainment", and the "Former Child Star Award", which is given as a "Lifetime Achievement Award" to adults who were once child stars.
Ceremony.
The ceremony is held every year in Hollywood and it is the most formal awards ceremony for child actors. The child nominees and their parents are expected to "dress up" in suits or party dresses, and many arrive in long cars called limousines. Reporters and photographers are invited to the red carpet before the show, to take pictures and talk to the child stars when they arrive and sign autographs for fans. The children picked to announce the winners on stage each year are usually the winners from the year before or from the year's list of nominees. After the ceremony is a formal dinner and then dancing with live music performed by popular child singers.
The first Youth In Film Awards were given in October 1979 at a ceremony held at the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Hollywood, California. Other locations for the ceremony over the years are the Ambassador Hotel's Coconut Grove, the Globe Theatre, the Beverly Garland Hotel, and the Sportsmen's Lodge.

A sandbox or sandpit is a small area filled with sand made for children to play in. Sandboxes are often rectangular with wooden sides. They can be installed in the gardens of homes. Sandpits are also very popular for making sandcastles. However, some animals use them for litter trays. Sandboxes can be found in most elementary schools. They can also be made of plastic, and in different shapes.
History.
German sand gardens were the first children's toys used by the public. They were brought to the United States at an unknown time, in Boston.

The batting order, or batting lineup, in baseball is an when nine members of the offense take their turns in batting against the pitcher in an order. The batting order is decided by the manager before the game begins, although sometimes during games, a player substitutes with another player which makes the take the original player's spoy. If a team bats out of order, it is a violation of baseball's rules and subject to penalty. When the whole batting order makes plate appearances (bats against the pitcher) in a single inning, it is called "batting around."
In modern American baseball, some batting positions have nicknames: "leadoff" for first, "cleanup" for fourth, and "last" for ninth. Others are known only by the ordinal numbers.

The beluga whale ("Delphinapterus leucas") is a small, toothed whale that is white as an adult. They are found in coastal areas of the Arctic Ocean, and travel south when the sea ice forms.
Description.
The beluga's body is stout and has a small, blunt head with a small beak, tiny eyes and thick layers of blubber. On their head they have a round shape called the melon. This melon holds oil, and the whale is able to change its shape. Scientists believe that it has something to do with the whale's echolocation system. They have one blowhole. Beluga means "white one" in Russian. Its genus Delphinapterus, means "whale without fins", and the species, "leucas", means "white". The beluga is also called the white whale, the white porpoise, the sea canary (because of its songs), and the squid hound (due to its diet). Unlike most other cetaceans, the beluga's seven neck vertebrae are not fused, giving it a flexible, well-defined neck.
A baby beluga whale, called a calf, is a grey or even brown color when it is born. It will gradually become white over the next five years as it becomes an adult. They grow up to in length and weigh up to . They live for between 35 and 50 years of age. A female beluga whale will have one calf every 3 or 4 years. These are born near the coast, often near the entrance to large rivers. The calfs are fed on milk which is 30% fat.
The beluga whales live in groups, called pods of anywhere from only three whales to large groups of more than 200. they can dive down to depths of and stay underwater for as long as 25 minutes. Polar bears and killer whales are known to hunt beluga whales.
Diet and teeth.
Belugas are toothed whales with 34 teeth. The teeth are not designed for chewing, but for grabbing and tearing prey. They swallow their prey whole. They are opportunistic feeders, eating a varied diet of fish, squid, crustaceans, octopi, and worms. They are both benthic (bottom) and pelagic (oceanic) feeders (in shallow water). Belugas sometimes hunt schools of fish cooperatively in small groups.

The Assyrian Church of the East also called Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East is a Christian church. It is one of the earliest churches to separate from the larger Church. It traces its origins to the See of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, started by Saint Thomas the Apostle as well as Saint Mari and Addai as shown in the Doctrine of Addai. This church is sometimes known as the "Nestorian Church", the "Syrian Church" or the "Persian Church." The church is currently headed by Mar Dinkha IV. 
Other names have been given as well, but they are not accurate. One of these names is Assyrian Orthodox Church, which has led some people to believe that it is part of the Oriental Orthodox community. The church itself does not use the word "Orthodox" in any of its service books or in any of its official correspondence, nor does it use any word which can be translated as "correct faith" or "correct doctrine", the rough translation of the word Orthodox. In India, it is known as the Chaldean Syrian Church. In the West it is often known as the Nestorian Church. The Church itself believes that the term 'Nestorian Church' is chosen badly. 
The Assyrian Church is the original Christian church in what was once Parthia; eastern Iraq and Iran. Geographically its influence stretched to China and India in the Middle Ages: a monument found in Xi'an (Hsi-an), the Tang-period capital of China (originally Chang'an), in Chinese and Syriac described the activities of the church in the 7th and 8th century, while half a millennium later a Chinese monk went from Beijing to Paris and Rome to call for an alliance with the Mongols against the Mamelukes. Before the Portuguese arrival in India in 1498, it provided "East Syrian" bishops to the Saint Thomas Christians. Patriarch Timothy I (727–823) wrote of the large Christian community in Tibet.
The creators of Assyrian theology are Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia. Both taught at Antioch. The normative Christology of the Assyrian church was written by Babai the Great (551–628) and is clearly different from the accusations of dualism directed toward Nestorius: his main christological work is called the 'Book of the Union', and in it Babai teaches that the two "qnome" (essences) are unmingled but everlastingly united in the one "parsopa" (personality) of Christ.

The Chaldean Catholic Church or the Chaldean Church of Babylon (, "") is an Eastern particular church of the Catholic Church, maintaining full communion with the Bishop of Rome and the rest of the Catholic Church. The Chaldean Catholic Church presently has an estimated 600,000 - 700,000 Chaldean Christians.

Pidgin (also known as Gaim) is a instant messaging client that can work on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. The software can use most instant messaging protocols, which will let the user log into different instant messaging services from one program.
The number of Pidgin users is thought to be more than 3 million in 2007.
Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Pidgin is free software.
History.
The program was made in or before 1999 by Mark Spencer, an Auburn University sophomore. It was made to give the features of AOL Instant Messenger for Linux.
Naming dispute.
The original name was GAIM, which stood for GTK+ AOL Instant Messenger. After pressure from AOL, the program was renamed to gaim.
However, on April 6 2007, the project development team announced the results of their talks with AOL. This included some name changes: "gaim" became "Pidgin", "libgaim" became "libpurple", and "gaim-text" became "finch".
Due to the legal problems, version 2.0 of the software was stuck in beta stages. Following the talks, it was said that the first official release of Pidgin 2.0.0 was hoped to happen during the two weeks from April 8, 2007. However, Pidgin 2.0 did not release on time, but on April 22, 2007.
Pidgin 2.0.0 was released on May 3, 2007. This was the first version to be called Pidgin. It also contained a completely new graphics design.

Genesis could mean:

Psychotherapy describes the way specially skilled people called psychotherapists help people who have problems and unhappiness in their lives or who want to improve the quality of their lives and relationships with others.
Psychotherapy means treatment of the mind. It aims to help the person feel better, be braver, happier and more in control of their lives. The main way they do this is by talking to the person who has the problems in a way that they begin to be able to understand themselves better. Some psychotherapists may work with a group of people such as a family who have problems and are unhappy.
Training.
Psychotherapists usually complete their training at the doctoral level through doctor of philosophy programs or medical school, although, some are trained at the master's level. Psychotherapists do not use surgery, or give drugs or electric shocks to the people they help. These methods are used by special medical doctors called psychiatrists, who may also sometimes give psychotherapy.
How it started.
Psychotherapy was started in the west in 1886 by Sigmund Freud, the first modern psychotherapist. Freud was a medical doctor who was trained in neurology. He became certain that hidden thoughts in the brain (which he called the Unconscious) could cause physical symptoms and strange behavior in some people. He believed that human behavior was not all caused by the brain, but by things that happened to people when they were babies and young children. His research of this theory -the idea he had- led him to create "talking therapy" , where he tried to figure out what could cause the mind to do things like this. Freud thought that his figuring things out and telling the patients what had caused the behavior would cure the patient. Unfortunately, it usually made no lasting changes. 
This is why modern psychologists have gradually figured out many other ways of helping their patients and modified their techniques through methods other than psychotherapy. Hans Eysenck has suggested psychotherapy is discredited.

Trousers (or pants in Canada, South Africa and the United States), are a kind of clothing. They are worn on the lower part of the body, to cover both legs apart (instead of cloth stretching across both as in skirts and dresses). 
Historically, in the West, trousers have been the lower-body clothing item for men since the 16th century; by the late 20th century, they were used sometimes by women as well. Trousers are worn at the hips or waist, and may be held up by their own by a belt, or braces (suspenders). 

The Epistle (or letter) to the Philippians is a short book in the New Testament. It is a letter to the church at Philippi in Macedonia from Saint Paul. It was written while Paul was in jail for telling people about Jesus.
Author.
Most everyone thinks that Paul wrote what is in the book. Some think it was a single lettter, but others think that it puts together three letters into one. The letter or letters were written in Greek in about 50 to 60 A.D.
Contents.
In Chapters 1 and 2 of Philippians, Paul tells the Philippians that he is about to be tried in Rome. He says he is not afraid of death. He tells the readers to be happy no matter what happens. He says that being in jail is helping to spread the Christian message, rather than stopping it. He says that Epaphroditus is a hard worker and is a hero. The Philippian church had sent Epaphroditus to visit Paul and bring him gifts. Some time during his visit with Paul, Epaphroditus got sick. But he got better before being sent back to the Philippians.
In Chapter 3, Paul warns the Philippians about those Christians who insist that circumcision is necessary for salvation. Circumcision is the removal of skin from the male sex organ for religious reasons. It is practiced by Jews and Muslims. He testifies that he once was a strong follower of this and other Jewish laws, but he now considers these things to be like trash compared to the gospel of Jesus. He says that being right with God comes from faith in Jesus and not by keeping religious laws.
In Chapter 4, Paul tells the Philippians to get along with each other. In the last part of the chapter, Paul thanks the Philippians for gifts they had sent him, and tells them that God will reward them for being kind to him.
Paul seems to feel happy in the letter and he is hopeful that he will get out of jail, and so he says he will send Timothy to the Philippians to help them, and thinks he will also pay them a visit.
Christ poem.
Chapter 2 of the epistle contains a famous poem telling who Christ is and what he did to save us. Paul says we should follow this example of humble service.
Because of its style, scholars agree that this is an early Christian poem that was written by someone before Paul's writings, as early as the 40s AD. The Christ poem is important because it strongly suggests that there were very early Christians who understood Jesus to be a God like being who chose to take on human form, rather than a human who was later raised to a divine status.

Location.
Dajabón is bordered to the north by the Monte Cristi province, to the east by the Santiago Rodríguez province and to the south by the Elías Piña province. To the west Dajabón borders the Republic of Haiti.
History.
For a very long time, very few people lived in this region because it was on the border between two countries: first, between the French colony of "Saint-Domingue" and the Spanish colony of "Santo Domingo" and later between the two independent countries of Haiti and Dominican Republic. There were many fights here between the armies of the two parts of the island and some important battles were held close to the city of Dajabón during the Dominican Independence War.
In 1861, the Dominican Republic became again a colony of Spain. The Restoration War, or just the "Restoration", started on 16 August 1863, in a hill near the hamlet of "Capotillo". The Spanish army left the country in 1865.
After the "Restoration", people came to live in this area and several towns were created.
When the province was created in 1938, it had three municipalities: Dajabón, Loma de Cabrera and Restauración. In 1996, Partido was made a municipality and later, in 2002, El Pino became another municipality.
The municipal districts of the province were created in:

, the total estimated propulation of the province is 65,519 inhabitants.
The largest city of the province is Dajabón, its head municipality or capital, with a population (in 2010) of 25,245 inhabitants.
Geography.
The Dajabón province has a total area of . It has 2.1% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 23rd (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province. The altitude of the city of Dajabón, provincial capital, is .
The Cordillera Central ("Central mountain chain") is in the southern part ofthe province. The northern part is flat, with many savannas; it is part of the "Yaque del Norte Valley" (or "Línea Noroeste").
There are two main roads in the province. One, from north to south, comes from the Monte Cristi province and goes through the cities of Dajabón, Loma de Cabrera and Restauración and then goes into the Elías Piña province. In some parts, the road marks the border with Haiti.
The second main road begins in Santiago de la Cruz and goes to the east through Partido and El Pino and then through the Santiago Rodríguez and Valverde provinces to end in the "Carretera Duarte" (Duarte National Road), one of the most important road of the country and that goes from Santo Domingo to Monte Cristi.
Rivers.
The only important river in the province is the Dajabón River, also known as "Masacre" (from French "Massacre"). This river marks the Dominican-Haitian border from the city of Dajabón to its mouth. Other rivers are very short and they are tributaries of the Dajabon or the Artibonite rivers.
Climate.
The climate of the province is a tropical climate, hot most of the year, but it is cooler on the mountains..
Municipalities.
There are 5 municipalities and 4 municipal districts (M.D.) in the province. The municipalities and its municipal districts (M.D.) are:

Patton (UK: Patton: Lust for Glory) is a 1970 movie about United States Army General George S. Patton, and his role in the Second World War. "Patton" starred George C. Scott in the title role, and it was released by 20th Century Fox. The movie became very popular, and won an Academy Award for Best Picture in 1971. A sequel, "The Last Days of Patton", appeared in 1986, also starring Scott.
Beginnings.
Patton's widow was approached not long after her husband died (after an automobile accident), with an offer to make a Hollywood movie about Patton's life and career. His family did not agree right away, and it was many years before they approved a dramatic movie to be made. The movie's screenplay was based on a well-written biography of General Patton, "Patton: Ordeal and Triumph", and "A Soldier's Story", a memoir by General Omar N. Bradley, who served with Patton.
Storyline.
The story covers the time from the American defeat at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass in North Africa during 1943, when Patton was sent to take command, through his victories in Africa and Sicily, his time as a "decoy" before D-Day, The Battle of the Bulge, and his last weeks, after the war was over in 1945.
The movie did not give much time to showing combat and battles, but explained Patton's role in several important battles and campaigns. It also showed his character as a person, as a soldier, and as a leader. Patton made good choices, such as appointing Omar Bradley to assist him, and bad choices, such as striking soldiers physically when they showed fear or cowardice, or giving his personal opinions to the media, when they differed widely from what the Allied commanders expected. The movie showed a mix of both bad and good things about Patton.
Reception.
The movie appeared nearly twenty-five years after Patton died. American attitudes toward war, toward fighting, and toward the military had changed in many ways. The Vietnam War was happening at the same time the movie was made and shown. The older generation, who had fought in World War II or helped out on the , tended to support the war and the draft, which made young American men join the Army to fight. Younger people, who did not remember World War II or were born after it ended, were mostly against the war in Vietnam. "Patton" gave older and younger viewers a look back at an American war hero and leader, and it gave them things to think and talk about together.

However, his ancestors supposedly immigrated to modern India, during the reign of Afghan Emperor Shahabuddin Ghouri from the district of Ghour of present Afghanistan. He was born in Bhopal State in British India in 1936. His father Abdul Ghafoor Khan served in the Education Department, British India, and after retirement, settled in Bhopal.
He remained under arrest in Pakistan for quite some time, because he was accused of Nuclear proliferation to the North Korean government and also to Iran. 
In August 2021, Khan was hospitalized in Islamabad after testing positive for COVID-19. He died at the age of 85 in Islamabad from the infection on October 10, 2021.
Several politicians in Pakistan, including the Prime Minister Imran Khan stated their tribute to him. In a post on Twitter, Imran Khan stated

It was the eleventh and last event with the "Backlash" name. Backlash would later be replaced by Extreme Rules in 2010.

Celery is a type of vegetable, often used in salad.

 is a first person rail shooter made by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 game console. It is about a Pokémon photographer who has to take pictures of all the Pokémon on an island. It only features about 63 of the 151 Pokémon that existed at the time the game was made. Players could take their pictures to either Blockbuster (in North America) or Lawson (in Japan) to have them printed.
The game was released for the Wii's Virtual Console service in 2007. Players can send pictures taken in the game to the Wii's Message Board and share them with friends. 

The Big Mac is a kind of sandwich, better known as hamburger, sold at the fast food-chain McDonald's. It is 550 calories, and is made using two beef patties, Big Mac Sauce, dehydrated onions, shredded lettuce, sliced pickles, and a slice of cheese. Also, the Big Mac Index is measured in how much a Big Mac costs in foreign currencies.
The Big Mac was created by Jim Delligatti, one of Ray Kroc's earliest franchisees, who was the owner of some restaurants in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area. It was designed to compete with a similar Big Boy sandwich. Customer response to the Big Mac was so good that it was begun to be made nationally in 1967. One of its well-known and unique features is a middle slice of bread ("club" layer) used to make sure the contents do not move about and to prevent spills.
Officer Big Mac.
Officer Big Mac is a character from McDonaldland, a fictional universe made by McDonald's for its ads. He came out in 1971. He looks like "Mayor McCheese", the mayor of McDonaldland. As the chief of police, he's in charge of keeping order and stopping the "Hamburglar" from stealing hamburgers.
Other names.
Originally, the Big Mac had two different names that didn't do well in the market: "the Aristocrat" and "Blue Ribbon Burger". The third name, Big Mac, was suggested by Esther Glickstein Rose, a 21-year-old secretary at McDonald's headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois.

Stormbreaker is a 2005 British movie based on the Anthony Horowitz novel "Stormbreaker", part of the Alex Rider series of books.
Plot.
The plot is the same as the novel.
Changes.
There are some changes from the novel. For example, the main bad guy, Sayle, is changed from Lebanese to American, since the actor picked did not have a Lebanese accent.

A divertimento is a piece of music which is lighthearted and easy to listen to. It is often performed on social occasions, e.g. as music to be played while people eat, or as after-dinner music.
The divertimento became popular in the 18th century. They were played by a small group of instruments. Mozart wrote several pieces called "divertimento". They are similar to a serenade. A divertimento often has several movements, e.g. six, seven or more.
There are a few examples from the 20th century of pieces called "divertimento", e.g. works by including works by Ferruccio Busoni, Béla Bartók, and Igor Stravinsky (from his ballet "Le Baiser de la Fée").

Germany's Next Topmodel (also known as GNTM) is a German reality television program. It is hosted by supermodel Heidi Klum. The program is based on the American series "America's Next Top Model". The first cycle (season) was in 2006. The 18th cycle began in February 2023. 
Overview.
A group of girls are chosen to live together for a few weeks and compete to become "Germany's Next Topmodel". Each week, one girl is asked to leave because she is not good enough to stay in the competition and become a top model. The last three/four girls are in the finale. The winner is then chosen with help of the group of judges. There have been 18 cycles of the show so far.
Host and judges.
Only Heidi Klum has been a judge on every cycle. Thomas Hayo was a judge for the longest at six cycles, Peyman Amin was next longest at four cycles. Boris Entrup was a judge for cycle two, but he was part of the program until 2017 as the makeup advisor. In 2017 Wolfgang Joop became the first former judge to return to the program. He had been a guest judge for one episode. He came back in 2018 as well.
The judging panel since the 14th season was only guest judges and Klum. She was the only permanent judge.

Hornblende is a complex series of silicate minerals.
Hornblende is not a recognized mineral in its own right, but the name is used as a general or field term, to refer to a dark amphibole.
It is an isomorphous mixture of three molecules; a calcium-iron-magnesium silicate, an aluminium-iron-magnesium silicate, and an iron-magnesium silicate.
Hornblende has a hardness of 5–6, a specific gravity of 2.9–3.4 and is typically an opaque green, greenish-brown, brown or black color. It is most often confused with the minerals augite and biotite mica, both of which are black and can be found in granite.
Occurrence.
Hornblende is a common constituent of many igneous and metamorphic rocks such as granite, diorite, gabbro, basalt, andesite, gneiss, and schist. It is the principal mineral of amphibolites.
Very dark brown to black hornblendes that contain titanium may be called basaltic hornblende, from the fact that they are usually a constituent of basalt and related rocks.
Etymology.
The word hornblende is derived from the German "horn" and "blenden", to 'blind' or 'dazzle'. The term "blende" is often used to refer to a brilliant non-metallic luster, for example, zincblende and pitchblende, the ore of uranium.

Particles which go near the speed of light are called ultrarelativistic.
The ultrarelativistic limit is the maximum velocity that a particle can move at. Albert Einstein found the equation for energy: E=mc2. This means that energy is equal to a certain amount of mass. However, this is a simplified version of his equation. The longer version of his equation is E2=m2c4+p2c2. (Mathematically, if you ignore the p2c2 and take the square root of the equation, you get E=mc2). p2c2 refers to the velocity of a particle multiplied by a very large number. 
Einstein then went on to show that a particle can never achieve the speed of light, because you get a divide by zero error from the equation for kinetic energy, formula_1.
Look at the denominator (bottom) of the equation, formula_2. "v" refers to the velocity of the particle. If its velocity reaches the speed of light (which is "c" in this equation), formula_3 will equal one, and since that would leave one minus one in the denominator, there would be a divide by zero error.
Particles which go below the speed of light (all particles which have mass) are called tardyons. Theoretical particles which go above the speed of light are called tachyons.

On January 4, 2019, Roberts announced that he will not seek reelection in 2020.

Monitor lizards, the genus Varanus, are also known as biawak or goannas. They are members of the family Varanidae. Their closest living relatives are the anguid and "Heloderma" lizards.
"Varanus" is a genus of largely carnivorous lizards. There are about 60 species in 10 subgenera. The species cover a vast area, occurring through Africa, the Indian Subcontinent, to China, down Southeast Asia to Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, New Guinea, Australia and islands of the Indian Ocean, and the South China Sea. A large concentration of monitor lizards occurs on Tioman Island in the Malaysian state of Pahang. Some are now found in South Florida, particularly in the Everglades.
Monitor lizards have long necks, powerful tails and claws, and well-developed limbs. The species include the largest living lizard, the Komodo dragon, and the crocodile monitor. 
Most species are terrestrial, but arboreal and semi-aquatic monitors are also known. International trade in five species is banned, and all the others are threatened species.

The Lancia Thema is a car produced by Lancia. It replaced the Lancia Gamma in 1984, and were replaced by the Lancia Kappa in 1994.

Christopher Roy Oddleifson (born September 7, 1950 in Brandon, Manitoba) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey player. He in the National Hockey League from 1972 until 1981. He is best known for his time with the Vancouver Canucks, where he was one of the team's top players for much of the 1970s and served as team captain in 1976–77.
Playing career.
Oddleifson was selected 10th overall in the 1970 NHL Amateur Draft by the California Golden Seals following a final junior season with the Winnipeg Jets of the WCHL, during which he finished with 95 points (including a league-leading 64 assists) and 243 penalty minutes. However, he was assigned to the minor leagues and would never play an National Hockey League game for the Seals, and was dealt to the Boston Bruins mid-way through the 1971–72 season.
In 1972–73, Oddleifson finally made his NHL debut, appearing in 6 games for Boston without recording a point. He managed to crack the Bruins full-time in 1974–75, highlighted by a four-goal game against the Golden Seals, the team that had given up on him two years earlier. Late in the season, he was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks in a deal for sniper Bobby Schmautz, and he finished out his rookie season with decent totals of 13 goals and 29 points in 70 games between Boston and Vancouver.
Oddleifson would have his breakout year in 1974–75, as he emerged as a leader on a young Canuck team which surprised by winning their division and making the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. He proved himself to be an exceptional all-around player who possessed size, toughness, and playmaking ability, as well as the ability to play both at center and on the wing. He lead the Canucks in scoring through the early part of the season, until a fractured jaw forced him to miss 20 games. Nevertheless, he finished with career highs of 16 goals and 35 assists for 51 points in just 60 games.
In 1975–76, Oddleifson would have his finest NHL season, as he notched 16 goals and a club-leading 46 assists for a career high 62 points. Although his production waned somewhat in the next few seasons, he remained one of the team's top all-around forwards and most popular players. He was named team captain for 1976–77, although he was replaced by Don Lever the following year. In 1977–78, he recorded a career-high 17 goals for the club.
By the 1979–80 season, the emergence of young stars like Thomas Gradin, Stan Smyl and Curt Fraser, as well as the acquisition of several skilled veterans, had pushed Oddleifson into a mainly defensive role, and he finished the season with career lows of just 8 goals and 28 points. Early in the 1980–81 campaign, he was assigned to the Dallas Black Hawks, effectively ending his NHL career.
Oddleifson spent two more seasons playing in Switzerland before retiring in 1983. He finished his NHL career with totals 95 goals and 191 assists for 286 points in 524 games, along with 464 penalty minutes.
Following his career, Oddleifson returned to Vancouver and became a successful real estate agent. He remains active with the Canuck Oldtimers squad.

A tube worm is a worm-like sessile invertebrate which anchors its tail to an underwater surface. It creates a mineral tube around its body, and can withdraw the body into it.
Tube worms are found in these groups:

Leviathan (, "twisted, coiled"), is a monster mentioned in the Bible. In Satanism Leviathan is believed to be one of the princes of Hell. The word has become synonymous with any large sea monster or creature. In classical literature (such as the novel "Moby-Dick") it refers to great whales, and in Modern Hebrew, it means simply "whale."

A Group 11 element is one in the series of elements in group 11 (IUPAC style) in the periodic table, consisting of transition metals which are the traditional coinage metals of copper (Cu), silver (Ag), and gold (Au). Roentgenium (Rg) belongs to this group of elements based on its electronic configuration, but it is a short-lived transactinide with a 22.8 seconds half-life that has only been observed in laboratory conditions. The name "coinage metals" is often used in casual speech to refer to these elements, but various cultures have used many other metals in coinage including aluminium, lead, nickel, stainless steel, and zinc.
History.
All the elements of the group except Roentgenium have been known since prehistoric times, as all of them occur in metallic form in nature and no extraction metallurgy has to be used to produce them.
Characteristics.
Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in its electron configuration, especially the outermost shells resulting in trends in chemical behavior:
They are all relatively inert, corrosion-resistant metals. Copper and gold are colored.
These elements have low electrical resistivity so they are used for wiring. Copper is the cheapest and most widely used. Bond wires for integrated circuits are usually gold. Silver and silver plated copper wiring are found in some special applications.
Applications.
These metals, especially silver, have unusual properties that make them essential for industrial applications outside of their monetary or decorative value. They are all excellent conductors of electricity. The most conductive of all metals are silver, copper and gold in that order. Silver is also the most thermally conductive element, and the most light reflecting element. Silver also has the unusual property that the tarnish that forms on silver is still highly electrically conductive. 
Copper is used extensively in electrical wiring and circuitry. Gold contacts are sometimes found in precision equipment for their ability to remain corrosion-free. Silver is used widely in mission-critical applications as electrical contacts, and is also used in photography (because silver nitrate reverts to metal on exposure to light), agriculture, medicine, audiophile and scientific applications.
Gold, silver, and copper are quite soft metals and so are easily damaged in daily use as coins. Precious metal may also be easily abraded and worn away through use. In their numismatic functions these metals must be alloyed with other metals to afford coins greater durability. The alloying with other metals makes the resulting coins harder, less likely to become deformed and more resistant to wear.
Gold coins: Gold coins are typically produced as 90% gold (e.g. with pre-1933 US coins), or 22 carat (92%) gold (e.g. current collectible coins and Krugerrands), with copper and silver making up the remaining weight in each case. Bullion gold coins are being produced with up to 99.999% gold (in the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf series).
Silver coins: Silver coins are typically produced as either 90% silver - in the case of pre 1965 US minted coins (which were circulated in many countries), or sterling silver (92.5%) coins for pre-1920 British Commonwealth and other silver coinage, with copper making up the remaining weight in each case.
Copper coins: Copper coins are often of quite high purity, around 97%, and are usually alloyed with small amounts of zinc and tin.
Inflation has caused the face value of coins to fall below the hard currency value of the historically used metals. This had led to most modern coins being made of base metals - copper nickel (around 80:20, silver in color) is popular as are nickel-brass (copper (75), nickel (5) and zinc (20), gold in color), manganese-brass (copper, zinc, manganese, and nickel), bronze, or simple plated steel.

A smartphone is a mobile phone that can also be used as a computer. They work as a computer but are mobile devices small enough to fit in a user's hand. They use a System on a chip or Minimal instruction set computer so they can be small.
Uses include:
Another way to think of them is that they are PDAs that can make voice calls like any other mobile phone. Older phones also used computer technology, but lacked many of the parts of a computer that were too big to fit into a phone. Modern phone makers have been able to use smaller parts. Most smartphones are also GPS receivers and digital cameras.
Because smartphones are small computers, they run an operating system that is often common between devices to ensure compatibility. The majority of smartphones run on Apple iOS or Google Android but others use Windows Phone or BlackBerry OS. Most can do multitasking, running more than one program which helps the user do things quicker and easier. Users can get more programs, called mobile apps, from the manufacturer's app store, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play which can help them complete special tasks. 
Data communication has become faster. Smart phones can send and receive data much faster than older phones. The industry uses different standards to label the data transmission rates. 2G was introduced in 1991. 2G means "2nd Generation". 2G phones transmit data at about the same speed as a 56kbit/s (kilobits per second) dial-up modem would get.
3G was introduced in the early 2000s. Depending on where they are, 3G phones vary in speed between about 200kbit/s to 14Mbit/s (megabits per second). This is comparable to a DSL or low end cable modem speed. Most smart phones use 3G technology to make them fast enough to practically use internet and other data features. Faster 4G networks operate in many places, with speeds estimated as fast as 100Mbit/s to 1Gbit/s (gigabit per second). This is as fast as some computer networks that use ethernet. Many smart phones introduced after 2010 use 4G technology including LTE, as later, even faster version. 5G was introduced in a few places in 2019.
Smartphones are powered by batteries. The amount of energy they can store is reduced over time, and they become weaker. This causes the phone to become slower and later to turn itself off without the user asking for it. Some smartphones are designed so the user is able to take off the rear cover and replace the weakened battery. Most newer smartphones are not made like this.
Use as camera.
Smartphones also works as a camera. They are usually not as capable as dedicated cameras. Some phones have sophisticated camera software allowing such features as independent setting of bitrate, framerate and resolution. Such controls have only been adapted starting in the mid-2010s. As of early 2021, mobile phone chipsets may be capable of 2160p 4K video capture at 120 frames per second.

The Dodge B-Series, also marketed as the Dodge Ram Van, was a series line of passenger or cargo vans which began around 1971 and ended in 2003. These vans were full sized. They had the names of Sportsman for the passenger van. The cargo vans were named Dodge Tradesman. This was before 1979, beginning in which year these vehicles were renamed Dodge Ram Van. The vehicles were marketed under Dodge. The B-Series vans were discontinued in June of 2003 and replaced with the Dodge Sprinter, which is a rebadged version of the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, which has been on sale since 2002, las the model line currently competes with the Chevrolet Van, Chevrolet Express, Ford Econoline, and GMC Savana.

Seventh Son of a Seventh Son is a studio album by Iron Maiden. It went on sale on 11 April 1988.
It is a concept album, and talks about the idea that a seventh son of a seventh son has special powers. The album was the most popular one in th eUnited Kingdom when it went on sale.
The album got good reviews. One person who reviewed it said that "ranks among [Iron Maiden's] best work."

America's Got Talent (sometimes abbreviated as AGT) is an American reality television series on the NBC television network, and part of the global British ""Got Talent" series" franchise. It began in June 21, 2006. It features singers, dancers, magicians and other talents from America to compete for a contract and $1,000,000 and as a headliner on the Las Vegas Strip since season 3.
Format.
Artists compete for the judges votes. Before appearing, Applicants must audition to impress the crew who works on the show. This is how people get a chance to impress the judges. 
Note: Certain seasons may have different variations of rounds.
Auditions.
Once applicants have made the show, they go on stage with the judges. Before the act, they introduce themselves("Who are you and where are you from?") is a common line. They perform their act with added help from the crew that helps the contestants with playing music, and props. The coaches have a big red X button they can press if the act starts performing and they get bored, don't like the act, or think the act isn't "talent" material or just plain stupid. If an act receives all of the Judges X's, they must stop performing, however, some have ignored the unofficial rule. After the act is complete, the judges make comments make positive and/or negative about it. Each judge then votes. If an act received 3 Yes's(75%) or more, they move on to the next round of competition. If an act received 2 yes's(50%) or less, they are eliminated from the competition. X's do not determine a judge's yes or no decision. Even if an act received four X's, they can still go through if they can convince the judges to give them 3 yes's, they still go through.
Judge Cuts.
The second round of the competition features the contestants performing an act again(usually better and bigger) than the last time. The Judges decide on a certain number of acts moving to the live shows. The contestants are usually split into a certain number of groups as well. The judges decide who moves on as a group, instead of individually. The judges can still X a performance, but all performances are eligible to move on when the judges X a performance, even with four X's.

The Calvin cycle (also known as the Benson-Calvin cycle) is the set of chemical reactions that take place in chloroplasts during photosynthesis. 
The cycle is light-independent because it takes place after the energy has been captured from sunlight. 
The Calvin cycle is named after Melvin Calvin, who won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for finding it in 1961. Calvin and his colleagues, Andrew Benson and , did the work at the University of California, Berkeley.
Context.
Using the radioactive carbon-14 isotope as a tracer, Calvin, Andrew Benson and their team mapped the complete route that carbon travels through a plant during photosynthesis. They traced the carbon-14 from soaking up its atmospheric carbon dioxide to its conversion into carbohydrates and other organic compounds. The single-celled algae "Chlorella" was used to trace the carbon-14.
The Calvin group showed that sunlight acts on the chlorophyll in a plant to fuel the manufacture of organic compounds, not directly on carbon dioxide as previously believed.
Steps.
The steps in the cycle are as follows:
1. Grab: A five-carbon carbon catcher called RuBP (Ribulose bisphosphate) catches one molecule of carbon dioxide and forms a six-carbon molecule.
2. Split: the enzyme RuBisCO (with the energy of ATP and NADPH molecules) breaks the six-carbon molecule into two equal parts.
3. Leave: A trio of carbons leave and become sugar. The other trio moves on to the next step.
4. Switch: Using ATP and NADPH, the three-carbon molecule is changed into a five-carbon molecule.
5. The cycle starts over again.
The product.
The carbohydrate products of the Calvin cycle are three-carbon sugar phosphate molecules, or 'glucose triose phosphates' (G3P). Each step of the cycle has its own enzyme which speeds up the reaction.

Hall &amp; Oates is an American musical group. The members are Daryl Hall and John Oates. They came from Philadelphia. Their greatest fame was from the late 1970s to mid 1980s. During this time they had many hit songs. They faded from view in 1990, but the duo are still performing together.

Fernando Wood (14 June 1812 – 14 February, 1881) was an American politician of the Democratic Party from Pennsylvania. He served as the Mayor of New York City twice (1855 – 1857, 1860 – 1862), United States Representative three times (1841–1843, 1863–1865, and 1867–1881) and as Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means in both the 45th and 46th United States Congress (1877–1881). He was head of the political machine Tammany Hall. In 1854 he was elected Mayor of New York City and took office in 1855. He ran again in 1856, but lost to Daniel F. Tiemann, who was mayor from 1857 to 1859. Wood was re-elected in 1860 and took office again that year, for the last time. After being a mayor, Wood returned to the United States Congress. He died at the age of 68.

The Ford Expedition is a full sized SUV that can carry up to nine people. This SUV debuted around 1997 as a replacement for Ford Bronco. The vehicle is used by EMS, by law enforcement and by fire department agencies.

The 2010–11 Queensland floods were a series of floods in Australia which began in December 2010 and ended in January 2011. The majority of the floods were in Queensland including its capital city, Brisbane. The rain also caused floods further south in central and western Victoria. At least 90 towns flooded. A huge area of Queensland, the size of Texas and France combined, was flooded. The floods forced thousands of people to leave their homes. At least 70 towns and 200,000 people were affected in Queensland. Three-quarters of the state of Queensland has been declared a disaster zone. The 2010–2011 floods have killed 35 (not 30) people across Queensland since November and 14 are still missing. More than 20 people have died in flash floods between Brisbane and Toowoomba.
The floods were caused by heavy rain from tropical cyclone "Tasha" that joined with a trough during a La Niña event. La Niña is an unusual weather pattern, which brings wet weather to eastern Australia. The 2010 La Niña was the strongest since 1973. This caused heavy rainfall across Queensland. December 2010 was the wettest on record, with 107 places getting their highest rainfalls ever. The state average rainfall level of 404.7mm was much bigger than the old record of 369mm set in 1975. 2010 was also recorded as the state's wettest spring since 1900 and Australia's third wettest year. Flooding started across parts of the state in early December. On 28 December a monsoonal trough crossed the coast from the Coral Sea, bringing very heavy rain from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the Gold Coast.
About 300 roads were closed, including nine major highways. Many places, including Condamine and Chinchilla were flooded several times. Coal railway lines were closed and many mine sites flooded. The floods have caused fruit and vegetable prices to rise as crops have been destroyed. The wet conditions have also led to a large number of snakes seeking safety on the higher ground or in houses with people. Saltwater crocodiles and sharks were seen in some flooded areas of towns.
Flooding in the Fitzroy River.
The flooding forced 8,000 people to leave Theodore, Queensland Theodore and other towns. The military transported people by helicopter to an evacuation centre at Moura, Queensland. The total evacuation of a Queensland town had never happened before.
Emerald, Queensland was cut-off by road on 29 December as the Nogoa River rose. The next day, the river level rose above the 2008 flood peak level of . At the peak of the flooding, 80% of the town was flooded, the worst the town ever experienced. 1,200 people from Emerald were listed as evacuees.
Rockhampton had nearly a week to get ready for the flood peak from the Fitzroy River, which flows through the centre of the city. The airport was closed on 1 January. A metal flood barrier was set up to protect the buildings. An evacuation centre was set up at the Central Queensland University. The Bruce Highway leading south out of Rockhampton was closed to traffic. The river reached just short the of the predicted maximum.
The Port of Gladstone cut back its coal exports because the coal piles at the port were too wet and further coal deliveries could not be made by rail. The Goonyella railway line which is used by a number of coal mines in the Bowen Basin was closed for one week and shipments of grain were also stopped.
Burnett River - The River of Magic Water.
The towns of Gayndah, Queensland and Mundubbera, Queensland when the Burnett River flooded on 28–29 December. The river peaked at at Mundubbera. This was the highest river height since 1942 and flooded more than 20 houses. Downstream at Gayndah, the river peaked at with floodwaters reaching two houses. Both towns were isolated for several days and there was major disruption to the drinking water supply and local agricultural production.
Bundaberg had its worst flooding in 40 years, after the Burnett River flooded the city. Floodwater forced 300 households to leave their homes .

Rod R. Blagojevich (born December 10, 1956) was 40th Governor of Illinois beginning January 13, 2003 and ending January 29, 2009. He succeeded George Ryan, who would also be arrested for non-related charges. Blagojevich was the first Governor of Illinois to be impeached while in office and the first Democratic politician in over 25 years to face such charges. In February 2020, President Donald Trump ended Blagojevich's prison sentence four years earlier.
Early life.
Blagojevich was born in Chicago, Illinois, the second of four children. His father, Radislav, was an immigrant steel plant laborer from a village near Kragujevac, Serbia. Blagojevich graduated from Chicago's Foreman High School after transferring from Lane Technical High School. He began boxing at a young age.
Governor of Illinois.
During 2002, Blagojevich campaigned for his party's nomination to become governor. Blagojevich won a close primary campaign against former Illinois Attorney General Roland Burris and Chicago Public Schools Superintendent Paul Vallas, who ran well in the suburban collar counties of Chicago. Blagojevich finished strongly in Southern Illinois, winning 55% of the primary vote downstate, enough to win a primary victory by a thin margin.
In the general election, Blagojevich defeated Topinka and the Green Party's Rich Whitney, outspending Topinka $27 million to $6 million. He attempted to tie Topinka to former Republican governor George Ryan's corruption. Blagojevich won re-election.
Arrest and conviction.
He was arrested in December 2008 on federal corruption charges, including conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Blagojevich was later impeached during January 2009, convicted and removed from office on January 29, 2009. On December 7, 2011, Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in federal prison. He is held at Federal Correctional Institution, Englewood in Jefferson County, Colorado.
On May 31, 2018, President Donald Trump, soon after having pardoned commentator Dinesh D'Souza, told reporters that he was considering reducing Blagojevich's sentence (without pardoning him). Trump called Blagojevich's 14-year sentence "unfair", saying that Blagojevich's statements about enriching himself were "stupid", but also the sort of thing "that many other politicians say".
President Donald Trump commuted his sentence on February 18, 2020, ending his sentence four years early.
Personal life.
Blagojevich has been married to Patricia Mell Blagojevich. They have two children. His family owns a home in Ravenswood, Chicago, but live in Jefferson County, Colorado because of Blagojevich's prison stay.

The Daintree Rainforest is a tropical rainforest in Queensland, Australia. At around 1200 square kilometres the Daintree is the largest continuous area of tropical rainforest on the Australian mainland. It is named after Richard Daintree, an Australian geologist and photographer.
The Daintree Rainforest is a main part of the Wet Tropics of Queensland, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988. These are some of its ancient flora:
The Daintree Rainforest itself meets all four natural criteria on the "Criteria for Selection to be a World Heritage Site", though it is just part of the Wet Tropics site. The Wet Tropics are one of only twelve natural World Heritage Sites in the world which meet all four criteria. The Daintree area is next to another World Heritage site, the Great Barrier Reef. This makes it the only place in the world where two natural World Heritage Sites meet. 
The Daintree Rainforest contains 30% of the frog, marsupial and reptile species in Australia, and 65% of Australia's bat and butterfly species. 18% of bird species in the country can be found in this area. There are also over 12,000 species of insects. All of this diversity is contained within an area that takes up 0.2% of Australia.
The Daintree Rainforest is extremely ancient; it is thought to be over one hundred and thirty-five million years old. About 430 species of birds live among the trees. The primitive flowering plants "Austrobaileya scandens" and "Idiospermum australiense" are also endemic to the Daintree.
The forest is north of Mossman, Queensland, on the coast, north of Cairns in the tropical far north of Australia. Part of the forest is protected by the Daintree National Park and drained by the Daintree River.
The Daintree Rainforest is loosely defined as the area between the Mossman Gorge and the Bloomfield River. The roads north of the Daintree River wind through areas of lush forest, and have been designed to minimize damage to the forest.
The Daintree Region is home to a number of rare and endangered species, including the southern cassowary and Bennett's tree-kangaroo. It is listed as an important bird area, but might just as well be listed for its fungi, which are said to be astonishing. Animals include the saltwater crocodile and the musky rat-kangaroo.
The rainforest also holds many ancient plants which have survived from the southern supercontinent Gondwana.

Unter den Linden ("under the linden trees") is a boulevard in the Mitte district of Berlin, the capital of Germany. It is named for its linden (lime in British English) trees that line the grassed pedestrian mall in the middle of the road
Unter den Linden runs east–west from the site of the former Stadtschloss royal palace at the Lustgarten park, where the demolished Palast der Republik used to be, to Pariser Platz and Brandenburg Gate. Eastward the boulevard crosses the river Spree near the Dom (Berlin Cathedral) and continues as Karl-Liebknecht-Straße. The western continuation behind Brandenburg Gate is Straße des 17. Juni. Major north–south streets crossing Unter den Linden are Friedrichstraße and Wilhelmstrasse. 
Unter den Linden at the heart of the historic section of Berlin developed from a bridle path laid out by Elector John George of Brandenburg in the 16th century to reach his hunting grounds in the Tiergarten. It was replaced by a boulevard of linden trees planted in 1647, stretching from the city palace to the gates of the city, by order of the “Great Elector” Frederick William. While the western part of the boulevard retained its character, the area around present-day Bebelplatz was changed after the Thirty Years' War and fortified. There are no trees.
By the 19th century, as Berlin grew and expanded to the west, Unter den Linden became the best-known and grandest street in Berlin. In 1851 the famous equestrian (horse-riding) statue of King Frederick the Great, designed by Christian Daniel Rauch, was put up on the centre strip. In the course of the building of the Nord-Süd-Tunnel for the Berlin S-Bahn in 1934/35 most of the linden trees were cut down and during the last days of World War II the remaining trees were destroyed or cut down for firewood. The present-day linden were replanted in the 1950s, they are affected by air pollution as well as by soil contamination.
Since 1937, the numbering has started at the "Schlossbrücke" (Palace Bridge), connecting Unter den Linden with the Lustgarten and Museum Island. The disputed replica of the Alte Kommandantur is No. 1, vis-à-vis the Zeughaus arsenal, the oldest building on Unter den Linden, built between 1695 and 1706, today the seat of the "Deutsches Historisches Museum" (No. 2). Buildings along the street include (from east to west) the Kronprinzenpalais (former palace of the Hohenzollern crown princes, No. 3), the Neue Wache war memorial built in 1817 (No. 4), considered by many to be Karl Friedrich Schinkel’s masterpiece. Furthermore, on Bebelplatz the Berlin State Opera (No. 7), coloquially called "Lindenoper", St. Hedwig's Cathedral and the "Altes Palais" (No. 9), favoured residence of Emperor Wilhelm I; in the north the main building of the Humboldt University (No. 6) and House I of the Berlin State Library (No. 8). On the western end are the Russian Embassy (former Soviet Embassy, No. 63-65) the Hungarian Embassy (No. 76) at the corner of Wilhelmstrasse and finally the Hotel Adlon (No. 77) at the corner of Pariser Platz, which has been completely rebuilt on the site of the prewar hotel. Well-known statues of Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt in front of the university as well as of the Prussian generals Scharnhorst and Bülow also adorn the street.

Kathie Lee Gifford (born August 16, 1953) is an American talk show host, singer and actress. She is best known for hosting "Live with Regis and Kathie Lee" from 1985-2000 with Regis Philbin. She later co-hosted the fourth hour of NBC's "Today" show. She has received 11 Daytime Emmy nominations. She won her first Daytime Emmy in 2010 as part of the cast in "The Today Show".
Before she hosted talk shows, Gifford's first television appearance was Tom Kennedy's singer/sidekick on "Name That Tune", from 1974 to 1978. 
She has also appeared in television advertisements for Carnival Cruise Lines since 1984.
Early life.
Kathie Lee Gifford was born in Paris, France. Her birth name is Kathryn Lee Epstein. She is the daughter of Joan (née Cuttell; January 20, 1930 – September 12, 2017), a singer, and Aaron Epstein (March 19, 1924 – November 19, 2002), a musician and former U.S. Navy officer. Aaron Epstein was stationed with his family in France when Gifford was born. Gifford grew up in Bowie, Maryland, and attended Bowie High School. When she was in high school, Gifford was a singer in a folk group, "Pennsylvania Next Right," which performed frequently at school assemblies. As a senior in high school she dated and went to the prom with Michael Bray. After her graduation in high school, Gifford attended Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In Oral Roberts University she studied drama and music.
Gifford's paternal grandfather was of Russian Jewish descent and her paternal grandmother was of Native American ancestry. Her mother was a relative of Rudyard Kipling. She was of French Canadian, English and German descent and was raised in a snake handler family. After seeing the Billy Graham produced film, "The Restless Ones" at age 12, Gifford became a born-again Christian. She told Larry King, "I was raised with many Jewish traditions and raised to be very grateful for my Jewish heritage." Her brother, Rev. David Paul Epstein, is an evangelical Baptist preacher and pastor of Calvary Baptist Church in New York City.
The 1970s.
Gifford represented Maryland in America's Junior Miss Pageant in 1970.
During one summer in the early 1970s, she was a live-in secretary/babysitter for Anita Bryant at her home in Miami. Gifford's career took off in the 1970s (during her first marriage to Christian composer, arranger, producer and publisher Paul Johnson) as a vocalist on the game show "Name That Tune" with Tom Kennedy (she performed the "sing a tune" segment as Kathie Lee Johnson). In 1978, she joined the cast of the short-lived "Hee Haw" spinoff, "Hee Haw Honeys".
"Live with Regis and Kathie Lee".
After she was divorced from Johnson in 1983, Gifford met sports commentator Frank Gifford (born August 16, 1930) during an episode of ABC's "Good Morning America"; they both married in 1986. By that time she was several months into her most famous television role, as a full-time morning talk show personality. On June 24, 1985, she replaced Ann Abernathy as co-host of "The Morning Show" on WABC-TV with Regis Philbin. The program went into national broadcast in 1988 as "Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee", and Gifford became well-known across the country. In the 1990s, millions of morning-TV viewers watched her descriptions of life at home with her husband and their two children. She appeared as a spokesperson for Slim Fast diet shakes after her son, Cody, was born. She also was a celebrity of Carnival Cruises in the late 1980s and early 1990s, singing "If my friends could see me now!" Gifford left Live with Regis and Kathie Lee on 2000 after 15 years to focus on spending time with family and continue her singing career.
1996 sweatshop controversy.
In 1996 the National Labor Committee, a human rights group, reported that sweatshop labor was being used to make clothes for the Kathie Lee line, sold at Walmart. The group reported that a worker in Honduras smuggled a piece of clothing out of the factory, which had a Kathie Lee label on it. One of the workers, Wendy Diaz, came to the United States to testify about the conditions under which she worked. Diaz commented, "I wish I could talk to [Kathie Lee]. If she's good, she will help us."
Labor activist, Charles Kernaghan, spoke on media. He accused Gifford of being responsible for the sweatshop management activity. Gifford addressed Kernaghan's allegations on the air during "Live", explaining that she was not involved with hands-on project management in factories. 
Gifford later contacted Federal authorities to investigate the issue and worked with U.S. Federal legislative and executive branch agencies to support and enact laws to protect children against sweat shop conditions. She met with President Bill Clinton at the White House in order to support of the government's initiatives to counter international sweatshop abuses.
"Today".
On March 31, 2008, NBC announced that Gifford was to join its morning show, "Today", as co-host of the fourth hour, alongside Hoda Kotb. This marked her return to morning television; in many markets, she now airs directly after her old show, now called "Live! with Kelly and Michael". Because the fourth hour of "Today" airs live at 10:00am ET, and "Live! with Kelly and Michael" airs live at 9:00am ET, Gifford's hour does not compete directly with her former show in most markets. Kotb and Gifford replaced Ann Curry and Natalie Morales. 
She started hosting "Today" on April 7, 2008 with Hoda Kotb.

In 1692 the Duke of Hanover was made an Elector of the Holy Roman Emperor. After then the Dukes were usually called Electors of Hanover, .
Queen Anne of England and Great Britain had no children, Sophia-Dorothea was chosen as her protestant heir. When Anne died in 1714, Sophia Dorothea's son the Elector of Hanover became King George I of Great Britain. 

This article lists Dukes, Electors, and Kings ruling over territories named Saxony from the beginning of the Saxon Duchy in the 9th century to the end of the Saxon Kingdom in 1918.
Dukes of Saxony.
The original Duchy of Saxony was the lands of the Saxon people in the north-western part of present-day Germany, namely, the modern German state of Lower Saxony as well as Westphalia and Western Saxony-Anhalt, not the modern German state of Saxony.
Early dukes
Hattonid dynasty
Welf Dynasty.
When the Welfs left in 1180, the Duchy of Saxony lost a lot of territory. Westphalia fell to the Archbishop of Cologne, while the Duchies of Brunswick and Lüneburg remained with the Welfs. The Ascanian Dukes had their base further east, near the Elbe, so the name Saxony moved towards the east. The post carve-up Saxony is therefore sometimes called the "younger Duchy of Saxony". Also the counting of its dukes its mixed up. While the first post carve-up duke is sometimes called Bernard III - because of two predecessors of the same name before 1180 - or Bernard I with his great-great-great-great grandson Bernard II being counted second. The second post carve-up duke Albert I is already usually counted as the first, although before 1180 he had one predecessor of the same name, his grandfather Albert the Bear.
Ascanian or younger Duchy of Saxony.
The new dukes changed the Saxon horse emblem () and used their Ascanian family colours and emblem (black and gold stripes) () and added a "bendwise crancelin", a crown diagonally across the coat of arms, symbolising the Saxon ducal crown, as new coat-of-arms of Saxony (). The later rulers of the House of Wettin adopted the Ascanian coat-of-arms.
Dukes of Saxe-Lauenburg.
Since the Duke of Saxony was considered one of the prince-electors electing a new Holy Roman Emperor, there was an argument between the lines of Lauenburg and Wittenberg about who should cast Saxony's vote. In 1314 both lines found themselves on different sides in a double election. Eventually, the Dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg succeeded in 1356 after the promulgation of the Golden Bull. To distinguish him from other rulers bearing the title Duke of Saxony, he was commonly called "Elector of Saxony".
In 1303 the brothers split their inheritance between them, however, only two brothers had heirs creating the "Bergedorf-Mölln" and the "Ratzeburg-Lauenburg" lines.
Dukes of Saxe-Bergedorf-Mölln.
First named Saxe-Mölln, however, renamed after reorganising territory, including parts of Albert III's share in 1321.
In 1401, the elder branch became extinct and Lauenburg rejoined the Ratzeburg-Lauenburg line.
Dukes of Saxe-Ratzeburg-Lauenburg.
First named Saxe-Bergedorf-Lauenburg, however, renamed after reorganising territory, including parts of Albert III's share in 1321.
In 1401, the younger branch inherited Lauenburg and other possessions of the extinct elder Bergedorf-Mölln line.
Dukes of Saxe-Lauenburg (1401-1876).
The Ascanian Dynasty continued in Saxe-Lauenburg until 1689, but after the Lauenburg line had finally lost the Saxon Electorate to the Wittenberg line in 1356 and failed to obtain the succession in the Electorate after 1422, recognition of the Dukes of Saxe-Lauenburg as Dukes of Saxony waned.
Dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg.
For the predecessor see the section Ascanian or younger Duchy of Saxony above in this article.
Wettin Dukes of Saxony.
Albertine Dukes of Saxony.
The Albertines were a junior branch of the Wettin dynasty of Electors of Saxony (section below), who ruled in Northern Thuringia and Southern Meissen until they replaced the senior "Ernestine" branch as Electors and rulers of most Saxon territory in 1547.
Ernestine Dukes of Saxony.
Following their displacement by the Albertines, the Ernestine branch of the Wettins continued to rule in southern Thuringia as "Dukes of Saxony", but their lands eventually split up into many different tiny "Ernestine duchies". Of these, Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Saxe-Meiningen, and Saxe-Altenburg lasted until 1918. This article does not list the subsequent Ernestine dukes.
Electors of Saxony.
The Golden Bull of 1356 confirmed the right to participate in the election of a Holy Roman Emperor to the Duke of Saxony in the Saxe-Wittenberg line. For the predecessor see the section Ascanian Dukes of Saxe-Wittenberg above in this article.
Kings of Saxony.
The Holy Roman Empire came to an end in 1806. The Elector of Saxony, allied to Napoleon I, anticipated its dissolution by becoming the ruler of an independent Kingdom of Saxony in 1806.
Heads of the Albertine Branch of the House of Wettin (since 1918).
Saxony became a republic at the end of the German Empire in 1918. For later rulers, see List of Ministers-President of Saxony.

David Herman is an American actor, comedian and voice actor best known as an original cast member of "MADtv" and for his role as Michael Bolton in "Office Space". He is also known for his voice roles on television programs such as "Futurama", and "King of the Hill".
Biography.
David Herman was born in New York City and raised in Washington Heights. He graduated from the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts in 1987, then attended the acting program at SUNY Purchase. Herman appeared in the films "Born on the Fourth of July", "Lost Angels" and "Let It Be Me", but he is probably best known for his role as Michael Bolton in Mike Judge's "Office Space". Earlier, Herman had joined the cast of John Leguizamo's "House of Buggin in 1994; however, that show was short-lived. When FOX decided to mount a sketch comedy show to replace "House of Buggin, Herman was kept on as an original "MADtv" cast member.

The Ford Aerostar was the first minivan manufactured by Ford. The vehicle was introduced in 1985 as a 1986 model. The Aerostar was discontinued after 1997 and replaced by the Windstar, which was sold alongside since 1995. although Aerostar's role went unfilled until the 2010 introduction of the Ford Transit Connect van.

Strict weak ordering is a binary relation on a set. Such relations define a strict ordering, but they contain several elements of the same type. An example might be the relation "costs less than", or "is cheaper than". For any two elements that are "of different types", the relation holds. On the other hand, there are some elements that cannot be ordered that way, because they are of the same type. An example for such a relation may be the relation, "costs less than": milk may "cost less than" bread, and bread may cost less than cake. Two items of different types may cost less than another, but they can otherwise have the same price.
Two different algorithms that sort words by the number of letters in the word may not give the same ordering of the words with the same number of letters, but they will always give an ordering where the four-letter words come before the five-letter-words, and after the three-letter-words.
Time will give a strict weak ordering too; Events that are equivalent in the timeframe happen at the same time.

Compound eyes consist of many photoreceptor units or ommatidia. Each 'ommatidium' (singular) is an individual 'eye unit'. 
The image perceived is a combination of inputs from ommatidia on a convex surface. Thus they point in slightly different directions. 
Compared with simple eyes, compound eyes possess a wide-angle view. They can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the polarization of light. 
The general picture.
Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, and 96% of animal species possess a complex optical system. Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs, chordates and arthropods.
Almost all insects and arachnids use both simple and compound eyes.
Types of compound eye.
Compound eyes fall into two groups: apposition eyes, which form multiple inverted images, and superposition eyes, which form a single erect image. Compound eyes are common in arthropods, and are also present in annelids and some bivalved molluscs.
Compound eyes, in arthropods at least, grow at their margins by the addition of new ommatidia.
Good fliers.
Good fliers like flies or honey bees, or prey-catching insects like praying mantis or dragonflies, have specialized zones of ommatidia organized into a foveal area which gives acute vision. In the acute zone the eyes are flattened and the facets larger. The flattening allows more ommatidia to receive light from a spot and therefore higher resolution.
Other types.
Another version is the pseudofaceted eye, as seen in Scutigera. This type of eye consists of a cluster of numerous ocelli on each side of the head, organized in a way that resembles a true compound eye.
The body of "Ophiocoma wendtii", a type of brittle star, is covered with ommatidia, turning its whole skin into a compound eye. The same is true of many chitons.

Thundersnow, also known as a winter thunderstorm, a snow thunderstorm or a thundersnowstorm, is a thunderstorm with snow instead of rain. This rare kind of weather is less rare around the Midwestern United States, the Great Lakes and Rocky Mountains, the Sea of Japan, and Mount Everest. Thundersnow mostly happens in March.
How it is made.
Thunder can be heard many miles away, but thundersnow thunder can only be heard a few miles away. The snow stops sounds of thunder more than rain does.

Opsins are the universal photoreceptor molecules of all visual systems in the animal kingdom. 
They change from a resting state to a signalling state by absorbing light. This activates the G protein, resulting in a signalling cascade which produces physiological responses. 
This process of capturing a photon and transforming it into a physiological response is known as phototransduction.
Five groups of opsins are involved in vision. Another opsin found in the mammalian retina, melanopsin, is involved in circadian rhythms and pupillary reflex, but not in image-forming.
Each opsin allows vision in just a short stretch of wavelength. This is equivalent to seeing in only one color. Two opsins allow vision in two colors, and is usual in mammals. Four opsins allows vision in full color, and is usual in teleost fish, reptiles and birds. In mammals, only Old World monkeys, apes and humans have trichromacy, called full color vision. 
It is thought – see evolution of color vision – that mammals lost much of their color vision capability during the long period in the Mesozoic when they lived as mostly nocturnal animals.

Crash Bash (or Crash Bandicoot Carnival in Japan) is the fifth video game for the "Crash Bandicoot" series. In this game, a variety of mini-games are available for the player to play. The warp rooms were brought back here. 

Five Points (or The Five Points) was a slum (poor neighborhood) named after the five-cornered intersection of Anthony (now Worth St.), Cross (now Mosco), and Orange (now Baxter) in Manhattan it was located on. However, over time, the intersection sometimes had four or six corners. Five Points was the home to a lot of Irish and Italian immigrants, and to the 18th century Five Points Gang.

Magnoliids (or Magnoliidae or Magnolianae) are a group of flowering plants. They are descendants of the earliest flowering plants: they keep some features which look like those of conifers.
The group include magnolias, nutmeg, bay laurel, cinnamon, avocado, black pepper, tulip tree ("Lyriodendron") and many others. They have three-part flowers, pollen with one pore, and usually branching-veined leaves. 
The magnoliids are today more than 10,000 species of flowering plants. They are successful despite being "primitive" in structure.
The group has many food crops (such as avocados) and many with psychotropic effects. The famous Polynesian drink kava is prepared from a magnoliad, and nutmeg fruits are a source of the hallucinogen myristicin. Psychotropic effects are usually a defence against herbivory.

The Ford Thunderbird is an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company starting in 1955. The Thunderbird was also known as the T-Bird. The car was often used in NASCAR races.
John Denver recorded a song in 1986 called "Along for the Ride", about the 1956 Thunderbird. The words and music were by Danny O'Keefe and Bill Braun. The Beach Boys had a big hit with the song "Fun Fun Fun" which also was about the Thunderbird.

The International Species Information System (ISIS) is an international non-profit organization that helps zoos and aquariums around the world. ISIS gives its members software to collect and share information about animals. The ISIS database has information on 2.4 million animals of 10,000 species. ISIS members use basic information (age, sex, parents, place of birth, reports of deaths, etc.) collected in the ISIS system to care for and manage their animals.

The gums are the mucosal tissue that lies over the mandible and maxilla. They are also called gingiva. They surround the teeth and provide a seal around them. 
About of healthy gums.
Color.
Healthy gums are usually "coral pink." Other colors like red, white, and blue can mean there is a problem. Red gums mean that the patient has gingivitis, or the inflammation of the gum.
Shape.
Healthy gums fill and fit each space between teeth.
Texture.
Healthy gums are firm and do not move very much.
Reaction to disturbance.
Healthy gums usually have no reaction to normal disturbance such as brushing.

Manila Sound is a type of music that started in Manila, Philippines, from the last years of the 1960s to the middle of the 1970s. It is commonly known as the "bright side" of the time of President Ferdinand Marcos because of its cheerful words and was often used in protest to his dictatorship. 
This music type has affected all modern music types in the country as the beginner of Original Pilipino Music (OPM).
Music type.
Manila Sound was made famous by a folk rock band called Hotdog. Their songs: "Ikaw Ang Miss Universe Ng Buhay Ko" (or "You Are the Miss Universe Of My Life"), "'Manila'", and "Beh Buti Nga"; had catchy melody phrases common to the music type. Later, the singer-songwriter, Freddy Aguilar, used the music type with his music to express the suffering of the people. His song, "Bayan Ko", was popular in protests.
The music type is a mix of Filipino folk music and rock music added with some funk, light jazz, and disco, and is sung in both Tagalog and English languages.
The lyrics are childlike and often humorous caused by the disco fever in that period and in contrast to the oppression by Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos. It is sometimes described as "the marshmallow sound".

Common Sense is a pamphlet (short book) written by Thomas Paine. It was first published on January 10, 1776. Paine wrote the pamphlet to change the minds of people who wanted to peacefully settle their differences with the British government to fight for independence instead. 
The pamphlet said that the British government and other European monarchies were tyrannical, meaning they did not acknowledge the rights of people. Paine called the pamphlet "Common Sense" because he wrote that it was against common sense for an island to rule a larger nation. Therefore, the colonies should overthrow the British government.
The pamphlet was one of the bestselling works of the 18th century in America. Thomas Paine wrote in a style that was easy for most people to understand, instead of the hard to understand writing common in the Enlightenment Era. He also referenced the Bible and used idioms that many of the Protestant colonists understood.
The document was an important part of the American Revolutionary War. It lead to the Declaration of Independence, which the Second Continental Congress wrote and signed into law later that year. "Common Sense" helped by creating mass support.

The roofs are extended backwards over a shared passenger or cargo volume with access in the back (like in hatchbacks, minivans, SUVs, and passenger vans).
The first station wagons were built around 1910. Their frames were built out of wood. By the 1950s, the wood was replaced with fake wood.

Before a person is considered to be "venerable," he or she must be declared as such by a proclamation, approved by the Pope, of having lived a life that was "heroic in virtue" – the virtues being the Theological Virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the Cardinal Virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. The next step is beatification, at which point the person is referred to as "The Blessed", and finally canonization, at which point the person is referred to as "Saint". Two modern and well-known examples of those who have been declared venerable are Popes John Paul II and Pius XII, who were both declared venerable by Pope Benedict XVI in December 2009, and who are likely to be beatified soon.
The 7-8th-century English monk St. Bede was referred to as being "venerable" soon after his death and, by tradition, is therefore often referred to as "the Venerable Bede" despite his also having been canonized. St Bede was the first person to be recorded as "The Venerable".

A burrito is a traditional Mexican dish. It is based on a tortilla filled with foods such as meat, beans or cheese. In the United States, however, there are usually several ingredients. They use foods such as Mexican rice, beans, lettuce, salsa (such as pico de gallo), meat (such as carne asada), avocado, cheese, and sour cream.

The Lawrence Massacre (also known as Quantrill's Raid) was an attack on the town of Lawrence, Kansas on August 21, 1863. The attack was a battle in the U.S. Civil War. The Confederates won the battle. They won because groups of guerillas led by William Quantrill rode into town and shot every man they saw. They killed about 150 people.
The guerillas attacked Lawrence because the city supported abolition and because it was a center for the Jayhawkers. The Jayhawkers were free-state militia groups known for attacking plantations in the pro-slavery western counties of Missouri.
Background.
By 1863, there had been a lot of violence in Kansas. This is because people disagreed about whether Kansas should allow slavery or not.
In the summer of 1856, the first sacking of Lawrence started a guerrilla war in Kansas that lasted for years. John Brown might be the most famous person involved in the violence of the late 1850s that fought on the abolitionist or Jayhawker side. However, there were many groups on each side that fought during the "Bleeding Kansas" period.
By the beginning of the American Civil War, Lawrence was already a target for pro-slavery violence. This is because Lawrence was the biggest anti-slavery city in the state. It was also where the Union and Jayhawkers started attacks into Missouri. At first, the town and area around it were very prepared. They reacted strongly to any rumors that pro-slavery people might be coming to Lawrence. However, by the summer of 1863, this never happened, so the people did not fear much, and they forgot about their defenses.
Reasons for the attack.
Revenge for Jayhawker attacks.
Lawrence was a headquarters for a group of Jayhawkers (sometimes called "Red Legs"). They had started a campaign in late March 1863. They had a goal to end support from the people for the Confederate guerillas. Union General Blunt said the actions of the soldiers were as if "a reign of terror started, and no man's property was safe, nor was his life worth much if he fought them in their plans to rob and steal." Many Jayhawker leaders like Charles "Doc" Jennison, James Montgomery, and George Henry Hoyt attacked Western Missouri. This made both pro-southern and pro-Union civilians and politicians angry. The historian Albert Castel says that the bushwhackers under Quantrill also wanted to steal, but revenge was their main reason.
Survivors confirmed the feeling of revenge in the attack on Lawrence. Albert Castel wrote, "all the ladies and others who talked with the butchers of the 21st ult." said that "they were here to revenge the wrongs done their families by our men under Lane, Jennison, Anthony and Co." Charles L. Robinson, the first Governor of Kansas, was an eyewitness to the attack. He said the attack happened for revenge: "Before this raid the entire border counties of Missouri had experienced more terrible outrages (events) than ever the Quantrill raid at Lawrence... There was no burning of feet and torture by hanging in Lawrence as there was in Missouri, neither were women and children outraged." Robinson explained that Quantrill chose Lawrence because Jayhawkers had attacked Missouri "as soon as [started]," and Lawrence was the "headquarters for the thieves and their plunder."
Quantrill said that his reason for the attack was "to steal and destroy the town as revenge for Osceola." He was talking about the Union's attack on Osceola, Missouri in September 1861. Senator James H. Lane led it. His forces plundered Osceola, gave nine men a drumhead court-martial trial, and executed them.
Destruction of the Women's Prison in Kansas City.
The collapse of the Women's Prison in Kansas City is also often believed to have made some people want to join in on the attack. To try to stop the Missouri guerrillas from being in Kansas, General Thomas Ewing, Jr. issued "General Order No. 10" in April 1863. This ordered anyone helping or comforting the Confederate guerrillas to be arrested. This mostly meant women or girls who were relatives of the guerrillas. Ewing sent the arrested people to some makeshift prisons in Kansas City. The women were then kept in two buildings which were either too small or too dirty. Then they were moved to an empty building at 1425 Grand Boulevard. This building was part of the estate of Robert S. Thomas, George Caleb Bingham's father-in-law. In 1861, Bingham and his family were living in the building. However, in early 1862, he and his family moved to Jefferson City when he was chosen to be the treasurer of Missouri. Bingham had added a third level to the building to use as a studio.
At least ten women or girls, all under the age of 20, were prisoners in the building when it collapsed on August 13, 1863, killing four: Charity McCorkle Kerr, Susan Crawford Vandever, Armenia Crawford Selvey, and Josephine Anderson—the 15-year-old sister of William T. "Bloody Bill" Anderson. A few days later, Nannie Harris died from her wounds. The people who did not die from the collapse were Jenny Anderson (injured by the accident), Susan Anne Mundy Womacks, Martha "Mattie" Mundy, Lucinda "Lou" Mundy Gray, Elizabeth Harris (later married to Deal), and Mollie Grindstaff. Anderson's 13-year-old sister, who was stuck to a ball-and-chain inside the jail, got many injuries, including two broken legs.
Even before the jail fell, the arrest and planned deportation of the girls had made Quantrill's guerrillas angry; George Todd left a note for General Ewing threatening to burn Kansas City unless the girls were freed. Quantrill's raid on Lawrence was planned before the jail collapse, and even before General Ewing issued "General Order No. 10". However, the deaths of the guerrillas' female relatives made the raiders want to kill people even more during the attack.
Attack.
A man from Hesper named Henry Thompson tried to run to Lawrence to tell the people there that an attack was coming. He was able to run all the way to Eudora before he was too tired. An unknown man riding a chaise came across Thompson to ask if he needed help. Thompson told him that he ran all the way from Hester, and that he needed to warn Lawrence. Thompson and the man were able to get some people from Eudora to go to Lawrence to warn of an attack. They were too late.
Around 450 guerrillas came near Lawrence shortly after 5 a.m. One of the first deaths was a pastor, Samuel S. Snyder. He was outside milking his cows when the guerillas shot him. Their first goal was to get to the Eldridge House, a big brick hotel in the middle of Lawrence. They gained control of the building (which became Quantrill's headquarters during the raid). After that, Quantrill's men went into smaller groups that spread throughout Lawrence. For the next four hours, the raiders pillaged and burned 25% of the buildings in Lawrence. They burned all businesses except for two. They looted most of the banks and stores in town. They killed more than 150 people. All of the victims were men and boys. Some sources say 183 people were killed. An 1897 source says that among the dead were 18 of 23 untrained army recruits. By 9 a.m., the raiders were leaving Lawrence.
Mayor George W. Collamore hid in his family's well so that the guerillas would not find him. However, they set his house on fire, and he died from breathing in smoke. After the massacre, a friend of Collamore's named Lowe went into the well to find him. The rope he was holding onto broke, and he also died in the well. 
Several groups of guerillas came to judge Louis Carpenter's house. They took everything he owned, but he persuaded them to not kill him nor burn his house. Another group of guerillas came and asked him where he was from. He said he was from New York. One of the guerillas said, "It's you New York [people] that are doing all of the mischief". When the guerilla took out his revolver to shoot Carpenter, Carpenter ran back into his house. The guerillas chased him into his house, upstairs, and then back downstairs, shooting at him. Carpenter ran into the basement, but he was bleeding. They found him, and the guerillas chased him outside and shot him. His wife Mary used her body to protect him. A guerilla walked around her to find a place to shoot under her. He lifted her arm and aimed his revolver under it. He fired his gun so that she could see the bullet enter Carpenter's head. Then, the guerillas set the house on fire. His wife's sister was able to stop the fire however.
George Burt was standing near a fence when a guerilla came to him. The guerilla asked for all of his money. When Burt gave the guerilla his pocket book, the guerilla took it with one hand and shot Burt with the other.
A German man named Phillip Albach was sick, laying in bed. Guerillas demanded the family clear the house so they could burn it. The family carried Albach outside on a mattress and laid him in the yard. When the guerillas came out of the house, they killed him on his bed.
Reverend Hugh Dunn Fisher tried to run away from his home with his two sons. Fisher was sick, so he was unable to run. He went back into his house and hid under the stairs in his basement. When some guerillas came into the house, they demanded his wife Elizabeth let them look in the basement. They could not see Fisher in the darkness. When they left, they set the house on fire and watched it burn. They hoped that if Fisher was hiding inside, he would run outside so they could kill him. Elizabeth covered Fisher in an old dress and a carpet, and carried him out of the house. She covered him in the carpet and dress so that it would look like she was simply trying to save her belongings from the fire. Fisher hid under the carpet until the guerillas left, and all of the family lived.
The raiders wanted revenge, so they had a list of people they wanted to kill and buildings they wanted to burn. James H. Lane was at the top of the list. Lane was a military leader and a supporter of the Jayhawkers. Lane escaped by running through a cornfield while wearing his nightshirt. John Speer was one of Lane's biggest political supporters. Lane had put Speer into the newspaper business. Speer was also on the list. Charles L. Robinson, first governor of Kansas and an abolitionist, may also have been on the list. However, he was not killed. 
Many said that Quantrill's decision to kill young boys was a very bad part of the attack. Bobbie Martin is generally said to be the youngest person who died. Some stories of the raid say he may have been as young as ten to twelve years old, but others say he was fourteen years old. Most sources say he was wearing a Union soldier uniform or clothing made from his father's uniform, but others say he was holding a musket and cartridges. Most of Quantrill's guerrilla fighters were teenagers. One of the youngest was Riley Crawford. He was thirteen years old when his mother took him to Quantrill after Union soldiers shot her husband and burned her home.
The "Kansas State Journal" was the first newspaper in Lawrence to continue publishing after the attack. They released their first copy on October 1, 1863. In it, it said that every business in Lawrence had been sacked; every business except five had been burned; every house in Lawrence had been plundered; 160 men and boys had been killed. The Leavenworth "Daily Conservative," on August 23, 1863, said that the guerrillas caused $2,000,000 worth of damage, and stole $250,000 worth of money.
Aftermath.
The Lawrence massacre was one of the bloodiest events in the history of Kansas. The Plymouth Congregational Church in Lawrence wasn't destroyed, but many of its members were killed. Also, many of its records were destroyed.
A day after the attack, some of the people of Lawrence lynched Thomas Corlew, a member of Quantrill's raiders who was still in Lawrence. They believed he was a spy. They hanged him in a barn on Massachusetts Street.
After the attack, Quantrill brought his men south to Texas for the winter. By the next year, however, the raiders broke up as a group. They were unable to get similar successes. Quantrill died of wounds he got in Kentucky in 1865. By that point, he had only a few supporters left. Frank James and his younger brother, Jesse James were some of his supporters.
After Quantrill's attack, the Union built multiple military posts on Mount Oread. They built these to help guard the rebuilt city. However, no more attacks happened in Lawrence, and these forts were removed.

The Honda Odyssey is a minivan that has been made by Honda since 1994. From 1994 to 1999, it was also sold as the Isuzu Oasis. A larger version of the minivan has been available since 1999 in North America. It was redesigned in 2005, 2011, and 2018. The 2015 model was awarded the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's top rated pick because of its collision avoidance system.

Arctodus is an extinct genus of short-faced bear endemic to North America during the Pleistocene era about 2.5 million years ago to 12,800 years ago. There were two species, "Arctodus pristinus" and "Arctodus simus".
The giant short-faced bear, "Arctodus simus", evolved from "Arctodus pristinus" during the middle Pleistocene of North America, around 1.3 million years ago. Both species were omnivorous, feeding on tall vegetation and large mammals. "Arctodus simus" might have been the largest predatory land mammal that ever lived in North America.
Habitat.
Both species of "Arctodus" lived in different habitats, with "Arctodus pristinus" preferred dense forests in eastern North America, and "Arctodus simus" inhabiting open forests in western North America. However, after the extinction of "Arctodus pristinus", the giant short-faced bear spread east in small numbers.
"Arctodus pristinus" was particularly common on the east coast, with the largest concentrations being in Florida. Additional finds are from Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kansas and Aguascalientes (Mexico).
"Arctodus simus" lived in much of North America, ranging from Alaska to Puebla in the west, to Virginia and Florida in the east. This species is first found in California, and was most common in the savannas and of the western United States and Mexico, where many other megafauna lived.
Fossils.
The oldest "Arctodus" fossils are from the Kissimmee River &amp; Santa Fe River paleontological sites in Florida, belonging to "Arctodus pristinus." The first fossils of the "Arctodus simus" were found the Potter Creek Cave in Shasta County, California, by Edward Drinker Cope, with the oldest being from Irvington, California.
Paleontologists have found only one "Arctodus simus" skeleton in Indiana. It is famous because it was the biggest most-nearly complete skeleton of a giant short-faced bear ever found in America. The original bones are in Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History.
Males were much larger than females. When it was standing on its back legs, "Arctodus simus" was tall. A 2010 study estimated the weight of six "Arctodus simus" individuals, with a weight range between and . In comparison, "Arctodus pristinus" specimens have been calculated to an average of ~, although some northern and western "Arctodus pristinus" were the same size as small "Arctodus simus".
Behavior.
Both species were omnivores, browsing on shrubs and trees, and eating browsers like deer, camels, llamas, tapirs, ground sloths, and wood bison, Dental damage from eating carbohydrates, and seeds in "Arctodus simus"' poop proves plants were consumed, while bone damage on prey matches both "Arctodus" species' teeth. Analyses of "Arctodus simus"' bone chemicals confirm that the giant short-faced bear lived in open forests and other vegetated areas, and sometimes ate other open forest inhabitants.
Past research.
One theory was that the giant short-faced bear was an active predator, attacking herbivores directly. Another theory was that it let faster predators make the kill, then bullied them off the carcass, being a scavenger. Finally, anatomy led some to believe it was a herbivore. Modern research establishes all three behaviors were present in "Arctodus simus".
Previous theories also suggested that brown bears caused the extinction of "Arctodus simus", and that the giant short-faced bear prevented people from migrating into North America. However, these ideas have been rejected, with new dates confirming both co-existed with "Arctodus simus".
Extinction.
The replacement of hot &amp; humid forests with open habitats, along with competition with black bears and "Tremarctos floridanus", led to the extinction of "Arctodus pristinus" 300,000 years ago. "Arctodus simus" went extinct around 12,800 years ago, which was likely due to ecological collapse leading to fewer prey and quality vegetation.

Princess of Wales () is a royal title used in the United Kingdom. It is held by the wife of the Prince of Wales. It has been used since the first English Prince of Wales, in 1283.
The current Princess of Wales is Catherine, the wife of William, Prince of Wales.
There have been only ten Princesses of Wales, even though there have been a lot more than ten male heirs to the throne. The majority of Princes of Wales married after acceding to the throne as King. A number of other Princes of Wales died too young to marry.
Until 2022, the second wife of the past Prince of Wales, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, was the Princess of Wales, but did not use the title, out of respect for her husband's first wife, the late Diana, Princess of Wales.
The princess is usually entitled to the style of Her Highness.

Clerow "Flip" Wilson Jr. (8 December 1933 – 25 November 1998) was an African-American comedian whose career was successful in the 1960s and 1970s. He is perhaps best known for his television variety series The Flip Wilson Show, which earned him a Golden Globe and two Emmy Awards.
On November 25, 1998, Wilson died from liver cancer in Malibu, California, aged 64.

The Chevrolet Volt is an American plug-in hybrid car. The car was first produced in 2011 and is made by the Chevrolet division of General Motors. This vehicle travels 25 to 50 miles (38 miles average) on electric power alone. After the battery is depleted, it switches to the extended range mode.
In the United States, the car has a suggested price of $34,185, but qualifies for a $7500 tax credit. It can carry up to four people (including the driver). A second generation arrived in 2015. It stopped in 2019. The first generation Volt was produced 2011-2016, while the second 2016-2019.
Design.
The Volt has 16.5 kWh of lithium batteries and a 1.4 liter engine using premium fuel. The batteries have enough power to drive the car normally (it can go from 0 to 60 mph in 9 seconds). While the batteries have power, the car is like an electric car.
When the batteries run out of charge, they can be recharged from a special electrical outlet, or the car can turn on the gas engine. The gas engine and electric motors combine in a special type of transmission called a planetary gear, like the Toyota Prius. This allows the gas engine to drive the car or to change its power to electricity. The electricity can charge the battery or power the electric motor.
Fuel efficiency.
How much gas is used depends on how the car is driven and when the batteries are recharged. It is possible to only use electric power and never use gasoline. The EPA estimates the average person will get 98 miles per gallon (including the equivalent cost of electricity).
Recharging.
The batteries can be recharged in 10 to 16 hours using a 120V charging unit (most circuits in a house are at 120V). A 240V charging unit will recharge the car batteries in four hours. The batteries can also be charged from the gas engine or from the "regenerative" brakes, which turn the energy of the moving car into electricity.

The Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom is the official coat of arms of the British monarch, currently Charles III. These arms are used by the King in his official capacity as monarch of the United Kingdom, and are officially known as his Arms of Dominion. Different versions are used by other members of the Royal Family; and by the British Government in connection with the administration and government of the country. In Scotland, the King has a separate version of the Royal Arms, a variant of which is used by the Scotland Office.
The shield is quartered, depicting in the first and fourth quarters the three passant guardant lions of England; in the second, the rampant lion and double tressure fleury-counter-fleury of Scotland; and in the third, a harp for Ireland.
The version used by the government does not have the helmet or lion, the version used by the government in Scotland does not have the lion or "In Defens" motto.

Yaws is a tropical infection of the skin, bones and joints. It is caused by the spirochaete bacterium "Treponema pallidum pertenue".
The disease begins with a round, hard swelling of the skin, two to five centimeters in diameter. The center may break open and form an ulcer. This usually heals after three to six months. After several weeks, or even years later, the joints and bones may become painful, fatigue may develop, and new skin sores may appear. The skin of the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet may become thick and break open. The bones (especially those of the nose) may change shape. After five years or more large areas of skin can die. This leaves large scars.
Yaws is spread by touching the fluid from the sores of a person with the disease. The disease is most common among children, who spread it by playing together.
Other similar diseases are caused by different strains of the same bacterium, such as syphilis ("Treponema pallidum pallidum"). Once the lesions have appeared doctors are able to tell it is yaws. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the best method of diagnosis.
The main way of stopping the disease spreading, is by curing those who have it. This stops them passing it on to others. Where the disease is common, treating the entire community is effective. Improving cleanliness and sanitation will also decrease spread. Yaws can be treated with antibiotics. Without treatment, physical deformities happen in 10% of cases.
Yaws is common in at least 14 tropical countries as of 2012. The disease infects only humans. In the 1950s and 1960s the World Health Organization (WHO) nearly destroyed yaws. Since then the number of cases has increased.
One of the first descriptions of the disease was made in 1679 by Willem Piso. Archaeology shows that yaws may have been present among humans as far back as 1.6 million years ago.

Pele was the goddess of fire, dancing, and volcanoes in Hawaiian religion. Pele's husband is Wahielo, also spelled with an "a".
There are several stories about who Pele is. One story says that her sister is the goddess of the ocean. In another story, she lives in a land in the sky.

The Chevrolet Impala was a full size car made from the Chevrolet network of General Motors. The name "Impala" comes from the southern African antelope. The car was first produced in 1957, discontinued around 1985 and then resumed for the 1994 model year. From 2000 to 2005, the Impala was a mid-sized sedan and succeeded Chevrolet's dwindling Lumina. The 2006 to present Impala is a full-sized sedan and is sold to the public, the previous generation is restricted to fleet and commercial buyers and is dubbed Impala Ltd. The Impala limited is set to conclude production in 2016. Its final generation, introduced in 2012, went on sale in May 2014 until General Motors discontinued the vehicle in March 2020.

The Coral Sea is a small sea off the north east coast of Australia. It has Queensland on its west side and the islands of Vanuatu and New Caledonia on its east. On the north edge is the Solomon Islands, and in the south it joins the Tasman Sea. The Great Barrier Reef is in the Coral Sea. It has a warm climate, it often rains and there are often tropical cyclones. It covers an area of about four times the size of Great Britain. The WWF describe the Coral Sea as being one of the last complete tropical wilderness areas on earth. It has beautiful coral reefs with many different sea creatures including grey and white tip reef sharks, hammerheads, manta rays, tuna, barracuda, turtles, whales and the rare nautilus.
Australia claims many of the islands as part of its 780,000 square kilometre Coral Sea Islands Territory. Most of them are small coral or sand islands, and only one has few people living on it. It has a population of only four.
World War II.
In World War II the Battle of the Coral Sea was the first aircraft carrier battle fought between the United States and Australia against Japan. The battle lasted from 4 May to 8 May 1942. During that time none of the ships saw each other or fired their guns at each other. All the fighting was done by aircraft from the carriers. It is the largest naval battle fought near Australia. It was important because it stopped the Japanese from invading Port Moresby, the capital city of New Guinea. Many people regarded it as the battle that saved Australia.

Systematics is one of the main fields in biology. It is closely related to taxonomy.
Systematics is the study of the diversification of life on the planet Earth, both past and present, and the relationships among living things through time. 
Relationships are usually seen as evolutionary trees (cladograms, phylogenetic trees, phylogenies). 
Phylogenies have two components, "branching order" (showing group relationships) and "branch length" (showing amount of evolution). Phylogenetic trees of species and higher taxa are used to study the evolution of traits (anatomical or molecular characteristics), and the distribution of organisms (biogeography). Systematics is used to help us understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth.
"Systematic biology" and "taxonomy" are terms that are often confused and used interchangeably. They were defined as follows:
Systematics is the field which (a) provides scientific names for organisms, (b) describes them, (c) preserves collections of them, (d) provides classifications for the organisms, keys for their identification, and data on their distributions, (e) investigates their evolutionary histories, and (f) considers their environmental adaptations. Taxonomy is that part of systematics concerned with topics (a) to (d) above.

The tiger salamander is a species of mole salamander. Another name for this salamander is the eastern tiger salamander.
Description.
Eastern tiger salamanders are big, with a normal length of 6–8 inches (15–20 cm). They can grow up to 14 inches (36 cm) in length. Grown-ups are usually spotted with grey, green, or black, and have large eyes. They have short mouths, big necks, strong legs, and long tails. They eat small insects and worms. Sometimes, grown ups eat small frogs and baby mice
Adults are almost never seen in open fields and often live in holes that are usually 2 feet from the top. Tiger salamanders almost always stay on land as adults, and usually only return to the water to lay eggs. But they also live in both land and water. Tiger salamanders like to swim, even if they enjoy living on land more. They are good swimmers. Like all ambystomatids, they are extremely loyal to their birthplace, and will travel long distances to go back. However, a single tiger salamander has only a 50% chance of laying eggs more than once in its lifetime. Males bump a female to initiate mating, and then deposit a spermatophore on the lake bottom. The female picks up the packet and deposits the now-fertilized eggs on vegetation. Large-scale captive breeding of Tiger salamanders has not been accomplished, for unknown reasons.
The larvae are entirely aquatic, with large gills on the outside and a big tail fin that begins just behind the head. Arms are grown within a short time of coming out of their egg. Some larvae metamorphose quickly. These are known as 'small morph adults'. Other larvae, especially in ancestral pools and warmer climates, may not metamorphose until fully adult size. These large larvae are usually known as waterdogs, and are used many times in the fishing bait and pet trade. Some populations may not metamorphose at all, and become sexually mature while in their larval form. These are the neotenes, and are particularly common where terrestrial conditions are bad.

While remaining common in many places, tiger salamander numbers have gone down compared with old levels. One of the threats to them is wetland (habitat) destruction. Since they tend to breed in semipermanent wetlands, baby tiger salamanders often experience mass deaths in association with pond drying. 
Related species.
The California tiger salamander ("Ambystoma californiense"), the barred tiger salamander ("Ambystoma mavortium"), and the plateau tiger salamander ("Ambystoma velasci"), were all once subspecies of "A. tigrinum", but are now separate species. Genetic studies made it right to break up the first "A. tigrinum" population, even though there is some hybridization between the groups.
The Axolotl is also a relative of the tiger salamander.

Korea under Japanese rule is a term to define Korea when it was under Japanese control. Japanese victory in the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895 and in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 cleared the way. Japan controlled Korea for 35 years during Japanese Imperialism. The Japanese control of Korea lasted from 22 August 1910 until 15 August 1945. The Japanese rulers of Korea left the country on 2 September 1945. In Japan, the more common term is "Korea of the Japanese-Governed Period" (���������, Nippon Tōchi-jidai no Chosen).
The period is usually divided into three parts. In 1910-1919, the Japanese treated Koreans very badly. From 1919 to 1930-s they created better policies to deal with the Korean people. However, they later tried to force them to become Japanese.
Despite them being allies to the United States and having an interest in each other's cultures, Japanese and Koreans still tend to have suspicion of each other because of how Japan treated Korea during its time as a colony

The Premier of Queensland is the head of the Government of Queensland, Australia. The Premier does the same job at a state level as the Prime Minister of Australia does at a national level. Formal power is held by the Queen who is represented in Queensland by the Governor of Queensland. The Governor acts on the advice given to him by the Premier. The current Premier of Queensland is Annastacia Palaszczuk.
Queensland is governed under the Westminster system of parliamentary government. Unlike other Australian states, it is not a bicameral system, having only one elected house. This house is called the Legislative Assembly. After an election, the State Governor appoints as Premier, the leader of the party who can control a majority of the elected members in the lower house. The Premier must resign if they no longer have a majority in the Legislative Assembly. This can happen if they lose seats at an election, or if their own political party does not support them.
Queensland was a British colony, and power was held by the Governor. In 1859 Britain allowed Queensland to have its own parliament, and the power was passed to the Premier.

Lightning Bar was an American Quarter Horse racehorse and breeding stallion. He was owned by Art Pollard. Lightning Bar's father was a Thoroughbred, and his mother was originally from Louisiana. Louisiana was known for breeding racehorses that ran short distances. Although he only raced for one year, he still managed to achieve an AAA speed index. His racing career was cut short by illnesses. After racing, he became a show horse and a roping horse. As a breeding stallion, he only fathered eight crops of foals, but fathered a number of important horses. His most famous son was Doc Bar. Lightning Bar died in 1960 from disease, at the age of 9. Lightning Bar was inducted into the American Quarter Horse Association's (AQHA's) American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2008.
Early life.
Born in 1951, Lightning Bar was bred to be a racehorse. Injuries and illnesses kept him from racing past the age of two. He was bred by Art Pollard, who owned him his entire life. He was fathered by Three Bars, a Thoroughbred stallion later inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame. Lightning Bar's mother was Della P, a daughter of the Thoroughbred stallion Doc Horn. His maternal grandmother, was a mare who was never given a name and was sired by Old D. J. Art Pollard bought Della P from "Dink" Parker for $1,750 ($ as of ) in the late 1940s. Della P was bred in Louisiana, which was a leading state breeding short distance racehorses during the years 1900–1940. Della P was brought to Arizona by Parker. 
When Lightning Bar was about 5 days old, Pollard was afraid that he had leg problems and was buck-kneed. Pollard thought about putting the young horse to sleep. First, though, he asked the advice of Parker. Pollard later said about the story, "Dink just looked at me and shook his head. 'Ain't you ever gonna learn nothing? That colt's just what you're looking for.' " When mature, Lightning Bar stood 15.2 hands (or ) tall and weighed about . He was a sorrel-colored horse.
Racing and show career.
Lightning Bar started ten times on the racetrack. He won four times, came in second three times, and came in third once. Among those finishes, he ran second and third in two stakes races. His total earnings on the track were $1,491 ($ as of ). His highest speed index, or comparative rating of his speed, was AAA. He only raced for one year, as he suffered from pneumonia, distemper, and injured legs. He did equal one track record for two-year-olds at Pomona Racetrack, running in 17.2 seconds. 
After Lightning Bar's racing career, he went on to be a show horse. He earned 18 open halter points with the AQHA. He earned an AQHA Champion award in 1955. He won one grand championship and one reserve championship in halter classes at recognized AQHA shows.
Breeding career.
The first year Lightning Bar stood as a breeding stallion, his stud fee, or the fee charged to breed a mare to him, was $250 ($ as of ). Only nine mares were bred to him. The next year, he only bred 11 mares. In 1956, he bred 102 mares at $500 ($ as of ) each. One of Pollard's attempts to advertise his stallion involved letting one of his ranch hands take the stallion to a local jackpot roping. Pollard assumed that the employee would just ride Lightning Bar around and show him off. Pollard later discovered that more was involved. Pollard said later that "I should have been suspicious when he (the ranch hand) returned with Lightning Bar that afternoon, with a sheepish grin on his face. I asked him how the horse was received and he said 'The stud did good and I won the jackpot!' After congratulating him, I asked which rope horse he had used. He replied, 'The stud.' "
Pollard said of Lightning Bar that "I always had to be careful about the kind of latch I used on a gate with that horse. He could figure them out faster than I could. He would open a gate, and go for a stroll." Lightning Bar sired 148 foals in his eight breeding seasons. 118 of those foals went on to either race or show careers. 108 of his foals started races, and 77 of them won races, with a total of $476,949 total earnings. Lightning Belle was the foal who earned the most on the racetrack, earning $60,134 ($ as of ).
Five of Lightning Bar's foals earned AQHA Championships: Cactus Comet, Crash Bang, Lightning Rey, Pana Bar and Relampago Bar. One earned a Supreme Championship, Lightning Rey. His offspring earned $1,163.32 in National Cutting Horse Association competition. Another four earned a Superior Halter Horse title.
Death and legacy.
Lightning Bar died in June 1960 from Colitis-X, a virus of unknown origin that can kill quickly without warning. The virus infected a large number of Pollard's horses. Only three horses that caught the disease survived. Pollard was so heart-broken, he sold off his remaining stock and did not return to the Quarter Horse business for 15 years. Pollard later said about the loss of his horses that "it was a nightmare when they were wiped out. Even now, we can still feel the sadness of losing those horses." Another time, Pollard said that "Someone once said that a man deserves one good woman and one good dog in his lifetime. To that quip I would add one good horse. I certainly had one in Lightning Bar."

In quantum mechanics, the Wave function, usually represented by "�", or "�", describes the probability of finding an electron somewhere in its matter wave. To be more precise, the "square" of the wave function gives the probability of finding the location of the electron in the given area, since the normal answer for the wave function is usually a complex number. The wave function concept was first introduced in the Schrödinger equation. 
Mathematical interpretation.
The formula for finding the wave function (i.e., the probability wave), is below:
formula_1
where "i" is the imaginary number, "� (x,t)" is the wave function, "ħ" is the reduced Planck constant, "t" is time, "x" is position in space, "Ĥ" is a mathematical object known as the "Hamiltonian operator". The reader will note that the symbol formula_2 denotes that the partial derivative of the wave function is being taken.
Probabilistic nature.
Note that the wave in question, commonly referred to as Schrodinger's Wave, "is not in physical space", and does not give the probability of where an object is -- the object has no physical existence. The wave function gives "the probability that if you look, you will "observe" (emphasis mine) the object at a particular place". When nothing disturbs it, an electron does not exist in any place. "Quantum mechanics brings probability to the heart of the evolution of things."

In string theory and theoretical physics, strings are hypothetical objects that are believed to be the elementary particles of the universe. If they exist, they would not be point-like particles, but rather 1-dimensional "strings" of energy that vibrate in various dimensions. The image to the right illustrates the various possible dimensions that a string could vibrate in. (Currently, physicists accept the fact that there are at least 11 dimensions in our universe: 1 time dimension and 10 spatial dimensions.) The length of the strings would be determined by Planck length:
It is still not known whether these strings actually exist. They are pretty much the main topic of string theory.

National Party of South Africa was an Afrikaner dominated white South African nationalist political party that controlled the South African government from 1948 to 1994. It was founded in 1914 by J.B.M. Hertzog as a result of disagreements between him and the leaders of the South African Party, which he then was a member of. In 1948 its leader Daniel Francois Malan became Prime Minister of South Africa, and the party began instituting apartheid in South Africa. However, apartheid was only one among a variety of issues that helped bring the National Party to power. Most people who voted for the National Party in 1948 were voting more against the previous United Party led by Jan Smuts than for Malan's National Party. This was because of Smuts's support of the United Kingdom in the Second World War, and other issues that irritated Afrikaner voters such as the poverty of Afrikaners, the competition from native Africans for jobs, the urbanization of Afrikaner towns, and the threat of communism, which the Afrikaner voters generally felt Smuts had wrongly handled and felt that the problems were partially his fault. South African President FW de Klerk, the last South African government leader to belong to the party, disbanded apartheid in the 1990s and allowed all adults of all races to vote for the first time in 1994, which resulted in the National Party being voted out of office.

Príncipe is the northern and smaller of the two major islands of the country of São Tomé and Príncipe. It is in the sea to the west of Africa. It has an area of . Close to 5,000 people live there. The island is a heavily eroded volcano over three million years old. It is surrounded by other smaller islands including Ilheu Bom Bom, Ilhéu Caroço, Tinhosa Grande and Tinhosa Pequena. Príncipe rises in the south to at Pico de Príncipe, in a part of the Obo National Park that is covered with trees. The north and centre of the island were formerly plantations, most of them formed by Portuguese colonialists using slave labor. These concentrated initially on producing sugar and later on cocoa, becoming the world's greatest cocoa producer. Since independence these plantations have since largely gone back to being forest. 
Príncipe was the site where Einstein's Theory of Relativity was experimentally proved successful by Arthur Stanley Eddington and his team during the total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919.

The "Truman Show" delusion is a delusion some people have. It is named after "The Truman Show", a movie from 1998. In the movie, the main character discovers that he is living in a constructed reality that is shown on television. All people except the main character of the movie are paid actors. People with this disorder have delusions about being followed. The may also think that they are famous. As of 2012, there were over forty reported cases of this delusion, in the U.S and the United Kingdom. 
One of the patients, an upper-middle class Army veteran who wanted to climb the Statue of Liberty in the belief that doing so would release him from the "show", described his condition this way:
I realized that I was and am the center, the focus of attention by millions and millions of people ... My family and everyone I knew were and are actors in a script, a charade whose entire purpose is to make me the focus of the world's attention.
The choice of the name "Truman Show Delusion" by the Golds was influenced by the fact that three of the five patients Joel Gold initially treated for the syndrome explicitly linked their perceived experiences to the film.
Truman Syndrome.
In the U.K., psychiatrists Paolo Fusar-Poli, Oliver Howes, Lucia Valmaggia and Philip McGuire of the Institute of Psychiatry in London described in the "British Journal of Psychiatry" what they referred to as the "Truman Syndrome":
[A] preoccupying belief that the world had changed in some way that other people were aware of, which he interpreted as indicating he was the subject of a film and living in a film set (a ‘fabricated world’). This cluster of symptoms ... is a common presenting complaint in individuals ... who may be in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia.
The authors suggest that the "Truman explanation" is a result of the patients' search for meaning in their perception that the ordinary world has changed in some significant but inexplicable way.

Giant tortoises have evolved on a number of tropical islands. They can weigh as much as 3 or 400 kg (660880 lbs) and can grow to be 1.3 to 1.9 m (45.9 ft) long (accounts vary). They live, or lived (some species are recently extinct), in the Seychelles, the Mascarenes and the Galapagos. Today, the world's largest population lives on Aldabra Atoll in Seychelles, where there are about 150,000 individuals. Although looking similar, the tortoises represent separate branches of evolution. The Seychelles and Mascarenes tortoises came originally from nearby Madagascar, while the Galapagos tortoises came from nearby Ecuador. Their similarity is an example of convergent evolution.
These tortoises are capable of living over 100 years in the wild. This makes them the longest-living vertebrates. The longest living survivor is 182 years old (probably).
The Madagascar tortoise "Tu'i Malila" was 188 at death in Tonga in 1965. "Harriet" was reported by the Australia Zoo to be 176 years old when she died in 2006. Also, on 23 March 2006, an Aldabra giant tortoise named "Adwaita" died at Alipore Zoological Gardens in Kolkata. He was brought to the zoo in the 1870s from the estate of Lord Robert Clive. He was around 255 years old when he died.
Around the time of its discovery, they were caught and killed for food in such large quantities that they became virtually extinct by 1900. Giant tortoises are now under strict conservation laws and are categorised as threatened species.
During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Galápagos were frequented by buccaneers preying on Spanish treasure ships. Filling a ship's hold with tortoises was an easy way to stock up on food, a tradition that was continued by whalers in the centuries that followed. "whaling skippers were almost lyrical in their praise of tortoise meat, terming it far more delicious than chicken, pork or beef". They said the meat of the giant tortoise was "succulent meat and the oil from their bodies as pure as butter, but best of all, the giants could hibernate in a ship’s damp for a year or more".
At least five species of the genus "Cylindraspis" have gone extinct in historic times. They lived in the Mascarene Islands (Mauritius, Rodrigues and Réunion) in the Indian Ocean.
Galapagos tortoise.
The Galápagos tortoise or Galápagos giant tortoise ("Chelonoidis nigra") is the biggest living species of tortoise and the 10th-heaviest living reptile.
The tortoise lives in seven of the Galápagos Islands. The island is a volcanic archipelago about 1,000 km (620 mi) west of the Ecuadorian mainland. Spanish explorers, who discovered the islands in the 16th century, named them after the Spanish "galápago", meaning tortoise.
Their shell size and shape are different between populations. On islands with humid highlands, the tortoises are larger, with domed shells and short necks. On islands with dry lowlands, the tortoises are smaller, with "saddleback" shells and long necks. Charles Darwin's observations of these differences on the second voyage of the Beagle in 1835, helped him to develop his theory of evolution.
The population of the Galápagos tortoise is getting smaller. There were over 250,000 individuals in the 16th century. In the 1970s, that number got smaller to around 3,000. The decline is believed to be caused by over-exploitation, habitat loss and introduced species to the islands such as rats, goats and pigs. Ten subspecies of the original fifteen survive in the wild. An eleventh subspecies ("C. n. abingdoni") had only a single known living individual. It was kept in captivity. "Lonesome George" died in June 2012.
There have been many conservation efforts. Because of this, thousands of captive-bred juveniles were released onto their home islands. As a result, the population grew to 19,000 at the start of the 21st century. However, the species is still classified as "vulnerable" by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
Aldabra giant tortoise.
The main population of the Aldabra giant tortoise lives on the islands of the Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles. The atoll has been protected from human influence and is home to some 100,000 giant tortoises, the world's largest population of the animal. Another isolated population of the species lives on the island of Changuu, near Zanzibar and other captive populations are in conservation parks in Mauritius and Rodrigues. The tortoises exploit many different kinds of habitat, including grasslands, low scrub, mangrove swamps, and coastal dunes.
The species is called "Aldabrachelys gigantea" or "Dipsochelys dussumieri". The names refer to the same tortoise.

Amphiuma is a genus of aquatic salamanders. They are the only genus still living in the family Amphiumidae. They are sometimes called "conger eels" or "congo snakes", which is not correct. Amphiumas have one of the largest amounts of DNA in the living world, around 25 times more than a human.
Description.
Amphiumas have a long body. They are generally grey-black in color. They do have legs but they are very small. Amphiumas can be up to long, their legs are only up to about . It is because of this that they are often mistaken for eels or snakes. They also do not have eyelids or a tongue. 
Female amphiumas lay their eggs in wet mud. They then stay coiled around them for about five months, until they hatch. The larvae have external gills. After about four months these external gills disappear and the lungs begin to work. 
Distribution.
Amphiumas live in the southeastern part of the United States. 
In the past they have lived in more areas. Fossils from the Pleistocene time show that they once lived in Europe.
Behavior.
During the day amphiumas hide in plants. At night they become active and go hunting. Their prey include frogs, snakes, fish, crustaceans, insects and even other amphiumas. Hunting and eating habits are similar to that of the Axolotl. They suck food into their stomachs with vacuum force. They can become aggressive. 
Species.
There are three amphiuma species. They are different because of the number of toes:

Megophryidae are a large family of frogs. They live in the warm southeast of Asia, from the Himalaya foothills eastwards, south to Indonesia and the Greater Sunda Islands in Maritime Southeast Asia, and going to the Philippines. There are 70-100 species of frog divided between 12 genera. They are commonly called megophryids.
The megophryids are known for their camouflage, especially those that live in forests. They often look like dead leaves. They even have some skin folds that look like leaf veins.
Megophryids range in size from to in length. The adults' tongue is noticeably paddle-shaped. Their tadpoles can be found in a variety of waters, but especially ponds and streams. The tadpoles are very diverse in form because of the variety of habitats they live in.

Spadefoot is the name of the following toads:

Notaden is a genus of frogs. They live in central and northern Australia. They are a digging frog.
Description.
Its body is very round in shape with a short neck. Its pupils are horizontal slits. It has long arms and short, stubby legs. Its fingers do not have webbing and its toes may have little to no webbing. The skin is slightly warty. Because it looks like some species of toads it is often incorrectly called a toad. It lets out a poisonous sticky fluid from its skin when picked up. It lays eggs in chains like some toad species.

The Tukeit Hill Frog ("Allophryne ruthveni") is one of the two described species in the genus "Allophryne". The other one is "Allophryne resplendens". It is the only member of the subfamily Allophryninae, a clade recently placed under the family Centrolenidae These frogs live in Guyana, Venezuela, Surinam, Brazil and Bolivia. The holotype was discovered at Tukeit Hill, below Kaieteur Falls, Guyana. This is the reason for the common English name.
Description.
The Tukeit Hill Frog is a small frog. It can have different colors. They are either black, with stripes and spots which can be golden or dull yellow, or a dull yellow or golden stomach surface, with black strips and spots. It has a flat body, and small flat head. The toe pads are large, wider than the fingers.
Behaviour.
The Tukeit Hill Frog spends some time low in the trees, 1–3 metres, and some of the time on the ground. This frog lives in sparse forest, avoiding cleared land.

The Arthroleptidae is a family of frogs found in sub-Saharan Africa. They are known as squeakers because of their high-pitched call. They are small, less than in length. They live on land mostly in leaf litter on the forest floor. They do not have tadpoles. They lay their eggs on the ground. 
Some species hatch already completely metamorphosed into the adult form, others still have tails when they hatch.
Taxonomy.
Arthroleptidae is separated into two sub-families: Arthroleptinae and Leptopelinae. Some think these are separate families. 
The two sub-families have these genera:

Rhonda Fleming (August 10, 1923 – October 14, 2020) was an American television and movie actress. She starred in many television programs and lots of movies in the 1940s and 1950s. She was known as one of the most beautiful actors of her time. Fleming was born in Hollywood, California.

 is a former Japanese government entity starting in 1869 and ending in 1943
In 1943, the prefecture's municipalities, including the traditional city of Tokyo, became part of the newly formed or "greater Tokyo metropolian area".

Alexandre Nikolayevich Benois (3 May 18709 February 1960) was an artist, art critic, and historian. He was born in St. Petersburg and died in Paris. He designed several productions for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes including "Petrushka".

The glass frog (or glassfrog) is the common name for the frogs of the amphibian family Centrolenidae. Most glass frogs are a lime green color. For some glass frogs the skin on the stomach area is transparent. The insides, including the heart, liver, and gastrointestinal tract can be seen through the skin. This is the reason for the common name.
Characteristics.
Glass frogs are generally small, ranging from in length. The frog is known to eat its own young. They are green in color over most of their bodies. The skin along the lower surface of the body is translucent.
Glass frogs are similar in appearance to some green frogs of the genus "Eleutherodactylus" and to some tree frogs of the family Hylidae. Hylid tree frogs have eyes that face to the side, whilst those of glass frogs face forward.
Distribution.
These frogs live from southern Mexico to Panama. They are through the Andes from Venezuela and the island of Tobago to Bolivia. Some species are in the Amazon and Orinoco River basins, the Guiana Shield region, southeastern Brazil, and northern Argentina.
Biology.
Glass frogs are mostly arboreal. They live along rivers and streams during the breeding season. Many live in montane cloud forests of Central and South America. Some species also live in Amazon and Chocóan rainforest and semi-deciduous forests.
The eggs are usually put on the leaves of trees or shrubs. The leaves hang over the running water of mountain streams, creeks, and small rivers. One species leaves its eggs over stones close to waterfalls. After they hatch, the tadpoles fall into the waters below. The tadpoles are long, with powerful tails and low fins, suited for fast flowing water. Outside of the breeding season some species live in the canopy.
Genera.
Family CENTROLENIDAE
Incertae sedis "Ikakogi" 

Craugastoridae is a family of frogs. There are 2 genera: "Craugastor" and "Haddadus". 
The genus "Craugastor" has 112 species. They can be found in the southwestern United States, Mexico, Central America up to northwestern South America. The genus "Haddadus" has 2 species. They are only found in south-eastern Brazil. 

Eleutherodactylidae is a family of frogs. They used to be a subfamily of Leptodactylidae. There are 801 frogs in the family. 

Hemiphractidae is a family of frogs. They live in South and Central America. Previously, this group was classified as a subfamily under family Hylidae. 
Breeding behavior.
This frog is different in that the eggs grow into froglets on the back of the female. In most there is no free-swimming tadpole stage. In some of the frogs the eggs are in a pouch until they hatch.
Taxonomy.
The Hemiphractidae family is divided into the following genera:

The shovelnose frogs are nine species of frog in the genus, Hemisus. The is the only genus in the Family Hemisotidae. They are found in tropical and subtropical sub-Saharan Africa. 
The shovelnose frogs are medium sized frogs, reaching a length of . They are round-bodied, with short legs. Their head is small and narrow, with a hard, upturned nose. 
The shovelnose frogs are digging frogs. They live most of their life underground. The female will dig underground while it is in amplexus. It then will lay the eggs in an underground hole. The male will leave through the tunnel, and the female will stay with the eggs. Once enough rain has fallen, the female will dig, with her nose, towards a water source. The tadpoles will stay there until metamorphosis. The tadpoles may stay out of water for up to a few days. 
Unlike most digging frogs, the shovelnose frogs dig head first. Other frogs dig rear first. 
Some species are kept as pets.
Species.
Family HEMISOTIDAE

Mantellidae is a family of the order Anura. These frogs are found only in Madagascar and Mayotte.
These frogs are very different from each other. Most species live on land, though some live in trees. Body size ranges from 3 to 10 centimetres in length. The genus Mantella has many similarities with the South American poison dart frogs. 
They are small, aposematically coloured, and secrete alkaloid toxins.
Some members of this group are kept as pets due to their bright colors.

Myobatrachidae is a family of frogs found in Australia and New Guinea. Members of this family vary greatly in size. There are species less than long. This family also has the second-largest frog in Australia, the Giant Barred Frog at in length. The entire family either live in land or water. None of them live in trees.
These frogs do not have the adhesive toe disc cups found in the tree frogs. The family is broken up into three sub-families: Limnodynastinae, Myobatrachinae and Rheobatrachinae. This separation is based mainly on their egg-laying habits. Those of the sub-family Limnodynastinae lay foam nests. The female makes foam with a chemical on her skin. The foam may float on top of water, or be on land. The sub-family Rheobatrachinae has the two species of gastric-brooding frog, and the rest are in the sub-family Myobatrachinae.

Slinky (also known as Spring) is a toy metal spring that tumbles end over end down stairs and even "walks". It was invented by Richard James in 1943, and quickly became a bestseller. Other Slinky toys were developed such as the Slinky Dog and the Slinky Train. Company president Betty James has always kept the toy's price low so children could buy it. It originally sold for $1. Slinky has received many toy industry awards and honors over the years. Its television jingle is the longest running jingle in advertising history.
Origin.
Slinky was the invention of Richard James, a mechanical engineer in the United States Navy. In 1943 he was looking for a way to lessen the vibrations that sensitive equipment endured shipboard in rough waters. An accident during his experiments led to the creation of a "walking", tumbling metal spring. Neighborhood children loved it. James's wife Betty named the toy Slinky after finding the word in a dictionary. The Jameses had 400 Slinkys made by a local machine shop. The Jameses put Slinky on display at Gimbels department store in Philadelphia in November 1945. All 400 units were sold.
Other Slinky products.
The Jameses went into the Slinky business. They invented a machine that could produce a Slinky from 80 feet of steel wire within 10 seconds. A huge advertising campaign was launched in America. James showed television viewers how Slinky worked. Other Slinky toys manufactured during the 1950s were the Slinky Dog, Suzie the Slinky Worm, and a pair of eyeglasses with eyeballs dangling at the end of two Slinkys. Other companies were granted licenses to produce Slinky toys. 
The Jameses divorced. Richard became a missionary in Bolivia. Betty James moved the company to Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania in 1964. She was president of the company from 1960 to 1998. She kept the price of Slinky low so all children could afford one. The original Slinky was $1. In 2008 Slinky cost about $4. She explained the toy's appeal by saying, "It's the simplicity of it."
Slinky Dog.
Very early in the production history of Slinky, Helen Malsed of Washington developed ideas for Slinky pull toys. The company liked her ideas and added Slinky Dog and Slinky Train to their line in 1952. The Slinky Dog was a small plastic dog whose front and rear ends were joined by a Slinky. Malsed received annual sums of $60,000 to $70,000 per year for 17 years for her idea. 
Slinky Dog was reworked in 1995 for Pixar's "Toy Story". James Industries had dropped their Slinky Dog from production, but Betty James liked the new Slinky Dog. She said, "[The earlier Slinky Dog] wasn't nearly as cute as this one." The dog's front and rear ends were made in China, and the Dog put together and packaged in America. The entire run of 825,000 new Slinky Dogs sold out well before Christmas 1995.
Jingle.
The first Slinky television commercial was shown on Miss Patty's Romper Room in 1946. Homer Fesperman and Charles Weagley wrote the Slinky television jingle in 1962. In "Timeless Toys", Tim Walsh writes that this jingle is the longest running jingle in advertising history. In 1990 "USA Today" reported that 90 percent of all adults surveyed knew the Slinky jingle. 
Awards and honors.
Slinky is a part of the Smithsonian Institution's permanent Americana exhibition. In 1999 the United States Postal Service issued a Slinky postage stamp. Slinky joined the Toy Hall of Fame in 2000. A bill to nominate the Slinky as the state toy of Pennsylvania was introduced in 2001, but not enacted. The same year, Betty James was inducted into the Toy Industry Association's Hall of Fame. In 2003, Slinky was named to the Toy Industry Association's "Century of Toys List", a roll call of the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the twentieth century. "Orange Coast Magazine" writes, "[T]he original machines designed and engineered by [James] turn 80 feet of steel wire into a coil in only 10 seconds. Since its introduction, more than 250 million Slinkys have been sold, enough for every person in the United States to have one. Stretched out, the wire would encircle the planet more than 126 times."

A chimaera or chimera in biology is a single organism (usually an animal) made of two genetically distinct cells. The two types of cells may come from separate fertilised eggs or zygotes.
Chimeras that originate from distinct fertilised eggs fused together are called dispermic chimeras. When, on the other hand, the genetically distinct cell types originate from the same zygote, the organism is called a mosaic.
Dispermic chimaeras are formed from at least two fertilized eggs or early embryos fused together. Each population of cells keeps its own phenotype and the resulting organism is a mixture of the two phenotypes.
Microchimerism is a form of chimerism in which a host harbors a small set of genetically distinct cells. This often happens with blood transfusion or transplants, but also during pregnancy due to the two-way cell trafficking between the mother and the foetus.
Recently, epigenetic chimeras have been discovered in mouse models.
Germline chimerism.
Germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells (for example, sperm and egg cells) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own.
Marmosets almost always give birth to fraternal twins. They may have the reproductive cells of their (fraternal) twin siblings. Placental fusion during development in the womb is what causes this.

Exodus International was a non profit and ex-gay Christian group seeking to limit homosexual desire. The group was based in Orlando, Florida. They did not perform or conduct clinical treatment, although they did have a position saying that holistic counselling approaches that can address homosexual behaviors may be beneficial. The techniques involved are abstinence, lessening of homosexual temptations and correcting distorted style of relations to the same or opposite gender. This organization was founded around 1976. It represented over 120 local ministry networks in the United States and Canada and over 150 in another 17 countries. It was closed in 2013.

Petropedetinae are a subfamily of frogs. 
They are placed in the true frog family (Ranidae) by many authors. Some think at least part of this group are a distinct family Petropedetidae. The Cacosterninae and Phrynobatrachinae are then separated as subfamilies. They may even be distinct families Cacosternidae and Phrynobatrachidae. Most members of this subfamily are in the genus "Phrynobatrachus". 
These frogs mostly live in sub-Saharan Africa.
This group of frogs is made up from the following genera:

Rhacophoridae is a family of frog species. They live in tropical regions of Asia and Africa. They are commonly known as shrub frogs. Sometimes they are called "'moss frogs" or "bush frogs." Some Rhacophoridae are called "tree frogs." Among the most spectacular members of this family are numerous "flying frogs."
Most of the species are arboreal. This may include reproducing in trees. Mating frogs, while in amplexus, hold onto a branch, and beat their legs to form a foam. The eggs are laid in the foam. They are then covered with seminal fluid. Then the foam hardens into a protective casing. In some species, this is done in a large group. The foam is laid above a water source, so the tadpoles fall into the water once they hatch.
The species in this family vary in size, from to . Like other arboreal frogs, they have toe discs. This family has the Old World flying frogs, including Wallace's flying frogs ("Rhacophorus nigropalmatus"). These frogs have extensive webbing between their hands and feet. This lets them glide through the air.
Phylogeny.
This group of frogs is related to other frogs:

A bush frog can be one of two types of frogs. They are found in sub-Saharan Africa and one also in Asia:

Constance Elaine "Connie" Britton (born March 6, 1967) is an American movie, stage and television actress. She was nominated three times for Emmy Awards On television, she is well known for her roles as Nikki Faber on "Spin City" (1988–1991), (1996-2000), Tami Taylor on "Friday Night Lights" (2006-2011), as Vivien Harmon on "American Horror Story" (2011) and as Rayna James on "Nashville".

Hurricane Isaac was an Atlantic tropical cyclone. It killed almost two dozen people in Hispaniola in August 2012 and moved over Cuba and Haiti. Isaac then became a Category One hurricane on August 28. It hit near the southeast tip of Louisiana at 6:44 pm that day.
History.
According to the report. Isaac was from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on August 15.
Isaac did not become a tropical depression until August 21.
Isaac was upgraded to a tropical storm that same day as Hurricane Hunters went into the storm and found winds more then 50 mph.
Isaac made its passage along the Lesser Antilles on August 22.
On August 25 the storm made its first landfall on Haiti with winds of 70 mph.
Isaac made its second landfall on Cuba with winds around 60-65 mph on the same day.
Isaac quickly exited Cuba and went towards the Florida Keys on August 26 but even though it did made landfall. It caused heavy rain to the Keys.
Isaac became a Hurricane on August 28 and made landfall as a Category 1 Hurricane with 80 mph.
Isaac moved inland and dissipated.

The Sooglossidae (Seychelles frogs) are a family of frogs. They are found on the Seychelles Islands and India.
All of the species are small land frogs, about in length. They hide under fallen leaves or in rock crevices. They lay their eggs on moist ground, rather than in water. One species lacks tadpoles, with the eggs hatching directly into froglets. The others carry the tadpoles on their back until metamorphosis.
Taxonomy.
The family was first described in 1931 by Gladwyn Kingsley Noble (1894–1940).

The purple frog ("Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis") is a frog species in the family Sooglossidae. It lives in the Western Ghats in India. Common names for this species are Indian purple frog, pignose frog or doughnut frog. It was discovered by S.D. Biju and F. Bossyut in October 2003. 
This frog's body is shaped similarly to that of most frogs. It is somewhat rounded. It has a small head and an unusual pointed snout. Adults are typically dark purple in color. Its cry sounds more like one from a chicken.
The frog spends most of the year underground. It comes out only for about two weeks, during the monsoon. This is to mate. 
Unlike many other digging species of frogs that feed above the ground, this species eats underground. They feed mainly on termites using their tongue. 
The purple frog has one close relative, Bhupathy's purple frog, which also lives in the Western Ghats.
The purple frog starts off living their life at the base of land, but as they get older their bone structure morphs into a structure that becomes efficient for digging into dirt. This allows them to live a majority of their lives underground. Males will rarely come to the surface for mating purposes.
Other ideas.
Scientists say that because the purple frog and Bhupathy's purple frog have close relatives in the Seychelles, which are close to Africa, it is likely that the Gondwanaland idea of why the continents are where they are is right. This idea says that Africa and India used to be one large continent, called Gondwanaland.

The acceleration which is gained by an object because of gravitational force is called its acceleration due to gravity. Its SI unit is m/s2. Acceleration due to gravity is a vector, which means it has both a magnitude and a direction. The acceleration due to gravity at the surface of Earth is represented by the letter "g". It has a standard value defined as . However, the actual acceleration of a body in free fall varies with location.
Why heavier objects do not fall faster than lighter objects.
Isaac Newton worked out that resultant force equals mass times acceleration, or in symbols, formula_1. This can be re-arranged to give formula_2.
The bigger the mass of the falling object, the greater the force of gravitational attraction pulling it towards Earth. In the equation above, this is formula_3. However, the amount of times the force gets bigger or smaller is equal to the number of times the mass gets bigger or smaller, having the ratio remain constant. In every situation, the formula_4 cancels down to the uniform acceleration of around 9.8 m/s2. This means that, regardless of their mass, all freely falling objects accelerate at the same rate.
Consider the following examples:
formula_5
formula_6
Surface acceleration.
Depending on the location, an object at the surface of Earth falls with an acceleration between .
Earth is not exactly spherical. It is similar to a "squashed" sphere, with the radius at the equator slightly larger than the radius at the poles. This has the effect of slightly increasing gravitational acceleration at the poles (since we are close to the centre of Earth and the gravitational force depends on distance) and slightly decreasing it at the equator. Also, because of centripetal acceleration, the acceleration due to gravity is slightly less at the equator than at the poles. Changes in the density of rock under the ground or the presence of mountains nearby can affect gravitational acceleration slightly.
Altitude.
The acceleration of an object changes with altitude. The change in gravitational acceleration with distance from the centre of Earth follows an inverse-square law. This means that gravitational acceleration is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the centre of Earth. As the distance is doubled, the gravitational acceleration decreases by a factor of 4. As the distance is tripled, the gravitational acceleration decreases by a factor of 9, and so on.
At the surface of the Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is roughly . The average distance to the centre of the Earth is .
Using the constant formula_10, we can work out gravitational acceleration at a certain altitude.
Example: Find the acceleration due to gravity above Earth's surface.
∴ Distance from centre of Earth is .
∴ Acceleration due to gravity above Earth's surface is .
Gravitational acceleration at the Kármán line, the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and outer space which lies at an altitude of , is only about 3% lower than at sea level.

The Ba'ath Party is a political party started in Syria in 1947. The word Ba’ath is an Arabic word which means ‘resurrection and renaissance’. The name refers to the main intention of the party which is ‘Arab unity and freedom from non-Arab control and domination’. Baʿthism calls for the Arab world to be a single state.
The Ba’ath Party was set up by Michel Aflaq (1910-1989) a Christian and Salah al-Din al-Bitar (1912-1980) a Sunni Muslim. Their political vision was a mixture of Arab nationalism, Arab socialism, and anti-imperialism. By 1945, the Baathists decided to register their party to become an official party, but their application was rejected by the French mandate which administrated Syria. The theme ‘unity’ became an inspiration for Lebanon, Jordan and other Arab countries in 1948-1951. The connection for Arab nationalism became attractive and popular and Baatism spread out all over the Arab region. The Arab Baʿth Party merged with the Arab Socialist Movement, led by Akram al-Hawrani, in 1952 to form the Arab Socialist Baʿth Party. This was a relative success. It became the second-largest party in the Syrian parliament in the 1954 election. This and the increasing strength of the Syrian Communist Party led to the establishment of the United Arab Republic, a union of Egypt and Syria, in 1958.
After the attack of 1956 in Egypt by Britain, France and Israel, Iraqis realized how cruel these invaders are and that they no longer can’t stay on the side of the British. This bitter awareness was a seed to the Iraqi revolution by the youngsters. Hafaz al-Assad (1930-2000) was the ruler of the Ba’ath Party in Syria and Saddam Hussein (1937-2006) was the ruler of the Ba’ath Party in Iraq. The Ba’ath Party was active in Syria and Iraq after military coups in 1963. 
The Ba’ath party wanted to create unity among Arabs. The ideology of socialism for the Ba’ath Party was social justice for the poor and underprivileged. The slogan was: ‘Unity, Freedom, Socialism’ and ‘One Arab Nation with an Immortal Mission’. The Ba’ath Party was the first Arab political party with pan-Arabist goals. Pan-Arabism is a theory that Arab people and nations should be united, or a movement to achieve such unity. The main goals of Pan-Arabism are that every Arab seeks independence from imperialism and thus creates unity within the Arab community. Since there were common problems related to Western imperialism, the Arabs could come to a compromise to work on this.

The harp seal ("Pagophilus groenlandicus"), also known as the saddleback seal or Greenland seal, is a species of earless seal. They live in the northernmost Atlantic Ocean and parts of the Arctic Ocean. It now belongs to the monotypic genus "Pagophilus". Its scientific name, "Pagophilus groenlandicus", means "ice-lover from Greenland".
Description.
The harp seal has a black face with silvery-gray body. Its eyes are pure black. It has black harp or wishbone-shaped markings on the back. They show little sexual dimorphism. This means there is little difference between the males and females. The baby harp seal (pup) has a yellow-white coat at birth. After three days, the coat turns white and stays white for about 12 days. Adult harp seals grow up to be 1.7 to 2.0 m (5 to 6 feet) long and weigh from 140 to 190 kg (300 to 400 pounds).
Harp seals like to swim in the ocean. They spend little time on land. They are very social animals. They can be very noisy, as well. They will form large colonies where they spend a great deal of time. Many harp seals are able to live up to 30 years in the wild.
On the ice, pups call their mothers by "bawling" and "mumble" while playing with others. Adults "growl" and "warble" to warn off others. Underwater, adults use more than 19 call types during courting and mating.
Reproduction.
Females mature sexually at age five to six. Then each year, they bear one pup. This is usually in late February.
Newborn pups weigh around and are long. After birth, the mother only feeds that pup. During the 12 day nursing period, the mother does not eat. She loses up to per day. Harp seal milk has up to 48% fat, so pups gain over per day.
Weaning is sudden. The mother turns from nursing to promiscuous mating. She leaves the pup behind on the ice. While courtship starts on the ice, mating usually takes place in the water.
Pups are unable to swim or find food until seven to eight weeks old or until the ice melts. This leaves them open to polar bears and other predators. Because they cannot eat, they lose up to 50% of their weight. As many as 30% of pups die during their first year.

The saffron cod "(Eleginus gracilis)", is a type of fish. They are closely related to true cods (genus "Gadus"). It is dark grey-green to brown, with spots on its sides and pale towards the belly. It may grow to 60 cm and weigh up to 1.3 kg.
It lives in the North Pacific, from off the Korean coasts until beyond Bering Straits, off the Alaskan coasts. It normally is found in shallow coastal waters at less than 60 m depth. It may also be found at depths up to 200 m. The saffron cod may also enter brackish and even fresh waters, occurring quite far up rivers and streams. 
Saffron cods begin to mature during their third year of life. They feed on fish and small crustaceans. They are commercially fished in many areas of the northwestern Pacific. The country with the largest catch is Russia. It is used for human's to eat in the Russian Federation and Japan, fresh or frozen.

Brave and Bold is a boys' book written by Horatio Alger, Jr. It was serialized (published in parts) beginning on August 5, 1872 in the New York "Weekly". Also published in the same issue was Alger's poem "Friar Anselmo". "Brave and Bold" was then published in book form by A. K. Loring of Boston in 1873. The story was serialized in "Reader", an English magazine, in 1872, and was one of Alger's few stories to be so published.
Alger had lost some of his steam as the 1870s approached. He had made his literary name in exposing the horrors of life for street children in books such as "Ragged Dick" (1866). As the years passed, the government had taken on these horrors, studies were being conducted, and the plight of street children was being relieved. As a result, Alger was left without a literary subject. Boys' tastes were changing. They knew everything they needed to know about street boys from Alger's many novels about the poor. They wanted cowboys and Indians. Alger's publisher and his editor urged him ramp up the excitement in his books. Alger agreed, but let it be known that his moralizing would remain at its usual high level.
"Brave and Bold" was the first in a new series of Alger novels published by Loring, and the first in which sex rears its head. Before "Brave and Bold", the girls of the hero's age were sisters or simply prop figures. In this new book, Hester Paine, the lovely daughter of Millville's most prominent citizen and the reigning village belle, becomes a source of fascination and contention for "factory boy" hero Robert Rushton and his nemesis, the rich, snobbish, kid glove-wearing youth Halbert Davis.
"Brave and Bold" hit a new high in Alger's work, according Edwin Hoyt, but Hoyt describes the story as a "fiasco". Gary Scharnhorst describes it as "horrifying", and lists a shooting, a stabbing, and a suicide among the book's elements. The book was reviewed by a reader of the children's magazine "St. Nicholas"; he described it as "of the sensational order" and was glad he did not meet its characters in real life. This was the last review of an Alger work published by the prestigious magazine. The book initiated the controversy over making Alger's works available to the young.

The Māori are the indigenous people of New Zealand. They were the first people to live in the islands. 
The Polynesian ancestors of the Māori came to New Zealand between 800 and 1300 AD. There are many theories about where the Maori came from. They arrived from somewhere in tropical Polynesia, either from the Cook Islands or the Society Islands. There is also a widely-recognised theory that the Māori people originated from Vanuatu.
Before Europeans came to New Zealand, the Māori did not need a name for themselves as a people. After Europeans came to New Zealand, the indigenous people called themselves "Māori. Māori" means "normal" or "ordinary". They called other people, especially those who came from Britain, “Pākehā”, meaning "white person". Today, in New Zealand English "Pākehā" is often used as a name for New Zealand Europeans.
Today, over 700,000 Māori people live in New Zealand. They are an important part of the country's culture. This is why they have received special rights from the Government of New Zealand. Their native language, the Māori language, is an official language of the country along with English.

Ancient Greek and Roman writers said that Dido was the founder and first Queen of Carthage. Carthage was a city in the country now known as Tunisia. Dido lived in the 9th century BC (about 3000 years ago). Some parts of her life may be true. Other parts are myths. She is best known from the story about her in the "Aeneid" by the Roman poet Virgil. In some writings about her, she is called Alyssa or Elissa. She was also worshipped as a goddess in ancient Carthage.
Early stories about her life.
The oldest story about Dido was written by Timaeus. He was an ancient Greek historian who lived in the 3rd century BC. One hundred years later, a Roman historian, Pompeius Trogus, wrote about her. His story about her is now lost, but a later Roman historian, Justin, wrote a summary of Trogus' story. In the stories by Timaeus and Trogus, Dido was the daughter of the King of Tyre (a city in the country now known as Lebanon). She was married to Acerbas who was a priest of Hercules. When Dido's brother Pygmalion killed Acerbas, Dido ran away. She took some of her people with her. They went first to Cyprus, and then to the north coast of Africa in the place now known as Tunisia.
When they got to Africa, Dido asked the Berber ruler, a man named Iarbus, if she could buy some land to for her people to start a city. He said that she could buy as much land as she could cover with the skin of a dead ox. She told her people to cut the skin into very thin strips. They laid all the strips out to mark the borders. This gave them a very big piece of land. Dido and her people built a city on the land. The city was named Carthage, and Dido was its first queen. Carthage grew and became a very rich city. Many Berbers also went to live there.
When he saw what a rich city Carthage was, Iarbus wanted to marry Dido. He told her that if she did not marry him, he would make war on Carthage. Dido did not want to marry Iarbus. She still loved her husband . Before her wedding to Iarbus, she built a large fire. She told him that the fire was a ceremony to honor Acerbas. She said that when the ceremony was finished, Iarbus would be her new husband. Instead, she climbed onto the pyre where the fire was burning. Then she killed herself with a sword. After she died, the people of Carthage worshipped her as a goddess. Carthage stayed a very rich and powerful city for 600 years. It was destroyed by Rome in 146 BC.
Aeneas and Dido.
Dido is most well known today for the story told about her in Books 3 and 4 of Virgil's "Aeneid". Virgil's story about the early life of Dido is very like those told by Timaeus and Trogus. But his story of how she died is very different. In Virgil's story, Aeneas, a prince from the ancient city of Troy, goes to Carthage after losing a war against the Greeks (the Trojan War). Aeneas and Dido fall in love. Aeneas decides to stay in Carthage with Dido. But the god Jupiter sends Mercury to tell Aeneas that he must leave Carthage and go to Italy. Aeneas does not want to go, but knows he must do what Jupiter asks. He and his men sail away from Carthage. Dido is very sad and very angry. She builds a large fire to burn all the things that belonged to Aeneas. Then she climbs to the top of the fire and kills herself with the sword that she gave Aeneas when he first came to Carthage.
Most people say that Virgil was the first writer to make up the story about Aeneas and Dido. Others think that he got the idea from a long poem by Gnaeus Naevius called "" ("The Punic Wars"). Most of Naevius's poem is lost, so it is hard to know for sure.
Since Virgil's time, many plays and operas have been written about his story of Aeneas and Dido. Christopher Marlowe wrote a play about them in 1583. It was called "Dido Queen of Carthage". Henry Purcell composed an opera about them in 1688 called "Dido and Aeneas".
The Italian poet Pietro Metastasio also used Virgil's story for a libretto (the story and words for an opera). It was called "". (Its title means "Dido " in Italian.) The first opera to use Metastasio's libretto was composed by Domenico Sarro in 1724. In the next 100 years more than 40 operas by other composers used this libretto.

Anita "Anna" Sergeyevna Tsoy (; born 7 February 1971, Moscow) is a Russian singer-songwriter of Korean descent.
Parents and Early Life.
Her grandfather, seeking free education, emigrated from Korea to the Russian Far East. He, his wife and his children were later caught up in the 1937 deportation of the "Koryo-saram" to Central Asia. Anita's mother was born in 1944 in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR, Soviet Union. She successfully graduated from the Moscow State University and became a chemistry doctor.
She did everything she could to make her daughter educated in all kinds of arts . Anita's favourite one became music. She began violin lessons at a young age; she later studied piano, flute, and guitar. She wasn't a loved one at school. Many classmates, being children of influential parents, often abused her. Most teachers were not as friendly to her as they were to the other classmates.

Faggot (or fag) is an insulting term for a homosexual person. It is usually used to refer to gay men. Many people, especially homosexuals, see it as hate speech. Most prefer the term gay, or sometimes queer. Queer has been taken back for use by the LGBTQ+ community, even with the way the word has been used in the past.
Younger people (including LGBT people) often use terms like "gay," "fag," "faggot," and "poofter" as insults towards people that they don't like. This use many times does not actually link the word to homosexuality and is therefore not seen as homophobic by the LGBTQIA+ community.

Warning coloration (or aposematism) is how animals let other animals know that they are poisonous or dangerous. It is the exact opposite of camouflage. Warning colors are usually some combination of red, yellow, black and white.
Alfred Russel Wallace, a British naturalist, explained it this way, in 1889:
Wallace predicted that birds and other predators would reject conspicuous prey whilst accepting cryptic prey. Later reports confirmed this.
Animals with warning colors move slowly and expose themselves to sight. The sluggishness and exposure helps to advertise their defense. Along with the color and behavior often goes the foul smell of their chemical weapons. The grasshopper "Aularches miliaris" is a very good example. Noxious caterpillars often have thick, leathery cuticles which help them to resist young birds making a 'test'. When the bird takes a peck, disgusting fluid seeps out from special glands on its back. The caterpillar (or other larva) will often survive such an attack, and the young bird has learnt a lesson it will never forget. All in all, the predator is given good warning. Tests show that warning colors definitely do deter predators.
Some individual animals will die or receive damage while birds or mammals on the attack learn about the connection between color and taste. However, if warning costs less than hiding, the animal benefits. And the advertising traits such as colors may serve other functions as well. The patterns may help mate identification within the species, for instance.
Warning coloration is the basis of two different kinds of mimicry: Müllerian mimicry and Batesian mimicry.
Toxin resistance.
There are a number of predators which eat toxic animals. Cases which have been studied suggest there is some kind of cost to be borne for their relative immunity to the toxin.
The rough-skinned newt is toxic, and displays its warning color by showing its abdomen. Throughout much of the newt’s range, the common garter snake ("Thamnophis sirtalis") is resistant to the toxin. In several populations, these snakes successfully prey upon the newts. Toxin resistant garter snakes are the only known animals that can eat these newts and survive.
The snake’s resistance to the toxin has resulted in a selective pressure that favours newts which produce more potent levels of toxin. Increases in newt toxicity then causes a selective pressure favouring snakes with mutations conferring even greater resistance. The price paid by the snakes is that their digestion and body metabolism is slower than related species. Really resistant snakes have slower crawl speeds than snakes with little or no resistance.
This is an example of co-evolution. This cycle of a predator and prey co-evolving is sometimes called an evolutionary arms race. In this case it results in the newts producing levels of toxin far in excess of what is needed to kill any other conceivable predator.
Bright colors.
Animals can, and do, show bright colors which have other functions. The most common functions are:
However, the bright colors used for these functions tend to be different from the standard warning patterns and colors. 
Unknown function.
The coloring of many species has unknown function. This is usually because their life habits have not been studied sufficiently, and because no field tests have been done. One example is the moth "Utetheisa pulchella", the crimson speckled moth. Its association with the plant "Dittrichia viscosa", which has a somewhat unpleasant smell, suggest the moth has warning coloration, but the matter is not settled. The related species "Utetheisa ornatrix", which feeds on other plants, is known to exude (squeeze out) alkaloids to put predators off.

Catarina Pereira (born June 13, 1990) is a Portuguese singer and actress. She competed with her song, "Canta por mim" (Sing for me), for the chance to sing for Portugal at the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. She had the lead role in the Portuguese production of "High School Musical".

Protectionism means that a country has laws or other rules that make it easier for their own products and brands to sell by making goods from foreign countries more expensive or harder to get.
The idea of protectionism is to stop imports (when people buy goods from other countries instead of from their own). Mercantilism is one kind of protectionism.
For example, if farmers from Argentina are selling wheat at a lower price than French farmers are, French people would buy more wheat from Argentine farmers than from French farmers, and French farmers would not get so much money.
The benefits to protectionism is that some people in a country would make more money because they would be able to sell things at higher prices, but on the other hand, other people would lose money because they wouldn't be able to buy the things from other countries that sell them cheaper.
Many protectionists (people who believe in protectionism) support big tariffs (taxes on a trade involving a foreign country) because the government can get a lot of money from the tariffs.
When a country raises a tariff on another country, usually the other country raises their tariffs on that country to get even. This is called a trade war.
Tariffs were popular in the United States during the 1800s, but when the United States made the Hawley-Smoot Tariff a law in 1930, it raised tariffs very high on Europe. In response, Europe raised its tariffs on the United States, which resulted in a trade war. Many economists and historians believe that the tariffs made the Great Depression worse.
Trade-protectionism is favoured by economic nationalists and left-wing parties.
Protectionism is no longer popular now. Instead, people support free trade (the opposite of protectionism where the government makes it easier for the country to trade with other countries). Free trade is favoured by right-wing parties.

David Crockett (August 17, 1786 – March 6, 1836) was an American frontiersman, soldier, politician, and folk hero. He is more often called Davy Crockett. He also has the nickname “King of the Wild Frontier”. He represented Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1827 to 1831 and again from 1833 to 1835. Fighting in the Texas Revolution, he was executed in the Battle of the Alamo at the age of 49.
Childhood and family.
Crockett was born in Tennessee. A replica of the cabin In which he was born stands today in Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park, in Tennessee.
The Crockett family's name comes from the name "Monsieur de la Croquetagne". Monsieur de la Croquetagne was a captain in the Royal Guard of French King Louis XIV. The family became Protestants and ran away from France in the 17th century. Crockett did not have an easy childhood. He traveled around a lot and had many of adventures. He started to hunt with his brothers before his 9th birthday. A little after he started going to school, he beat up a bully. He stopped going to school so that his teacher would not punish him. His teacher told his father that Crockett was not at school. He ran away from home so that his father would not beat him. He started moving around Tennessee, Virginia, and other places, according to a book that Crockett wrote about himself.
He came back home when he was 15, and his family welcomed him. He married Mary (Polly) Finley a day before his 20th birthday. They had three children, but Polly died at a young age.
He married another woman, Elizabeth Patton in 1815. They had three children, together.
Political career.
Crockett served in the Tennessee Militia for a few years and ran for Congress in 1824. He lost his election but ran again in the next election. In 1827, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. As a Representative, he became angry with President Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act, which forced Native Americans to leave their land. He lost his re-election in 1830. However, he ran again in 1832 and won.
In 1834, he wrote a book about himself, "A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett. Written by Himself". He lost re-election to Congress that year.
Texas Revolution.
Around December 1834, Crockett told some of his friends that he might move to Texas if Martin Van Buren became the next president of the United States. The next year, he talked to his friend Benjamin McCulloch about going to Texas, which the belonged to Mexico, but some people fought in the Texas Revolution against Mexico. Van Buren was elected president and so Crockett left Tennessee on Nov. 1, 1835 with three other men to go to Texas and said, "You may all go to hell and I will go to Texas."
He arrived in Nacogdoches, Texas, in early January 1836. On January 14, 1836, Crockett and 65 other men signed an oath before Judge John Forbes to the Provisional Government of Texas for six months that said, "I have taken the oath of government and have enrolled my name as a volunteer and will set out for the Rio Grande in a few days with the volunteers from the United States." Each man was promised about 4,600 acres (19 km2) of land.
He showed up at the Alamo on February 8, where over 100 other men were there. On February 23, a Mexican army, led by General Antonio López de Santa Anna, surrounded the Alamo and was ready to take it over. After the Mexican army had been there for eight days, 32 other men showed up to help Crockett and the other men defend the Alamo.
On March 6, according to Susana Dickinson, before running to his post, Crockett stopped in the chapel to pray. When the Mexican soldiers made it over the walls of the Alamo, they pushed the few remaining defenders back toward the church. The Battle of the Alamo lasted almost 90 minutes. All of the men defending the Alamo died, including Crockett.
Legacy.
Even while he was still alive, many books and plays were written about Crockett's life, some of which stretched the truth. Since his death, he has become a popular figure in American folklore. In the 1950s, there was a television show about him with a song called "The Ballad of Davy Crockett," which was very popular. Many children wore "coonskin" hats to look like him.

Hops are the flowers of the hop plant, which are in the humulus genus. Hops look like little cones, and are used to make beer. They give the beer a bitter flavor. They have been used to make beer for many centuries, and were used by the Romans in the Roman Empire. 

The White Australia Policy was the name given to laws that stopped non white immigrants from coming to live in Australia. These laws were put in place in 1901, and were repealed from the 1950s to 1970s
Overview.
In 1901, 98% of people living in Australia were of European background, with "clean" skin, and with British laws and customs. The government wanted to keep Australia this way. This had an influence on the type of people living in Australia. In 2001, many Australians claimed to have fathers from Europe. About six percent were Asian, and about two percent were Aboriginals. In 2018, overall, about 76% of Australians were white, though about 95% of the countries leaders were white.
In the 1850s many Chinese people, mainly men, came to Australia to search for gold. This lead to anti-Chinese riots on the goldfields at Lambing Flat in New South Wales, and at the Buckland River diggings in Victoria. The Victorian government tried to stop more Chinese from arriving, by charging a special tax of £10 for every Chinese person who came on a ship to Victoria. In 1861 New South Wales passed laws to stop Chinese people coming, and Queensland passed laws in 1877, and Western Australia in 1886. Later men from the Pacific Islands, called "kanakas", were brought to Australia to work on the sugarcane farms in Queensland. This also caused problems because they worked for much lower wages than other people. The new Federal government of Australia acted in 1901 to stop certain types of people coming to work or live in Australia.
Immigration Restriction Act.
The Immigration Restriction Act (1901) listed who could come to Australia and who would not be allowed into the country. The following types of people were not allowed:
Immigration.
This test was made to keep out anyone that the Australian government did not want to allow into Australia without being seen to be racist. Anyone who wanted to come to Australia had to be literate, that is be able to read and write. This would be proved with a dictation test. A person had to be able to write down something read to them in a European language by a government official. It did not have to be in a language that they understood. At first the test was to be given in English, but the government thought that American negroes and Japanese people would be able to pass the test. For example, to keep out people from Malta, they were given the test in Dutch. One person who spoke several languages was given the test in Gaelic. The test could also be given to people in the first year that they were living in Australia. In 1932, this was changed to the first five years, and it could be given many times. From 1902 to 1909, the test was given to 1359 people, and only 52 passed. After 1909, no person passed the test. Anyone who failed the test was forced to leave Australia. This law was used until 1958.
End of policy.
After World War II the Australian government wanted to attract migrants. The Ben Chifley Labor Government started the Snowy Mountains Scheme which needed a large population of labourers. Australians worried less about taking people from different cultures. Through the 1950s, many Southern and Eastern European refugees resettled in Australia, leaving a Europe still recovering from World War II or the Communist Eastern-Block behind. Liberal Prime Minister Robert Menzies' Government brought in the Colombo Plan which brought Asian students to Australian universities to help Asian development. In 1958, Menzies ended the "dictation test" and the Government said well qualified non-Europeans would be suitable. Other laws made it easier to bring non-Europeans to Australia. Prime Minister Harold Holt's "Migration Act, 1966" effectively ended the White Australian Policy so that migrants from different parts of the world could come to Australia, like refugees from the Vietnam War. Finally in 1973, the Gough Whitlam Labor Government made a law that Australian immigration officers should "totally disregard race" when considering migrants. But Whitlam took in less migrants in total, and the number of migrants from outside Europe did not increase until the Malcolm Fraser Liberal Government (1975-1983).

The Hartford Whalers were a professional ice hockey team from Hartford, Connecticut. The Whalers played in the National Hockey League for 18 seasons. The team began playing in the NHL and were originally called the New England Whalers before being renamed the Hartford Whalers in 1979. The Whalers were relocated to Raleigh, North Carolina and were renamed the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997.

The Easter Bunny (or Easter Hare) is a character depicted as an anthropomorphic rabbit. In old stories, the creature brings baskets filled with colored eggs, candy and toys to the homes of children on the night before Easter. The Easter Bunny will either put the baskets in a certain place or hide them somewhere in the house for the children to find when they wake up in the morning.
The Easter Bunny is similar to Christmas's Santa Claus, as they both bring gifts to good children on the night before the holidays they are related to.

Lincoln Logs is the name of a children's toy. They are small logs made for children to build with. They were invented in Chicago, Illinois by John Lloyd Wright, son of the architect Frank Lloyd Wright.
Lincoln Logs were added into the United States National Toy Hall of Fame in 1999.

Led Zeppelin III is the third album from the band Led Zeppelin, released on October 22, 1970. Many of the songs were written while Jimmy Page and Robert Plant visited a cottage in Wales, in a place called Bron-Yr-Aur. The musicians were inspired by the Welsh countryside, and because of this, many songs on the album are written in the style of folk and country. This upset many fans at the time who said that the band should focus on making more rock music, but there were still some rock songs on the album, such as "Immigrant Song" and "Celebration Day”.

The Phoney War was a name for the eight months during World War II from Poland being invaded in September 1939 to France being invaded in May 1940. 
During that time, there were no major military operations in Europe. The United Kingdom and French declared war and a blockade against Nazi Germany. Also, Germany did likewise by beginning the Battle of the Atlantic, and German submarines destroyed many Allied ships. The British Royal Air Force dropped propaganda leaflets on Germany, and Canadian troops began to arrive in Britain. 
In April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. Both sides began to fight each other strongly again. Britain and France needed many weapons quickly and so they began to buy them from American weapon companies. The Americans remained neutral but helped Britain and France by selling weapons cheaply and then by Lend-Lease of military equipment and supplies.

Radiolaria are amoeboid protists which produce mineral skeletons. The skeletons, usually of silica (SiO2), have a central capsule. This divides the cell into inner and outer portions, called "endoplasm" and "ectoplasm". 
Radiolaria are found as zooplankton throughout the ocean, and their skeletal remains cover large portions of the ocean floor as radiolarian ooze. Radiolaria have existed since the beginning of the Palaeozoic era. They take their name from the radial symmetry of most species. They are valuable markers or diagnostic fossils, because they have a rapid turn-over of species. This helps to identify strata, and to correlate strata at different sites.
Radiolaria are heterotrophs (eat other things), but also may include protist algae as endosymbionts.
Structure.
The skeletons of radiolarians are generally organized around spicules, or spines, which extend from the main skeletal mass. Formed from the fusion of many of these spines is the outermost skeleton, the shell or "test". Connecting this shell to the many concentrically organized inner shells are bars or beams, which strengthen and support the structure.
The nuclei and most other organelles are in the endoplasm, while the ectoplasm is filled with frothy vacuoles and lipid droplets, keeping them buoyant. Often it also contains symbiotic algae which provide much of the cell's energy. Not much is known about the living amoebae because they cannot be cultured in the laboratory.

Squeeze are a British rock/new wave band from London. They were active from 1974 to 1982 and 1985 to 1999. They reunited in 2007.

A heat lamp is a lamp (light) with the main purpose of making heat. This is commonly infrared light but white light incandescent lightbulbs are also used. Sometimes the glass of the light bulb is colored to cut out yellow and even higher frequency light (to let the infrared light through, which has most of the heat).
Humans can use these lamps to keep warm, to warm a part of the body that is injured and needs gentle heat, etc. These lamps are also frequently used to keep baby chickens, piglets or other baby animals warm.

Robert "Bobby" Lee Dodd (November 11, 1908 – June 21, 1988) was an American college football coach at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player and coach. He is one of only three people to have done this.
Dodd was born in Galax, Virginia. He moved to Kingsport, Tennessee and played several sports at Dobyns-Bennett High School. After high school, he played as a quarterback at the University of Tennessee. From 1931–1945, he worked as an assistant coach for William Alexander at Georgia Tech. Alexander hired Dodd while he was still a student at Tennessee. Dodd replaced Alexander in 1945 and became the third head coach at Georgia Tech. He retired from coaching after the 1966–67 season, with 165 wins, 64 losses, and 8 ties in his career. He also worked as athletic director for Georgia Tech from 1950 until 1976. Dodd died in June 1988 at the age of 79 in Atlanta, Georgia.
Player.
Dodd was quarterback for the University of Tennessee football team from 1928 to 1930. He played for its coach, Robert Neyland. Dodd wanted to play for Georgia Tech but was not offered a scholarship. In the games that Dodd started at Tennessee, they had a record of 27–1–2.
Dodd played a major role in one famous game. During his sophomore year, in a game against Alabama, "Dodd threw a touchdown pass in that game to tie Alabama, 13–13. Then he punted out of bounds inside the Alabama 1-yard line and Tennessee got a safety on the next play to win, 15–13." This was an important game for both teams since they were rivals.
Another time in Dodd's playing career showed the thinking he would use in his coaching career. "Against Florida in 1930 he got his teammates in a huddle and told them about a play he had used in high school. When the ball was snapped, it was placed on the ground unattended. The players ran in one direction. Then the center returned, picked up the ball, and waltzed to the winning touchdown." Tennessee fans even developed a catch phrase for Dodd during his time there: "In Dodd we trust."
Dodd was selected to be on Grantland Rice's All-American team in 1930. He was the second player from Tennessee to make an All American team. The first was Gene McEver in 1929. In 1959, Dodd was selected for the University of Tennessee's Hall of Fame and to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player. He was elected in the same year as teammate Herman Hickman.
Coach.
Dodd had a 165–64–8 record as head coach at Georgia Tech. He led Georgia Tech to two Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships (1951 and 1952) and one national championship in 1952. While he was coach, Tech played in 13 major bowl games. The school won 9 of these games, including six in a row from 1951 to 1956. His team had a 31-game winning streak from 1951 to 1953.
Dodd took over the Georgia Tech football program after Coach Alexander's retirement in 1944. Dodd's coaching ideas were about developing and treating his players well. He did not believe in hard physical practices. Instead, he liked practices that were about the small details of football. Dodd's ideas led to winning. He set the record for career wins at Tech at 165 career coaching wins including a 31-game winning streak from 1951–1953. He also won two Southeastern Conference Titles and the 1952 National Title. The 1952 title was part of a 12–0 perfect season and Sugar Bowl win over Ole Miss.
Dodd also understood the rivalry with the University of Georgia. His teams won 8 games in a row over the Bulldogs from 1946–1954. They had 176 points to Georgia's 39 during the winning streak. This 8–game winning streak is still the longest winning streak for either side in the series. Dodd ended his career with a 12–9 record against Georgia.
Dodd's career included Georgia Tech leaving the Southeastern Conference. The initial reason for them leaving was a feud between Dodd and Alabama Crimson Tide Coach Bear Bryant. The feud began when Tech was visiting the Tide at Denny Stadium in 1961. After a Georgia Tech punt, Alabama fair-caught the ball. Chick Granning of Georgia Tech was running down to tackle the receiver of the punt, but relaxed after the signal for the fair catch. Darwin Holt of Alabama continued play and hit his elbow into Granning's face. This caused severe breaks in Granning's face, a broken nose, and blood-filled sinuses. Granning became unconscious and suffered a severe concussion. These injuries left him unable to play football ever again. Dodd sent Bryant a letter asking Bryant to suspend Holt. Dodd felt that Holt injured Granning on purpose. Bryant never suspended Holt. The lack of punishment made Dodd angry and caused him to want to leave the SEC.
Another issue for Dodd was Alabama's and other SEC schools' recruiting of players. Schools would recruit more players than they could have on their roster. During the summer practice sessions, the teams would remove extra players. This would happen after the signing day which meant those players could not find somewhere else to play. Dodd asked the SEC leaders to punish the "tryout camps" of other SEC members, but the SEC did not. Finally, Dodd took Georgia Tech out of the SEC in 1963. Tech would play without a league like Notre Dame and Penn State (at the time) during the final four years of Dodd's coaching career. In 1967, Dodd passed the head coach position to his favorite assistant, Bud Carson. Dodd continued to work as athletic director which he had first been hired as in 1950. He would not retire from athletic directing until 1976. In 1983, he said he would like to run a United States Football League team if Atlanta was given one. The league, however, shut down before Atlanta received a team.
Legacy.
Dodd wanted to win every game, but unlike some other coaches, he did not believe in risking his athletes' health in order to win. He believed that the most important part of college football was the college football player.
In honor of the character of Dodd, each year a Division I college coach who has shown leadership both on and off the field is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award. This award is given by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1959 and as a coach in 1993. In 1988, Georgia Tech named its stadium Bobby Dodd Stadium in honor of him. The Bobby Dodd Institute is a group that helps people with disabilities; it is named in honor of Dodd for his help to the disabled.

Wrongful life is a legal action in which someone is sued for not stopping the birth of a severely disabled child. In this type of lawsuit a child and the parents will sue a doctor or a hospital. The doctor or hospital is sued for not giving information about the disability during the pregnancy. The doctor or hospital may have not provided all the information on a genetic case before the pregnancy. The parents argue that if the mother had known this information, she would have had an abortion, or chosen not to become pregnant at all.
In the past, only parents could sue for their "own" damages the occurred as a result of the birth of a disabled child (e.g., the mother's own pregnancy medical bills and cost of psychiatric treatment for both parents' emotional distress resulting from becoming aware that their child was disabled). This cause of action is known as wrongful birth. But the child could not sue for his or her own damages, which were often much more in terms of money and harm.
In four U.S. states, the child is allowed to start a wrongful life cause of action for damages. In 1982, the Supreme Court of California was the first state supreme court to permit the child's right to sue for wrongful life, but in the same decision, limited the child's recovery to special damages. 
Most other jurisdictions, including England and Ontario, have not allowed the wrongful life cause of action.

Baked Alaska is a dessert made of ice cream on top of slices of sponge cake or Christmas pudding and covered with meringue. The whole dessert is then baked in a very hot oven for just long enough to cook the meringue. The meringue is a good insulator, and the short cooking time prevents the heat from getting through to the ice cream.
Its name, but not the recipe, was made at Delmonico's Restaurant in 1867 to honour the new American territory of Alaska.
February 1 is Baked Alaska Day.
Variations.
A slightly changed dessert called Bombe Alaska came from Noel, Alaska. Some dark rum is splashed over the Baked Alaska, and the whole dessert is flambéed while being served.

Eugene T. "Gene" McEver (September 15, 1908 - July 12, 1985) was a Hall of Fame college football player for the University of Tennessee. He was born in Bristol, Virginia in 1908. 
Playing career.
McEver was the first ever All American for the Tennessee Volunteers football team. He played for them in 1928, 1929, and 1931 for coach Robert Neyland. McEver missed the 1930 season with a knee injury. McEver scored 130 points for the Volunteers in 1929, helping them to a 9-0-1 record. The total led the NCAA in scoring that year. That total is still the record for most points in one year at Tennessee. McEver also holds the record for career scoring at Tennessee among non-kickers.
McEver finished his career with 44 touchdowns and 12 points after touchdown for 276 points. He was named to the All-Southern team in 1928, 1929, and 1931, with teammates Bobby Dodd and Herman Hickman. McEver was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954.
Coaching career.
McEver coached at Davidson College in North Carolina from 1937 through 1943. His record there was 16-43-4. McEver also coached the University of North Carolina to a 1-7-1 record in 1944. He was an assistant coach at Virginia Tech from 1944 to 47.

The Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award is college football award given every year to the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision head coach whose team does well on the field, in the classroom, and in the community. The award is named for Bobby Dodd. Dodd was head football coach at Georgia Tech. The award was made in 1976 to honor the values that Dodd held. Coaches who win the award are chosen by a committee of college football experts and all previous winners. The winner is announced during half-time of the Chick-fil-A Bowl on December 31 in Atlanta, Georgia. A formal presentation is held later, usually on the university campus of the winner.
Winners.
Only Joe Paterno of Penn State has received the award twice, in 1981 and in 2005. Four schools have had two different coaches given the award: Michigan with Bo Schembechler in 1977 and Lloyd Carr in 2007; Air Force with Ken Hatfield in 1983 and Fisher DeBerry in 1985, Georgia Tech with Bobby Ross in 1990 and George O'Leary in 2000 and TCU with Jim Wacker in 1984 and Gary Patterson in 2009.

A penalty shootout in association football is a way of deciding who wins match if both teams have scored the same number of goals.
If the score is a draw after 90 minutes, usually the teams will play an extra 30 minutes of extra time. If the score is still equal, then a penalty shootout takes place. Usually each team takes five penalties each, and the team who scores the most wins. If both teams are equal after these penalties, then each team will take one more penalty until one team is ahead.
Penalty shootouts are normally only used in cup matches, and not league matches. If nobody wins in a league match, both teams get one point for the draw. In a cup match often a winner in needed to go to the next round.
Many famous cup finals have been won by penalty shootouts, like the 2006 World Cup final, the 2005 UEFA Champions League final and the 1994 World Cup final.

The Unraveling is the debut album by the American punk rock band Rise Against. Released on April 24, 2001 and produced by punk producer Mass Giorgini. It is the only Rise Against studio album where frontman Tim McIlrath does only lead vocals and does not play guitar. Two songs, "My Life Inside Your Heart" and "The Art of Losing" were used for the unreleased Dreamcast game Propeller Arena.

Physical Graffiti is the sixth album from rock band Led Zeppelin. It was released on February 24 1975 as a double album. This is the first double album the band released, and the songs were recorded over many years, some were old songs that they did not use for other albums, and some were new ones made for this album. The album was very popular with both critics and fans, and it still is, it has one of their most well known songs, the Arab-sounding "Kashmir". The band had a big tour when the album was released, they played concerts in Europe,the US and ended the touring in May 1975 with five concerts at Earl's Court in London. Some of the songs from their London concerts are on their 2003 DVD.

There are many types of matches in professional wrestling.
Singles match.
A singles match also known as a regular match is between two wrestlers. The first person to either win by pinfall or submission is the winner. If one of the wrestlers gets disqualified, or "counted out" (when a wrestler is caught outside of the ring and the referee counts to either 10 or 20, depending on the companys' rules) they will lose the match.
Cinematic match.
A Cinematic match is where there are many different techniques during the filming of it. Unlike a usual match which is done in one take, a cinematic match is typically filmed over a longer period of time. This type of match became more popular during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Empty Arena match.
An Empty arena match is a falls count anywhere match where the wrestlers start the match inside the ring in an arena that has no fans in it and can only end by pinfall or submission inside or outside of the arena. The only people that are present in the arena are the wrestlers, referee, and the camera crew. One of the first known empty arenas matches took place in 1981 at the Mid South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee between Terry Funk and Jerry Lawler. Another well known empty arena match happened between The Rock and Mankind and was shown during the halftime show of Super Bowl XXXIII.
Falls Count Anywhere match.
A Falls Count Anywhere match is a match type where pinfalls or submissions can happen anywhere inside or outside of the arena. Weapons are legal and often used because there are no disqualifications. These types of matches often go into the audience, backstage areas or parking lots.
Flag match.
A Flag match is where flags representing two different countries are placed in neutral corners raised up by a metal pole that is attached to the ring post. To win the match, either wrestler or team of wrestlers must grab their country's flag before the opposition does and raise it to be declared the winner. The only exception to these rules was the flag match that took place at WrestleMania 2 in which the match had to be won by pinfall or submission with the winner of the match getting to wave around their country's flag.
Handicap match.
A Handicap match is where one wrestler or a team competes against a team of wrestlers with a higher number (for example; two vs. one or three vs. two) Usually it is the babyface wrestlers that are outnumbered by the heel wrestlers. Usually in two-on-one Handicap matches, the matches are under tag team rules (The side that has the advantage must tag in and out of the match or risk being disqualified). If both wrestlers on the side with the advantage remain inside the ring at the same time and the referee reaches a count of five, the team or just the illegal wrestler (if elimination rules apply), with the advantage will be disqualified.
Hardcore-type matches.
A hardcore match (also known as a Street Fight, a No Holds Barred match, or other names) is where there are no disqualifications and no countouts. Weapons are allowed to be used and other wrestlers are allowed to interfere in the match. The match must end by pinfall, submission or knockout.
An Unsanctioned match is a match that has no rules and is not recognized as an official match. There is also a version called a Lights Out match where the lights in the arena are dimmed.
A Deathmatch is where there are multiple different weapons used. Popular weapons used are fluorescent light tubes and barbed wire. These matches are usually very bloody and have a high level of violence in them.
A Barbed Wire Ring Rope match is where wrestlers compete in a ring where the regular ring ropes have been replaced with barbed wire. Sometimes the barbed wire is wrapped around the ring ropes. 
An Explosion or Bomb Deathmatch is a type of Deathmatch where there are barbed wire ropes and a piece of wooden board with an explosive on it. Sometimes there is a timer which counts down and when it hits 00:00, explosives go off around the ring. The match can either be won by pinfall, submission, or in some cases, throwing the other wrestler into the explosion. For the timer version, wrestlers usually try to finish the match before the timer runs out and the ring explodes.
An Exploding Barbed Wire Deathmatch was done by All Elite Wrestling (AEW) during their Revolution pay-per-view. It was held between Kenny Omega and Jon Moxley for Omega's AEW World Championship. There was a 30-minute timer, barbed wire ropes and three sections around the ringside with explosives.
Monster's Ball match.
A Monster's Ball match is where the wrestlers are locked inside of a pitch black room for 24 hours with no food or water beforehand. When they are let out, they wrestle a No Disqualification match.
Lumberjack match.
A Lumberjack match is a regular match where the outside of the ring is surrounded by wrestlers. The wrestlers that surround the ring are called "lumberjacks" (females wrestlers are sometimes called "lumberjills"). If a wrestler is knocked out of the ring, the lumberjacks/lumberjills will beat him or her up and put them back in. They are usually split in groups of faces and heels.
Casino Battle Royal.
The Casino Battle Royal is a match done by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). The match has similar rules to the Royal Rumble match except it has 21 wrestlers in it. The wrestlers are selected by a suit of cards that they draw. The drawing of the cards is random and the wrestlers come out when the suit is chosen. The last wrestler that comes out is the wrestler who drew The Joker card. The match begins with 5 wrestlers. 5 more wrestlers come out when the clock hits 3 minutes. The winner of the men's version gets a shot at the AEW World Championship and the winner of the women's version gets a shot at the AEW Women's World Championship.
Bra and Panties match.
A bra and panties match is where a female wrestler or team of wrestlers must strip their opponent(s) to their bra and panties to win.
Tuxedo match.
A Tuxedo match is where two wrestlers wear tuxedos and one wrestlers has to tear the tuxedo off of the other to win.
Submission match.
A Submission match is where the wrestler has to make the other wrestler give up by either tapping out or verbally saying that they quit the match. The match can only be won by submission.
A "I Quit" match is where a wrestler must force the other wrestler to say the words "I Quit" in order to win.
Substance match.
A Substance match is where a wrestler has to throw another wrestler into a container filled with something. Female wrestlers used to fight in matches such as a mud wrestling match or chocolate pudding match. At All Out, Orange Cassidy would defeat Chris Jericho in a Mimosa Mayhem Match by throwing him in a giant vat of Mimosa that was at ringside.
Multi-person matches.
An Elimination match is where a wrestler must pin or submit the other wrestlers to eliminate them from the match. The match differs depending on how many wrestlers are in the match. 
A Tag Team match is between four wrestlers divided into teams of two. One wrestler of each team stands just outside the ring ropes until he is tagged in by his partner by slapping hands/lightly slapping their partners back with the ref watching or both wrestlers can fight at the same time in a "tornado" format. This match is won by pinfall or submission.
A Tornado Tag Team match is where all the wrestlers can be in the ring at the same time. The match doesn't involve tagging in or out like the rules of a normal tag team match. All Elite Wrestling (AEW) has a version of this match called the Anarchy in the Arena match.
An Elimination Tag Team match is where if a wrestler on a team gets pinned or submitted then they are eliminated from the match. To win the match, all wrestlers from a team must be eliminated. WWE holds a similar match called the Survivor Series Elimination match during their Survivor Series pay-per-views.
A Triple Threat match has three wrestlers instead of two. First wrestler to score a pinfall or submission wins. No disqualification or countouts apply.
A Fatal Four-Way match includes four wrestlers competing against each other at once. The first wrestler scores a pinfall or submission is the winner. No disqualification or countouts apply.
A Six-Pack Challenge is a match where six wrestlers compete against each other all at one time. The wrestler who gets a pinfall or submission is the winner. There are no disqualifications or countouts.
WWE features a match called the Championship Scramble in which none of the wrestlers are eliminated. Two wrestlers start the match and every five minutes another wrestler enters until all five participants are present. After the last wrestler enters, there is a predetermined time limit. Each time a wrestler scores a pinfall or submission, he becomes the interim champion. Such reigns are not recorded as title reigns. The winner is the wrestler who scores the last pinfall or submission before the time limit expires. The Unforgiven pay-per view of 2008 is arguably the most prominent showcase of this match type, as all three world titles were contested under a Championship Scramble match.
A Special Guest Referee match is a match where another wrestler acts as the referee in the match. The referee doesn't have to be a wrestler and come sometimes be an authority figure or celebrity.
Non-Wrestling matches.
An Arm Wrestling match is a "match" (moreso a contest) where two wrestlers arm wrestle each other. It usually ends with one wrestler attacking the other after.
A Boxing match is a match where usual boxing rules are in place. It usually ends in cheating from the heel.
First Blood match.
A First Blood match is a match where there are no disqualifications. To win the match, a wrestler must make their opponent bleed.
No Disqualification match.
A No Disqualification match (also known as a No Holds Barred match) is a match where there are no disqualifications. This means a wrestler can hit another wrestler with a weapon or someone can interfere in the match and they won't lose because of it.
Last Man Standing match.
A Last Man Standing match is where a wrestler has to hurt their opponent enough so he cannot make it to his feet before the count of 10. The one who cannot meet the count loses. There are no pinfalls or submission, no disqualifications, no count outs. 
Series matches.
A Best of Series match is where there are multiple match over a period of time. It is usually held in a series of five or seven. To win a Best of Five, the wrestler or team must win three matches. To win a Best of Seven, the wrestler or team must win four matches. 
A Gauntlet match is where a wrestler must defeat a number of opponents in order to win. Standard rules apply.
An Iron Man match is a multi-fall match where there is a set time limit. The way to win the match is to have the most points by the end of the time limit. To gain a point, the wrestler must pin or submit their opponent. A point can also be gained by countout or disqualification. If both wrestlers have the same amount of points as the time limit expires, the match is supposed to be declared a draw, but sometimes they will go to "sudden death" rules. (first wrestler to gain a point after the regulation time has expired will gain the victory). Sometimes the "ultimate submission" stipulation is also used as well.
A Two out of Three falls match is where a wrestler or team has to win twice to win the match. They can win by either pinfall, submission, disqualification, or knockout.
A Three Stages of Hell match is a three match series where the wrestler is allowed to pick any three match types. The first wrestler that score two out of three falls declares the winner.
Stipulation matches.
A Kiss My Foot match is a type of singles match where the loser has to kiss the winner's foot. Known matches include Bret Hart vs Jerry Lawler at the King of the Ring pay per view held in 1995 as well as Jerry Lawler vs Michael Cole at the Over the Limit pay per view held in 2011. A similar version of this match is the "Kiss My Ass Match", where the loser had to kiss the winner's butt and was held during WWF's Attitude Era.
A Last Chance match is where a wrestler challenges for a championship. If they lose the match, they are not allowed to challenge the title holder for the championship again. 
A Loser Leaves Town match is where if the wrestler loses, they have to leave the company. This match was popular during the days of the wrestling territories in the 1980s.
Luchas de Apuestas (gambling fights) are matches where both of the wrestlers put something on the line, usually their mask or hair. The loser of the match would then lose the thing that they put on the line. A masked wrestler would be forced to unmask and a wrestler that put their hair on the line would be shaven bald. This type of match is popular in Mexico. 
A Move match is where a specific wrestling move must be used by a wrestler to win the match. The move depends on the wrestlers in the match or the storyline going into it. 
There is also a match called a Banned Move match where a specific move will be banned in the match, usually on of the wrestler's finishing moves. If the wrestler uses the move, they will be disqualified.
A Retirement match is where if the wrestler loses they have to retire from professional wrestling.
Royal Rumble match.
A Royal Rumble match is a 30-man battle royal with a interval time. Only two wrestlers will start the match with the #1 and #2 draw before the next wrestler enters the ring. Eliminations only counts when a wrestler goes over the top rope with both feet touching the floor. The last wrestler remaining is the winner. This match was created by Pat Patterson.
Ambulance match.
An Ambulance match is fought under hardcore rules; the only way to win is for a wrestler to force their opponent into the back of an ambulance and close the door.
Steel Cage match.
A steel cage match takes place in a steel cage which surrounds the ring. You can win by pinfall, submission or escaping the cage by climbing over with both feet hitting the floor outside or by exiting the door with both feet hitting the floor.
Elimination Chamber match.
An Elimination Chamber match takes place in a large, circular steel cage that surrounds the entire ring. The chamber contains four clear, plexiglass pods which holds four of the six wrestlers in the match. A pod opens every five minutes to let another wrestler into the match. A wrestler can be eliminated from the match by either pinfall or submission inside the ring. The last wrestler remaining is the winner. The match was created by Triple H and was introduced by Eric Bischoff in November 2002.
Hell in a Cell match.
A Hell in a Cell match takes place in a large cage which covers beyond the ring apron is lowered around the ring and leaves a small gap between the edge of the ring and the cage wall. It also covers the top of the cage hence the name 'cell'. There is no disqualification and wrestlers are allowed to go outside the cell. The match can be won by pinfall or submission.
During the early Hell in a Cell matches, many wrestlers got injured. A famous moment happened in 1998 at King of the Ring when The Undertaker threw Mankind off the 16-foot (5 m) high cell through the Spanish announcers table. Undertaker also chokeslammed Mankind through the roof of the cell onto a thumbtack-covered mat in the same match.
Lethal Lockdown match.
A Lethal Lockdown match is a steel cage match where two teams face each other and each member of the teams enter similar to the rules of WarGames. A roof is lowered onto the cage when every member of the teams have entered the match. Multiple weapons are given and hung from the roof.
Lion's Den match.
A Lion's Den match takes place in a octagon cage similar to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). The wrestler must knockout or submit the other wrestler to win the match. The first Lion's Den match took place between Ken Shamrock and Owen Hart at SummerSlam.
Punjab Prison Match.
The Punjabi Prison is one of the unique structures in pro-wrestling. The goal of the match is to escape the two bamboo cages before your opponent does. The Punjabi Prison Match, is a relatively obscure match stipulation — there have only been three in WWE history, The first was The Undertaker vs The Big Show, The Great Khali was originally supposed to be involved in the Big Show’s place but he was forced out of the match after elevated levels of enzymes were found in his liver. The Big Show took Khali’s place and faced off against the Undertaker at the Great American Bash in 2006. Undertaker’s feet ended up hitting the floor first, which gave him the victory. The modern WWE Universe is probably only familiar with the bout as a curiosity coined by The Great Khali, but that doesn’t entirely do justice to the intricacies of the stipulation, or just how brutal the match itself really is.
For starters, while matches like a Steel Cage, Hell in a Cell or even the Elimination Chamber typically trap a Superstar within one enclave, the Punjabi Prison surrounds them with two: First, there are four walls of bamboo that immediately surround the ring in the fashion of a traditional cage. Outside of that stands another, larger, octagonal structure"," topped with a series of razor-sharp bamboo spikes.
WarGames match.
A WarGame match is where there are two rings beside each other and a steel cage surrounding them. Depending on which promotion is doing the match, there is sometimes a roof on the cage. Two teams are locked in the cage and fight. The match starts as a one-on-one match and after five minutes, a new member enters. Every two minutes, a new member of each team enters. The version of WarGames in Jim Crockett Productions and All Elite Wrestling (AEW) have a roof and no pinfalls. AEW's version of WarGames is called Blood and Guts. Dusty Rhodes is credited as the creator of the match.
Inferno match.
An Inferno match is where the ring is completely surrounded by flames when both of the wrestler have entered the ring. The way to win the match is for a wrestler to set their opponent on fire. The match usually ends on the outside so that the paramedics can help the loser of the match. The first inferno match took place at in 1998 where The Undertaker defeated Kane.
Buried Alive match.
A Buried alive match is where there is a grave dug out of dirt found outside the ring. The way to win the match is for a wrestler to throw their opponent into the grave and bury them in dirt.
Casket match.
A casket match, also known as a Coffin match, is where there is a casket near the ring. To win the match, the wrestler has to throw their opponent in the casket and close the lid.
Last Ride match.
A Last Ride match is where a wrestler has to throw the other wrestler into the back of a hearse and close it to win. It is similar to an Ambulance match.
Stretcher match.
A Stretcher match is where a wrestler has to put the other wrestlers body on a stretcher and push them to the top of the entrance ramp to win.
Battle Royal match.
A Battle Royal is a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until only one is left. Typical battle royals begin with 20 or more participants in the ring all at the same time, who are then eliminated by being thrown over the top rope and having both feet touch the venue floor (this is sometimes referred to as the "Shawn Michaels rule", due to the 1995 Royal Rumble, in which he was thrown over the top rope, hung on to the top rope and only had one foot land on the floor). A variation known as the "Reverse battle royal" existed in TNA.
Stadium Stampede match.
A Stadium Stampede match is match held by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). In a Stadium Stampede match, teams of wrestlers fight around a sports stadium. A ring is set up in the middle of the stadium for wrestlers to use. There are no disqualifications and a wrestler has to pin or submit a wrestler of the other team to win the match.
The first Stadium Stampede match took place at TIAA Bank Field, home of the Jacksonville Jaguars (which is also owned by AEW owner Tony Khan).
Survivor Series Elimination match.
In WWE, these matches are primarily featured during its Survivor Series pay-per-views, where they are billed as a "Survivor Series match". Teams of four or five, though on some occasions as many as seven, compete under elimination rules. All other standard rules apply, and team members may tag in and out in any order. While some teams are already established stables, others may need to recruit members for their team.
Weapons match.
A Chairs match is where the only weapon that is allowed to be used is a steel chair. There are no disqualifications in the match. The wrestler can win by either pinfall or submission.
A Item on a Pole match is where a wrestler has to climb the turnbuckle and obtain the item in order to win. There are no pinfalls, no submissions, no disqualification, or no countouts.
In Impact Wrestling, they have a version called a Feast or Fired match. In the match, there are four briefcases hung on each turnbuckle and each contain a contract for a future championship match. One of them has a pink slip and the wrestler that gets it gets fired. What's in the case is revealed later. The wrestler that has the briefcase can either keep it or give it up to save themselves from a possible firing.
A Biker chain match is where a wrestler has to grab a biker chain that is hanging from a pole. The chain is the only weapon that is allowed in the match. The only biker chain match that has taken place was The Undertaker vs Brock Lesnar at No Mercy.
A Ladder match is where a prize is hung above the ring, usually a championship belt or a briefcase with a contract inside. To win you must climb a ladder and retrieve the prize. Weapons are legal in this match type.
A Casino Ladder match is held by All Elite Wrestling (AEW). A giant poker chip is hung above the ring. 2 wrestlers try to climb the ladder a get the chip. A new wrestler enters the match ever 2 minutes. The wrestler who gets the chip, gets a future shot at the AEW World Championship.
A King of the Mountain match is where five wrestlers fight and a hook is hung above the center of the ring. When a wrestler pins or submits another wrestler, they become "eligible" and are able to win the match. The wrestler that got either pinned or submitted has to sit in a penalty box at ringside for two minutes. To win the match, the wrestler has to hang an object (usually a championship) on the hook above the ring. The first Queen of the Mountain match took place at Slammiversary. 
A tables, ladders and chairs match (abbreviated to TLC) is a match where tables, ladders and steel chairs can be used as weapons. The first TLC match took place at SummerSlam in 2000 between Edge and Christian, The Dudley Boyz, and The Hardy Boyz. To win you must climb a ladder and retrieve the prize. Weapons are legal in this match type.
Impact Wrestling has a version called a Full Metal Mayhem match where there are more weapons like thumbtacks added.
An Ultimate X match is where there is a steel pillar on four sides of the ring and a steel X connecting each pillar across the ring. There are two cables also connected across the ring. Either a red X or the X Division Championship hangs in the middle of the cables. The wrestler has to crawl across the cable, reach and take down the hanging object to win. This match is held in Impact Wrestling. 
A Pillow Fight is a match where a wrestler has to pin or submit the other wrestler to win. Surrounding the ring a multiple pillows for the wrestlers to hit each other with and a bed is placed in the middle of the ring. There is a version called the Lingerie Pillow Fight where the wrestlers have to wear lingerie and the Pajama Pillow Fight where the wrestlers where pajamas.
Strap match.
A strap match is where the competitors are placed on the opposite ends of a restraint to keep them in close physical proximity. By definition the strap and anything tied to it are considered legal and in play weapons. The most common rule for victory is for one wrestler to have to go around the ring, touching all four corners in order without stopping but if a wrestler stops touching the corners then it will reset and have to start over again. There are no pinfalls, no submissions, no disqualifications, or countouts in this match.
A Dog collar match is a match where the competing wrestlers are bound together by the neck with dog collars and a chain. 
Tables match.
A Tables match is where a wrestler must put their opponent through a table with an offensive move in order to win. The match can also be used in tag teams, under an elimination match and during a one "fall" rules match. There is also a hardcore version where the wrestler must put the opponent through a table that has been set on fire.
Winner Takes All match.
A Winner Takes All match is where the champion challenges another champion for his/her championship in a "champion vs. champion" stipulation.

David Lange (4 August 1942—13 August 2005) was the Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1984 to 1989.
Early life.
Lange was born in Otahuhu, Auckland. In 1954, he went to a political meeting which made him want to go into politics. After his father was charged with indecent assault, he decided that he would become a solicitor. After finishing school at Otahuhu College, he went to Auckland University to study law in 1960, and graduated in 1966.
In 1967, he was working as a barrister and solicitor in New Zealand. He took over a legal practice in Kaikohe in 1968. He married Naomi Crampton in 1968. He completed his Master of Laws with Honours in 1970.
Politics.
Lange became active in politics when he joined the Labour Party in 1963, while he was still at university. He first tried to get elected to the Auckland City Council in 1974, but did not get enough votes. In 1975, he tried to get a seat in Parliament, but again was unsuccessful. A third attempt in 1977 was successful and he won the seat of Mangere. He held this seat until he left politics in 1996. His first speech in the parliament was very successful and he was seen as a possible leader of the Labor Party. In 1979 he was made the Deputy Leader, and in 1982 Lange was made the leader. When the Labor Party won the elections in 1984, David Lange became Prime Minister of New Zealand.
While he was prime minister, Lange passed a policy in 1985 to not let nuclear-armed ships into New Zealand waters.
He resigned in 1989. He and his wife Naomi separated in the same year after 21 years of marriage. Lange married Margret Pope in 1992.

The molecular clock is the figurative term for a technique which estimates when two taxa diverged in evolution. It is based on comparing the detailed structure of key molecules. The method may be done for species, or any high data used for such calculations is often nucleotide sequences in genome analysis, or amino acid sequences for proteins such as haemoglobin. It is sometimes called a "gene clock" or "evolutionary clock".
Issues.
The key assumption behind the technique is that, in the long run, changes in molecular structure happen at a steady rate.
Researchers such as Ayala have challenged this assumption. According to Ayala, these factors combine to limit the application of molecular clock models:
Nevertheless, the method is now used widely in taxonomy and phylogeny.

Key lime pie is an American dessert made of key lime juice, egg yolks, and sweetened condensed milk in a pie crust. One version uses the egg whites and has a meringue topping. The dish is named after key limes ("Citrus aurantifolia" 'Swingle'), but it is sometimes made with other types of lime. 
The filling in key lime pie is yellow, mostly because of the egg yolks. When it is being mixed, the condensed milk and the acidic lime juice react and make the filling become thick. Many early recipes for key lime pie did not tell the cook to bake the pie because they used this reaction to make the filling thick. Today, because of food safety, the pies are often baked for a short time. The baking thickens the filling even more.
This delectable dessert derives it's decidedly delicious domicile down in the depths of Key West, Florida.

Sequence analysis in molecular biology involves identifying the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid, or amino acids in a peptide or protein. Once a sample has been obtained, DNA sequences may be produced automatically by machine and the result displayed on computer. Interpreting those results is still a task for humans.
Information from sequence analysis is used in many fields of biology. It gives information on the relationship between individual organisms, or between groups of organisms. It shows how closely related they are.
DNA base-pair sequence.
A DNA sequence is the sequence of nucleotides in a DNA molecule. It is written as a succession of letters representing the primary structure of a DNA molecule or strand. If functional, such a sequence carries information for the sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule. The possible letters are A, C, G, and T, representing the four nucleotide bases of a DNA strand — adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine. The sequences are printed next to one another, without gaps, as in the sequence AAAGTCTGAC.
The study of RNA and proteins is more complex. The overall structure of DNA is simple and predictable (double helix). The study of RNA and proteins must include a study of their 3-dimensional structure, which is varied, and influences how they work. To some extent this can be assisted by computer, but has to be verified in each case.
Information on sequences is kept in databases. Since the development of fast production of gene and protein sequences during the 1990s, the rate of addition of new sequences to the databases increases all the time.
Score.
Complete genome analysis has been done on over 800 species and strains. The work is done by a machine, the DNA sequencer, which analyses light signals from fluorochromes attached to the nucleotides. This type of work is gradually becoming less expensive. 
Rough totals.
As of December 2012, whole genome analysis has been completed on about 800 to 900 living species and strains of species. Numbers are approximate, and changing.
Human DNA sequence.
The human genome is stored on 23 chromosome pairs in the cell nucleus and in the small mitochondrial DNA. A great deal is now known about the sequences of DNA which are on our chromosomes. What the DNA actually does is now partly known. Applying this knowledge in practice has only just begun.
The Human Genome Project (HGP) produced a reference sequence which is used worldwide in biology and medicine. "Nature" published the publicly funded project's report, and "Science" published Celera's paper. These papers described how the draft sequence was produced, and gave an analysis of the sequence. Improved drafts were announced in 2003 and 2005, filling in to ≈92% of the sequence.
The latest project ENCODE studies the way the genes are controlled.
Forensic work.
It is not necessary to have whole genome sequences for forensic work, such as identifying a criminal from traces of DNA left at a crime scene, or for paternity cases. At present whole genome sequencing is still very expensive, but fortunately, simpler and cheaper methods are available.
The basic idea is to look at certain loci (places) in the genome which are highly variable between people. About 10 to 15 of these loci are needed for a match, and the legal details differ between countries. A match between a sample and a suspect individual makes it extremely likely that the individual was the source of the sample. This evidence would then be the basis of the prosecution case for a crime. A similar analysis would show that a man was very likely the father of a child. This is really a modern way to do what was done with blood groups before DNA details could be analysed. The methods have been developed mainly by the work of Alec Jeffreys.
Each person’s DNA contains two alleles of a particular gene or 'marker': one from the father and one from the mother. 'Markers' are genes chosen for having a number of different alleles occurring frequently in the population. The following table is from a commercial DNA paternity testing experiment. It shows how relatedness between parents and child is demonstrated with five markers:
The results show that the child and the alleged father’s DNA match for these five markers. The complete test results showed this correlation on 16 markers between the child and the tested man. If a case is tested in court, a forensic scientist would give evidence on the likelihood of getting that result by chance.
DNA testing in the US.
There are state laws on DNA profiling in all 50 states of the United States. Detailed information on database laws in each state can be found at the National Conference of State Legislatures website.
Ancient DNA.
Ancient DNA has been recovered from some sources. The record for survival of DNA suitable for sequence analysis is 700,000 years. A horse skeleton buried in permafrost has provided bones with some DNA surviving. The sequence was only 70% complete, but it was enough for researchers to say "It would not look like a horse as we know it... but we would expect it to be a one-toed horse". For comparison, researchers had access to DNA sequences of modern horses, donkeys and Przewalski's horse.

A phylogeny is a proposal of how organisms are related by their evolutionary history.p336 It is based on the evidence that all living things are related by common descent. The evidence for phylogeny comes from palaeontology, comparative anatomy, and DNA sequence analysis.
The main product of phylogenetics is a phylogenetic tree or tree of life. This is a diagram showing a pattern of ancestor/descendent relationships. Information may be related to geological periods or estimated dates. A biological classification is another type of product. 

A fedora is a hat. The name of the hat comes from a play called Fédora by Victorien Sardou, named after the main character. Popular in the early 20th century, it has become a stereotype for gangsters or private investigators (PIs).
They mainly come in black, sometimes with a band of coloured fabric around the rim.
Some people, such as Jack Abramoff and Richard W. Lariviere, become known for wearing fedoras.

The giant Gippsland earthworm ("Megascolides australis") is one of Australia's 1,000 native earthworm species. These Giant earthworms average at 100 cm long and 2 cm in diameter and can reach 3 m in length. It is difficult to measure length, as the worms will stretch, so scientists use weight to estimate the size. The average weight of a fresh adult worm is about 200 grams. They have a dark purple head and a blue-gray body.
The worms are found in the Bass River Valley of South Gippsland, near Korumburra and Warragul. They are only found in a small area, of about 100,000 hectares. They live in small pockets of blue-grey clay close to water. They live in burrows about 500mm deep, and can burrow as deep as 1.5m.
The habitat the worms used to live in was tall eucalypt forests. Most of this has been cleared for farming, but the worms have continued to survive because they live deep underground. They have been listed a vulnerable species because of these changes. The worms only lay a single egg, between 4-7cm in size. These can take up to one year to hatch, and the worms take several years to become adults, and be able to reproduce. This slow rate of growth, also makes them a vulnerable species.

Piyush "Bobby" Jindal (born June 10, 1971) is an American politician. He was Governor of Louisiana between 2008 and 2016. Before becoming Governor, he was a Republican Representative in the United States Congress. After his gubernatorial tenure, he was a Republican candidate for President of the United States in the 2016 Presidential elections.
Jindal became governor at the age of 36, making him one of the youngest citizens ever elected to the Governor's office.
Early life.
Jindal was born in Baton Rouge to Indian parents, Amar and Raj Jindal, who had immigrated to Louisiana in 1971. He grew up in Baton Rouge and went to school there. Jindal received secondary education at Brown University and Oxford University with concentrations in government and medicine. After graduating from college, Jindal helped several businesses in Louisiana.
Governor of Louisiana (2008-16).
Jindal took the oath of office on January 14, 2008 at age 36, becoming the youngest sitting governor in the US and the first Indian-American governor in United States history. Later in his tenure, he was the second youngest governor after fellow Republican Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina. Jindal and Haley are the only Indian-Americans to hold the office of governor in any state in the United States.
Jindal is a conservative Republican who believes in lowering taxes for all classes. As governor, Jindal fought against dishonest politicians. Jindal favors relaxed gun laws and has spoken at the National Rifle Association of America.
Jindal, traditionally an opponent of excess federal expenditures and activity in states, asked for federal money and manpower after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. He was heavily criticized by the White House and others for insisting that the States be responsible for their own affairs. After Hurricane Katrina, he was critical that the Federal government would not do more, faster.
He also came under criticism for never asking for more safety inspectors (the Gulf inspectors are a small fraction of the staffing of other regions relative to the number of offshore oil wells.) Jindal also never spoke against the safety record of BP prior to the spill. Defenders of his record argue that he and other Louisiana politicians, made a reasonable tradeoff decision, and Federal resources should be used to assist Louisiana since the oil that is produced benefits the entire country.
On January 11, 2016, Jindal left office due to term limits. He was succeeded by John Bel Edwards.
Personal life.
Jindal is a Catholic and was baptized during college. He is married to Supriya Jindal, with whom he has three children.
2016 presidential campaign.
On May 18, 2015, Jindal formed a presidential exploratory committee to determine whether he would run as a candidate in the 2016 Presidential election. Jindal announced his candidacy on June 24th, 2015. He was the first Indian - American to run for president. After poor debate performances and polling numbers, Jindal officially suspended his presidential campaign on November 17th, 2015, saying "this [was] not [his] time". He subsequently endorsed Marco Rubio.

In statistics, a population is a set of things from which samples may be drawn. This allows statistical inferences to be drawn, or estimates made of the total population. For example, if we were interested in crows, then we would sample the set of crows which is of interest. The population of crows is limited to crows that exist now or in the future. Probably, geography will be a limitation in practice. To fairly represent the whole population a sample needs to be random. 
Population is also used to refer to a set of measurements or values, not only cases actually observed. Suppose, for example, we are interested in the set of all adult crows now alive in the county of Cambridgeshire, and we want to know the mean weight of these birds. For each bird in the population of crows there is a weight, and the set of these weights is called the population of weights.

The short-tailed shearwater ("Ardenna tenuirostris", formerly "Puffinus tenuirostris") is a migratory seabird of the Procellariidae family. It breeds in Tasmania and south-eastern Australia. It can also be called yolla or moonbird, and is commonly known as the muttonbird in Australia.

The British Home Guard was a defence organisation of the British Army during World War II. It was a secondary defence line. It was meant to stop invasion by Nazi forces.
The Home Guard existed from 1940 to 1944. It was composed of one and a half million volunteers who were otherwise not allowed to go into military service. The main reason for this was old age. This led to the nickname "Dad's Army". The Home Guard guarded the coastal areas of Britain from enemy threats, like paratroopers. They also helped guard some industrial areas, such as factories and airfields. It was widely popularised after the war by the comedy show "Dad's Army".
History.
The beginning of the Home Guard are usually traced back to Captain Tom Wintringham. When returning from the Spanish Civil War, Wintringham wrote a book called "How To Reform The Army". In it, he writes about how Britain could make something similar to the Spanish International Brigades in the Civil War. Although the book was well received, many of its suggestions were ignored at the time. This was because the tensions in Europe did not seem likely to escalate into war. 
Following a series of events, Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for War at the time, gave a radio broadcast on 19 May 1940. He asked for volunteers to join the Local Defence Volunteers, as it was known in the start. It originally was given jobs that were not related to combat. It worked as a sort of 'armed police force'. However, after complaints from members, the government allowed it to "delay and obstruct" the enemy advance. This was putting mostly untrained and unwell people armed with aging weapons against trained troops. Later on in the war, it was renamed the Home Guard, following pressure by Prime Minister Winston Churchill. If the Natzis had crossed the channel the Home Guard wouldn't have stopped the Germans for very long.

Skeletons is the fourth studio album by American rock band, Hawthorne Heights. It is their first and only studio album through Wind-up Records. The release date for the album was June 1, 2010. The album has 13 tracks. The album is produced by Howard Benson.
The first song released as a single from the album is "Nervous Breakdown".
2009 Never Sleep Again tour.
Because the band member who did the harsh vocals for the band died, the album before this one, "Fragile Future", didn't have any death growls in it. During the 2009 tour, though, one of the other band members started using these vocals for the band, so this album has them again.
Other music groups like Just Surrender, Monty Are I, Punchline, and Anarbor went on the tour too.
During the tour the band played a song called "End of the Underground" and passed out download cards for the song "Unforgivable". These were the first two songs anyone heard from the new album.

Evelina or "The History of a Young Lady's Entrance into the World" is a novel written by English writer Frances Burney and first published in 1778. The novel first came out secretly, but the poet George Huddesford revealed that Burney was the writer of "Evelina" in what Burney called a "vile poem". When it was known that Burney had written "Evelina", it immediately made her very famous.
In this novel of letters, beautiful Evelina Anville, the heroine, leaves her quiet home for the first time to go to London. Through many dangers and delights of fashionable society, Evelina grows in character and wisdom and finds love with Lord Orville. This sentimental novel of romance and satire was an influence to Jane Austen and Maria Edgeworth.
Background.
"Evelina" is actually a sequel. Before that was another book that never came out in print. It was the sequel of a finished book titled "The History of Caroline Evelyn". On or around her 15th birthday in June, Frances Burney burned all of her writings. Among the works she burned, there was a complete work of fiction, "The History of Caroline Evelyn". This was four months before the wedding of Mr. Burney and Mrs. Allen, Burney's new stepmother. It is not clear why she burnt it. However, it is likely that she did it because Mrs. Allen did not like her writing. However, the story of "Evelina" was still in her mind, and she began writing it secretly. When she was at the third volume, she felt guilty. She told her father that she was writing a book, but did not explain more, and asked him if she could print it. Dr. Burney laughed and said yes.
"Evelina" came out in January 1778. It was immediately popular. Almost everyone praised the book. Dr. Burney did not know who was the writer until June, when Burney' sister told him. He read it with "fear &amp; trembling", but liked it. He later came and praised Frances for writing so well. Burney was so happy she "threw herself" into his arms and burst into tears.
Summary.
Volume one.
The novel begins with a letter from Lady Howard to her friend, the Reverend Arthur Villars. In the letter, Lady Howard says that Madame Duval (the grandmother of Evelina) is going to visit England to see her granddaughter Evelina again. In his reply, Reverend Villars tells her about Evelina's history. 18 years ago, Mme. Duval had been very angry with her daughter Caroline, Evelina's mother, when she ran away with Sir John Belmont. After they had married, Sir John Belmont burnt up the marriage papers, and said that it was the same as if they had never married. Unhappy, she went back to Reverend Villars, who had brought her up, as he now brought up Evelina. There, she gave birth to Evelina, and died. Reverend Villars is afraid that Mme. Duval might make Evelina die shamefully like her mother Caroline.
Reverend Villars wants to keep Evelina away from Mme. Duval, so he lets her visit Lady Howard's home. While she is there, they get news that Lady Howard's son-in-law, Captain Mirvan, is coming back to England. Evelina wants to see what London is like, and asks Reverend Villars to let her go there. Sadly, the Reverend says yes.
In London, people are attracted by Evelina's beauty and doubtful birth. Evelina, who is intelligent, but very inexperienced, does not know about the rules of 18th century London society. Because of this, she makes many mistakes. She falls in love with Lord Orville, a handsome, modest, and polite man. Another man, Sir Clement Willoughby, is in love with Evelina, but her birth and his character make him try flirting with her instead of wishing to marry her. Evelina is confused and embarrassed by his behavior, but does not know how to stop him.
In London, Evelina is very surprised to meet her grandmother and some of her cousins, the Branghtons. She is embarrassed by their impolite behavior and thinks that Lord Orville will never love her. The Mirvans return to the country, taking Evelina with them.
Both Evelina and the Reverend are unhappy to hear Mme Duval's wish to sue Sir John Belmont. Lady Howard writes to Sir John Belmont instead, telling him about Evelina. Evelina waits for the answer fearfully.
Volume two.
Sir Clermont Willoughby comes to Lady Howard's house without being invited. He and Captain Mirvan dress up like robbers to play a trick on Mme. Duval, whom Captain Mirvan hates. They tell her that M. Du Bois, her friend, is in jail. Afraid, she goes to see if it is true with Evelina. While Captain Mirvan throws Mme. Duval into a ditch and ties her up, Sir Clement Willoughby talks to Evelina privately. Evelina feels very sorry for Mme. Duval, and tries to make Captain Mirvan stop his tricks, but he only becomes angry. Sir Clermont Willoughby offers to go away from Lady Howard's house, and leaves, to Evelina's satisfaction.
Shortly after he leaves, Lady Howard receives a letter from Sir John Belmont. He says that he is already bringing up a daughter of Caroline, and that she will inherit his money. Evelina is very confused, and Mme Duval is furious. She visited Reverend Villars and said she must take Evelina to sue Sir John Belmont. The Reverend says no. Then she threatens that if Evelina does not live with her in London, she will not give Evelina her money when she dies. "To me, I own, this threat seemed of little consequence (importance)," writes the Reverend, "but...my diffidence (fear, shyness, doubt) of the right I have of depriving (taking away) her of so large a fortune...induced me to listen to her proposal". He tells Evelina to be careful, and "...not only "judge" but..."act" for yourself". Evelina goes with Mme Duval back to London.
Evelina lives with the Branghton family, and is very unhappy. Mme Duval is very angry to find out that she had been tricked by Captain Mirvan when she finds M. Du Bois at the Branghton's house. At the Branghtons' house, she meets a very poor, melancholy Scottish poet, Mr. Macartney, and sees him with guns in his hands, saying, "O God!--forgive me!" Thinking he is trying to kill himself, she stops him and cries, "O Sir! have mercy upon yourself!" She later finds out he had been planning to rob people by frightening them with his guns for money, because the Branghtons had threatened to put him in prison if he didn't pay money to stay at their house. He had fallen in love with a lady, but the lady's father had been so angry, they had fought, and the father had become sick. When he told this to his mother, she told him the lady's father was actually his father, who had left them long ago - so the lady he had loved was actually his sister! Evelina gives him her own money, and makes friends with him.
She is very sad with the Branghtons, however. Once, they visited Marybone, a pleasure garden. There, Evelina was attacked by a drunken sailor and saved by prostitutes. While she is with the prostitutes, she meets Lord Orville again. She is very surprised when he comes to visit her in the unfashionable part of London and again is kind to her. Later, the Branghtons use Evelina's name to ride in Lord Orville's carriage, even breaking its glass. Horrified, Evelina writes a letter to Lord Orville saying that she was sorry for what the Branghtons did, and the Branghtons had used her name without even telling her. She is shocked when she gets a insulting reply from Lord Orville. "Oh...how have I been deceived in this man!" Soon after, she returns to Reverend Villars. There, she becomes very ill. Worried, the Reverend sends her to Bristol Hotwells, a vacation town at Clifton Hill, with her "extremely clever" neighbor, Mrs. Selwyn.

Geothermal energy (from the Greek roots "geo", meaning earth, and from "thermos", meaning heat) is a renewable energy made by heat inside the Earth's crust.
Although the Sun does heat the surface of the Earth, the heat from inside the Earth is not caused by the Sun. The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust comes 20% from the original formation of the planet, and 80% from the radioactive decay of minerals. The Earth is hottest at its core and, from the core to the surface, the temperature gets gradually cooler.
Resources of geothermal energy range from the shallow ground to hot water and hot rock found a few miles or kilometers beneath the Earth's surface, and down even deeper to the extremely high temperatures of molten rock called magma. It has been used for bathing from Paleolithic times, but is now better known for making electricity.
All over the world, geothermal energy was used to make about 10 gigawatts of electricity in the year 2007, about 0.3% of the electricity used around the world. When used to generate electricity, geothermal power plants typically offer constant output.
Geothermal energy is also used directly for district heating, or in other heating and cooling applications. Buildings in Iceland are heated in this way from the country's many geothermal sites.
Power plants and thermal applications of geothermal energy are mature technologies, whereas enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) projects are a new type of application.
Almost everywhere, the ground 10 feet (3m) below the Earth's surface maintains a nearly constant temperature between 50° and 60 °F (10° and 16 °C). Geothermal heat pumps can tap into this resource to heat and cool buildings. A geothermal heat pump system consists of a heat pump, an air delivery system (ductwork), and a heat exchanger - a system of pipes buried in the shallow ground near the building. In the winter, the heat pump uses power to remove heat from the heat exchanger and pumps it into the indoor air delivery system. In the summer, the process is reversed, and the heat pump uses power again to move heat from the indoor air into the heat exchanger. The heat removed from the indoor air during the summer can also be used to provide a free source of hot water. The power to run the heat pump comes from another source.
Geothermal energy escapes as hot water at many hot springs or as steam at geysers.
In the United States, most geothermal reservoirs of hot water are in the western states, Alaska, and Hawaii. Wells can be drilled into underground reservoirs for the generation of electricity. Some geothermal power plants use the steam from a reservoir to power a turbine / generator, while others use the hot water to boil a working fluid that vaporizes and then turns a turbine. Hot water near the surface of Earth can be used directly for heat. Direct-use applications include heating buildings, growing plants in greenhouses, drying crops, heating water at fish farms, and several industrial processes such as pasteurizing milk.
Hot dry rock resources occur at depths of 3 to 5 miles (5–8 km) everywhere beneath the Earth's surface and at lesser depths in certain areas. Access to these resources involves injecting cold water down one well, circulating it through hot fractured rocks, and drawing off the heated water from another well. Currently, nobody uses this method commercially. Existing technology also does not yet allow recovery of heat directly from magma, the very deep and most powerful resource of geothermal energy. 

Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays is the former acronym of , an American organization. Since 2014 the organization has been called PFLAG. It is devoted to the cause of LGBT rights. The organization started in 1973 when Jeanne Manford watched in horror as the police of New York City ignored her gay son being thrown down an escalator, during a protest for gay rights.

"Swing Life Away" is a song by hardcore punk band Rise Against. It is from their 2004 album "Siren Song of the Counter Culture". It was first written by Tim McIlrath and Neil Hennessy, the song is different from most of Rise Against's other songs because it is performed and recorded acoustically. The lyrics are happy and speak of happiness with a less-than-perfect life, although they maintain the band's characteristic themes of self-analysis and hope. At a show at Festival Hall in Melbourne, Australia, McIlrath stated the song was written about a good friend of the band who helped them whilst they were lesser known.

The 1910 Cuba Hurricane was one of the worst tropical cyclones that has ever hit Cuba. The storm formed in the southern Caribbean Sea on October 9, 1910. It grew stronger as it moved northwest. It then made landfall on the western end of Cuba. The storm made a loop over open water, and then began moving towards the United States. After crossing Florida, the storm moved near the rest of the southeastern United States and passed out to sea.
Because of the storm's loop, some reports said it was actually two hurricanes. In Cuba, the storm was one of the worst disasters in the island's history. There was bad damage and thousands of people lost their homes. In Florida, the storm also caused damage and caused flooding in some areas. It is not known exactly how much damage the storm caused. However, losses in Havana, Cuba were over $1 million. At least 100 people died in Cuba alone.
Meteorological history.
On October 9, a type of storm called a tropical depression began in the southern Caribbean Sea. It was north of Panama. The storm grew stronger while it moved toward the northwest. It became a tropical storm on October 11. On October 12, it became a hurricane. The next day, the storm was seen to the southwest of Cuba. For a short time, it was a Category 3 hurricane measured on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm then hit western Cuba and crossed the island. It moved over the Gulf of Mexico and slowed down.
The hurricane was steered, or moved, by an area of high pressure (a type of weather system) to the north. Over warm water in the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane quickly grew stronger. It then moved in a small circle, and on October 16, it reached its highest power. It had winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). The hurricane turned to the northeast and again hit western Cuba. It began to move near the Florida Panhandle on October 17. The storm hit Cape Romano, and moved to the north. Now over land, the hurricane became weaker. After crossing Florida, it curved to the northeast and entered the Atlantic Ocean. The storm probably died out on October 23.
The storm was unusual because it was first thought to be two different hurricanes. This is because of the loop it made in the Gulf of Mexico. One paper reported that the first hurricane died in the central Gulf of Mexico; the second hurricane formed and hit Florida. The storm's path was debated, and it was later found to be a single cyclone.
Impact.
On October 15, all ships in a area around Key West were warned of the storm. Many ships stayed in harbors. Storm warnings were also put up.
Cuba.
The storm caused bad damage in Cuba. It was considered one of the worst tropical cyclones on the island. Strong winds and a lot of rain caused flooding in streets, ruined crops (mostly tobacco), and damaged farms. The hurricane affected many towns, including Casilda. The town of Batabanó was left under water. The hurricane halted communication to other areas. Most of the deaths and damages were reported to be in the Pinar del Río Province.
The "New York Times" wrote that Cuba had "probably suffered the greatest material disaster in all its history". Thousands of peasants, or workers, lost their homes. The country's capital, Havana, also suffered bad damage. On the coast, many ships carrying valuable items sunk. The storm also badly damaged goods kept on wharves. Tall waves crashed on land and caused flooding. Many boats were wrecked by the storm. The high waves flooded about of Havana's coastal land.
At least 100 people were killed by the storm, mostly because of mudslides, including five people in Havana. However, some reports say the death toll was as high as 700. Damage caused by the storm cost millions of dollars. In Havana alone, $1 million in losses were reported.
"Holliswood".
A ship, the "Holliswood", became stuck in the storm in the Gulf of Mexico. It left New Orleans on October 1 and was carrying cypress wood. The ship's crew fought the storm for days. The "Holliswood" was blown miles off its path. Its owner, Paul Mangold, said:
A steamboat called the "Harold" saw the ship and rescued all of the crew. However, Captain E. E. Walls said he wanted to stay behind. The "Holliswood" was badly damaged. The crew told the captain that the ship would be unable to float in five more hours. After the crew was rescued, Captain Walls struggled for days without food or fresh water. On October 20, another ship (the "Parkwood") rescued Walls. He was unconscious, and thought to be dead. When he was on the "Parkwood", he woke up, but was delirious. He asked to be put back on the "Holliswood". Instead, the "Parkwood" pulled the damaged ship to land.
Florida.
At Key West, Florida, winds blew at . Many docks were destroyed. Damage in the Florida Keys was worth around $250,000 (1910 USD, or $5.7 million in 2009 dollars), and houses near the ocean were damaged. Strong winds pushed water out of the Tampa Bay. High waves from the sea moved over land, and people had to hold onto trees to survive. Some citrus crops were destroyed. The wind tore the roofs off homes and shook buildings off their foundations. 
Seven men died at Punta Gorda when some Cuban ships were wrecked. Near there, one man and a baby drowned, and another died trying to cross a flooded river. A French steamship, the "Louisiane", crashed into land. There were 600 passengers on the ship. All people were rescued by another ship.
The hurricane blew down many pine trees near Jupiter, Florida. One man near Lemon City was killed by falling wood. However, the storm's effects on the east coast of Florida were not as bad as they were in other places. Part of the Florida East Coast Railroad was washed out. The storm blew an American ship aground at Boca Raton. Three people died, and the rest of the crew was stuck for 12 hours.

Bundala National Park is a protected national park in the south east of Sri Lanka. The area of 6216 hectares was first protected in 1969. It is an important wetland and was added to the list of Ramsar sites in 1990. There are many animal species living in the park including elephants and turtles. Because of the wetalnds there are many species of bird which come to the park, including flamingos, pelicans, and storks.

A head coach, senior coach or manager is a person who trains and develops men and women who play sports. They usually hold a more public profile and are paid more than other coaches on the team. In some sports such as soccer and baseball, the head coach is called a manager. In other sports, such as Australian rules football, they are called a senior coach. Some sports that use the phrase "head coach" include American football and basketball. 
These head coaches sometimes have other coaches that report to them. These assistant coaches focus on one part of the team rather than the whole team. Assistant coaches often work in offensive positions or defensive positions. They can sometimes coach just one position on the team such as a coach just for the quarterbacks in American football. 

William A. Alexander (June 6, 1889 – April 23, 1950) was the third head football coach at Georgia Tech. Alexander graduated from Georgia Tech in 1912 as valedictorian of his class. Alexander became head coach after John Heisman retired in April 1920. 
As coach, he led Georgia Tech to three SIAA titles (1920, 1921, 1922) and its second national championship in 1928. In 1944 he retired from coaching. He was replaced by Bobby Dodd who was one of his assistant coaches. The Alexander Memorial Coliseum at Georgia Tech is named after him.

Uzziah (����������� in Hebrew, meaning "Yahweh is my strength"; ; ), also known as Azariah (��������� in Hebrew; ; ), was the king of the ancient Kingdom of Judah, and one of King Amaziah's sons, whom the people chose to rule after his father (; 2 Chronicles 26:1). He was 16 years old when he became king of Judah and ruled for 52 years. He "did that which was right in the sight of the Lord" (; ). According to the Bible, at first he was a good king and had great success. His fields and vineyards grew well, he dug many wells and towers in the desert, he defeated his enemies with a strong army, and he became very powerful. A seal with Uzziah's name has been found in a cistern at Tell Beit Mirsim.
However, he grew proud, and entered the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense (). Azariah the priest with 80 other priests came to him and said, "Leave...for you have been unfaithful...you will not be honored by the LORD God". Uzziah became angry, but while "...he was raging at the priests...leprosy broke out on his forehead", and he "...had leprosy until the day he died". Because of this, his son Jotham ruled the palace and the people of the land. He died and was buried in a field that belonged to the kings. Probably because of his leprosy, Uzziah was buried in a cemetery belonging to the kings, but not in the tombs of the kings.

Blubber is a layer of fat inside the skin of some animals, such as whales and seals. Blubber keeps these animals warm. Inuits invented blubber lamps, and many other people also used oil from blubber in their oil lamps.

Ann Radcliffe (July 9, 1764 - February 7, 1823) was an English novelist. 
Early life and education.
She was born in London. Her father was a trader, but when she was little, she lived mostly in the houses of richer relations. In 1772 her family moved to Bath, where it is possible she may have gone to a school run by Sophia and Harriet Lee. 
Writing.
Her first tries to write romance stories were "The Castle of Athlin and Dunbayne" (1789) and "A Sicilian Romance" (1790). They were both published secretly. "The Romance of the Forest" (1791) made her famous as the writer of Gothic romances, the "hobgoblin romance", later called "the Radcliffe romance". Two novels published when she was alive, "The Mysteries of Udolpho" (1794) and "The Italian" (1797), helped make her famous as "the Great Enchantress". Radcliffe was also a great traveller. She made a book after she traveled to the Continent, "A Journey Made in the Summer of 1794, through Holland and the Western Frontier of Germany...To Which Are Added Observations of a Tour to the Lakes" (1795). But the tours written about in the novels were based on travel books, landscape paintings, and imagination. Walter Scott called Radcliffe "the first poetess of romantic fiction". 
Personal life.
She married in 1787 William Radcliffe, who later became the editor of the "English Chronicle". It was probably with his help that she began writing for fun. Even though she was famous, Radcliffe liked to be private. 
Death.
She later had asthma, and died from an asthma attack in 1823.

Alan Samuel Colmes (September 24, 1950 – February 23, 2017) was an American radio and television host, former comedian and author. His talk radio show is distributed by Fox News Radio. He was the writer of the book, "Red, White and Liberal: How Left is Right and Right is Wrong". From 1996 to 2009, Colmes was the co-host of "Hannity &amp; Colmes", a nightly political debate show on Fox News Channel.
Colmes died at a Manhattan medical center on February 23, 2017, at the age of 66 after suffering from lymphoma. 

Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock formed from mud. The mud is a mix of flakes of clay minerals and tiny fragments (silt-sized particles) of other minerals, especially quartz and calcite. The ratio of clay to other minerals is variable. Shale has breaks along thin laminae (plates) or parallel layering or bedding less than one centimeter in thickness, called "fissility" (~splitting). Mudstones, on the other hand, are similar, though they do not show the tendency to split (fissility).
Shales and mudrocks contain roughly 95 percent of the organic matter in all sedimentary rocks. However, this amounts to less than one percent by mass in an average shale. Black shales form in anoxic (without oxygen) conditions. They contain free carbon and iron sulfides such as pyrite. This produces the black colouration.
Formation of shale.
Shales are typically deposited in very slow moving water and are often found in lakes and lagoonal deposits, in river deltas, on floodplains and offshore from beach sands. They can also be deposited on the continental shelf, in relatively deep, quiet water. This process could have taken millions of years to complete.
'Black shales' are dark, and are especially rich in unoxidized carbon. Black shales are deposited in anoxic or low oxygen environments, such as in stagnant water. They are common in some Palaeozoic and Mesozoic strata. Some black shales have heavy metals such as molybdenum, uranium. vanadium, and zinc. The heavy metals may have got there by slow accumulation.

Organic farms grow foods without using man-made chemicals. They do not use pesticides or herbicides which can harm the environment or wildlife.
Differences from Regular Farming.
Organic farmers usually use animal manure respectively organic substances rather than man-made chemical fertilizers which add extra nutrients to the soil. Organic foods are unique to the way other products are produced as chemically treated food can cause a lot of harm to the environment by decreasing the quality of soil and increasing energy use, carbon emissions, pesticides, and nitrate pollution. Also, the used chemicals can cause severe damage to human cells and long-term consumption can cause diseases like colon cancer (colorectal cancer), decrease fertility and take impact on the brain development of unborn children.
Organic farming maintains soil health the cropping system of organic farming keeps insects, pests, and weeds under check. Even farm waste is recycled in organic farming and it prevents the pollution of any component of our environment.
Forms of Organic Farming.
Organic farming finds usage for animal welfare, as livestock is bred with solely organic fodder. There are animal farms that are exclusively built for organic farming and are only distributing organic meat. In the recent past, many of those regional farms are using online shops for distribution like "Das Gute Fleisch " (which means "the good meat") from Germany. Therefore a wider audience has comfortable access to organic meat whereas the demand for organic meat is rapidly growing.
Flower growers and ordinary home gardens can use organic methods too. An example of organic farming which is often used in the garden is biological control. Biological control means using natural methods to get rid of pests, instead of using poisons. For example by encouraging Ladybirds (ladybugs) into the garden as they eat aphids (greenflies).
Organic Labels.
There are certain organizations per country that regulate the standards for organic farming. In the USA e.g. the USDA is distributing official "USDA Organic Labels" for products that fulfill the criteria of the organization to accept them as organic food.
Other than the US versions which differ in a "100 % organic label" and labels that state that the products are not fully organic, there is only one organic label for the EU that covers similar criteria as the "100 % label". Therefore it's harder to get organic farming certified in the EU.
There are also non-official labels by private companies that are rating products or using similar criteria to categorize organic farms. They commonly have a high reputation so customers can rely on their rating.
Benefits of Organic Cultivation.
Organic Farming has many benefits. One of the main benefits of this farming is that it promotes soil health. Farmers use techniques such as crop rotation and cover cropping to build soil fertility and reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers.
Another benefit of organic cultivation is that it promotes biodiversity. Farmers use a variety of crops and livestock breeds, and they often include wildflowers and other plants in their fields to provide habitats for beneficial insects and other wildlife. They also avoid the use of synthetic pesticides, which can harm beneficial insects and other wildlife, and instead rely on natural pest control methods.
They also avoid the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, which can contribute to water pollution and climate change. They also make use of renewable resources, such as solar power and wind energy.
Organic products are also more nutritious than conventionally grown products. Chemical-free foods are often more flavorful than conventionally grown foods because they are grown with the aim of conserving the soil and improving the health of the soil.
This leads to the plants absorbing more nutrients, leading to more nutritious foods.

ChessBase GmbH is a German company that markets chess software. It also has a chess news website, and uses a server for online chess. Set up in 1998, it builds and sells large databases, with up to three million games, classified in various ways. A smaller fraction have notes, about 60,000 at present. It is possible to connect the database with one or more "chess engines" which calculate likely good moves. Databases organize data from past games; engines do calculations and use look-up tables for standard information, having, for example, answers to special endgame problems.p400-406

The Three-sector hypothesis is a large-scale economic type theory. It says that there are three kinds of economic activities, which are very different from each other:
These kinds of activities are called economic sectors. The theory speaks about the primary, secondary, and tertiary sector. The theory was developed by Alan Fisher, Colin Clark and Jean Fourastié in the 1930s. Clark used a speech given by Sir William Petty, in 1690. For this reason the theory is also known as Petty's Law. The first sector is about directly using natural resources, the second sector is about processing these resources to obtain "higher level" goods.
The theory also says that the main focus of the economy of a country will change, from the primary to the secondary, and from the secondary to the tertiary sector, as economic development progresses.

Piss Christ is a 1987 photo that was taken by Andres Serrano. The picture is of a small plastic crucifix that is in a glass of Serrano's urine. The piece won the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art's "Awards in the Visual Arts" competition. This contest gets some of its money from the National Endowment from the Arts, a United States government group that gives money to art projects.
Controversy.
The photo caused some dispute when it was first shown in 1989. Some people who were against the photo, including United States Senators Al D'Amanto and Jesse Helms were upset that Serrano was given $15,000 for the work. They were also upset that part of it was from the National Endowment for the Arts. Supporters of the work said the "Piss Christ" is an issue of artistic freedom and freedom of speech.
Others said that the government paying for "Piss Christ" went against separation of church and state.
Sister Wendy Beckett, an art critic and Catholic nun, said in a television interview with Bill Moyers that she did not think the work was blasphemous. She thought that it was but a statement on "what we have done to Christ"
During a showing of Serrano's works at the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) in 1997, then Archbishop George Pelli tried to get the Supreme Court of Victoria to stop the gallery from showing the work. The Court did not agree with him and did not stop it. A few days later, one visitor tried to take the work off of the gallery wall, and two teenagers later attacked the work with a hammer. The director of the NGV then cancelled the show. He said that he was worried about some of Rembrandt's works that were also being shown at the time.
"Piss Christ" was part of the BBC documentary called "Why Beauty Matters", which talks about art and how it is important in everyday life.

MSNBC is an American cable news channel started by NBCUniversal (NBC) and Microsoft (MSN), thus the name MSNBC. It was started in 1996. It is produced by NBC's news division, NBC News. It replaced a channel Roger Ailes operated and founded for NBC called America's Talking, which launched in 1994.
Shows.
Most of its shows are shows that talk about news and politics, and are hosted by people such as Joy Reid, Rachel Maddow, Chris Hayes and Lawrence O’Donnell. There have been accusations of liberal bias made about MSNBC. MSNBC's motto is "Lean Forward", suggesting a progressive political stance.

Leon H. "Bud" Carson ( – ) was an American football coach best known for working with the Pittsburgh Steelers' championship teams of the 1970s.
Player.
Carson played defensive back for North Carolina from 1949 to 1951, then entered the Marines.
Coach.
Georgia Tech.
After he left the Marines, he went into coaching. He worked at Georgia Tech for head coach Bobby Dodd. Carson took over as head coach in 1967. Under Carson, the Yellow Jackets had three 4-6 seasons in a row before going 9-3 and winning the Sun Bowl in 1970. In 1971, Tech finished 6-6 after a Peach Bowl loss. He was fired by Georgia Tech after that season. While at Georgia Tech, he made the "Cover 2" defensive strategy that has been widely used by the NFL.
NFL.
Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Chuck Noll hired Carson as defensive coordinator in 1972. Under Carson, the "Steel Curtain" developed as one of the best defenses in National Football League history. The defense, led by Jack Lambert, Mel Blount, Jack Ham and Mean Joe Greene, gave up fewer points than any other American Football Conference team in Pittsburgh's Super Bowl seasons of 1974 and 1975. In 1976, the team gave up fewer than 10 points a game.
After the 1977 season, Carson took over the defensive-coordinator job with the Los Angeles Rams, who lost to the Steelers in Super Bowl XIV. He later worked as a coach for the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Colts. He then was in charge of the New York Jets' defense from 1985 to 1988. In 1989, he was hired as the head coach of the Cleveland Browns.
Cleveland won the AFC Central Division in 1989 before losing to the Denver Broncos in the conference championship for the third time in four years. Browns owner Art Modell fired Carson halfway through the 1990 season, which ended with a 3-13 record. Carson then worked as a coach for the Philadelphia Eagles and the St. Louis Rams before retiring in 1997.
Family.
Carson, a long-time smoker, died in 2005 of emphysema. He was married to Linda Carson, an anchorwoman at Sarasota television station WWSB. His daughter Cathi Carson is the sports reporter at two Jacksonville stations in Jacksonville WTEV and WAWS and was formerly a reporter at WWSB. He also had a son, Cliff, and a daughter, Dana, as well as a stepson, Gary Ford.

Herman M. Hickman (October 1, 1911 - April 25, 1958) was a Hall of Fame college football player for the University of Tennessee, and played for the NFL's Brooklyn Dodgers. He later coached football and was a professional wrestler.
Playing career.
Hickman came to the University of Tennessee from Johnson City, Tennessee. Hickman was a guard for the Tennessee Volunteers football team from 1929–1931. He was chosen for Grantland Rice's All American football team in 1931. Hickman was also named to the All-Southern team in 1931 with teammate Gene McEver. Coach Robert Neyland held Hickman in high regard. "When one (football writer) said Hickman was 'the best guard the South ever produced,' Coach General Bob Neyland snarled, 'Herman Hickman is the greatest guard football has ever known.'"
Following his time at Tennessee, Hickman played for the NFL's Brooklyn Dodgers from 1932 to 1934. He was named an All Pro at left guard in 1933.&lt; name=bio/&gt; He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1959.
Coaching career.
Hickman was an assistant at Wake Forest, North Carolina State and West Point before earning the head coaching job at Yale University in 1948. He led the Bulldogs to a 16-17-2 record before resigning in 1951.

Hickman also was a professional wrestler, known as "The Tennessee Terror." He wrestled in over 500 matches.

Butterflyfish are a group of brightly marked tropical marine fish in the family Chaetodontidae. The bannerfish and coralfish are also included in this group. They live mostly on the reefs of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. There are about 120 species in 10 genera.

Viktor Korchnoi (23 March 1931 – 6 June 2016) was a professional chess grandmaster. He was born in Leningrad, USSR (Saint Petersburg). In 1976 he defected to the Netherlands. He lived in Switzerland for many years, and became a Swiss citizen. Towards the end of his life, he was the oldest active grandmaster on the regular tournament circuit. Viktor was at or near the top in chess for half a century.
In all, Korchnoi was a candidate for the World Championship on ten occasions (1962, 1968, 1971, 1974, 1977, 1980, 1983, 1985, 1988 and 1991). Korchnoi was also a four-time USSR chess champion, a five-time member of Soviet teams that won the European championship, and a six-time member of Soviet teams that won the Chess Olympiad.
Matches against Karpov.
Korchnoi played three matches against Anatoly Karpov, the latter two for the World Chess Championship. In 1974, he lost the Candidates final to Karpov by the narrowest margin: 11.5–12.5. Karpov was declared world champion in 1975 when Bobby Fischer failed to defend his title. Then, after defecting from the Soviet Union in 1976, Korchnoi won two Candidates cycles to qualify for World Championship matches with Karpov in 1978 and 1981.
1978 match.
The 1978 Karpov–Korchnoi World Championship match was held in Baguio, Philippines. It was one of those events where the struggle took place off as well as on the board. Korchnoi's status as a defector and stateless person was exploited to the full by the Soviet delegation. Karpov's team was a dozen strong, and only three of them were chess players. They included Dr Zukhar, Karpov's personal psychiatrist/psychologist, whom (it was claimed) attempted to hypnotise Korchnoi during play.
There was constant controversy off the board, with X-raying of chairs, protests about the flags used on the board, hypnotism complaints and the mirror glasses used by Korchnoi. When Karpov's team sent him a blueberry yogurt during a game without any request for one by Karpov, the Korchnoi team protested, claiming it could be some kind of code. They later said this was intended as a parody of earlier protests, but it was taken seriously at the time. The story of these off-the-board struggles has been reported in detail, from the Korchnoi point of view.

Telecommunication (from two words, "tele" meaning 'from far distances' and "communication" meaning to share information) is the assisted transmission of signals over a distance for the purpose of communication. In earlier times, this may have involved the use of smoke signals, drums, semaphore, flags, or a mirror to flash sunlight. Starting with the telegraph, telecommunication typically involves the use of electronic transmitters such as the telephone, television, radio, optical fiber and computer.

Mastering is the process of moving audio from recording device to the storage device. All copies after that are made from the master copy. Master recordings (usually called just "masters") can be made on discs, tapes, and computer data storage formats.
A multitrack master is an original multitrack recording, which may be worked on over time. This may have four, eight, sixteen or more tracks. This kind of recording cannot be played on an ordinary machine, and needs a special machine to be played or recorded.
Multitrack recordings are mixed when they are finished, into a mono (monaural), stereo, or Surround Sound recording. This is called a mixed master. Copies of the mixed master can be played on an ordinary machine.
Master recordings are often valuable, especially if the recording artist is popular. Most masters are owned by record companies, but many artists and bands own their own master recordings, or are able to buy them later.
Recordings are sometimes remastered, to copy them to another format, or to make them sound better. Digital recording allows for older analog recordings to be "cleaned up", and preserved.

Stegodon is a genus of extinct elephant. They lived from the late Miocene to the late Pleistocene.
Fossils are found in Asian and African strata dating from the late Miocene. They lived in large parts of Asia, East and Central Africa and North America during the Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs. 
Some "Stegodon" species were among the largest of all elephants. Some adults were 13 feet (4 m) high at the shoulder and 26 feet (8 m) long, not including 10 feet (3m) long nearly straight tusks. A few were much smaller, living on islands.
Browser rather than grazer.
The teeth of "Stegodon" show that it was mainly a browser. As time passed, grassland increasingly took the place of forests, and browsers were at something of a disadvantage. No doubt, they were also hunted by early man.

Birch bark or birchbark is usually the bark of the paper birch tree or sometimes of similar trees such as gray (wire) birch.
Birch bark is useful because it is strong and water-resistant. It is similar in some ways to cardboard. And can be easily cut, bent and sewn. Because of this it has been very valuable for building, crafting, and writing material ever since ancient times. Birch bark also contains substances that are used in medicines and chemicals.
Uses.
Birch bark was valuable throughout the world where birch trees were available:
Birch bark is can also be used as a tinder. It is very good tinder as the inner layers will stay dry even through heavy rainstorms. To make birch bark useless as tinder, it must be soaked in water for a very long time.

The University of Bologna is the oldest university in the world in continuous operation. It was founded in Bologna, Italy in about 1088.
The university received a charter from Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158. In the 19th century, a committee of historians traced the founding of the University back to 1088. If so, it is the oldest continuous university in the world. That is slightly earlier than the University of Oxford, where there is evidence of teaching in 1096.
Bologna was also the first to use the term "universitas" for the corporation of students and masters which make up a university.
History.
In the Middle Ages, the University of Bologna was famous in all Europe for its schools of humanities and law.
The poets Dante and Petrarca studied at this university. Called officially "Alma mater studiorum", the university is an institution for students of both sexes, supported by the state. It offers courses in arts, law, medicine, pharmacy, mathematics, engineering, agronomy, veterinary medicine and pedagogy. The Italian semiologist and writer Umberto Eco was the Chair of semiotics at the university. The former prime minister of Italy, Romano Prodi, is a professor in the Department of Economics.

An electronic cigarette (or e-cigarette, e-cig), also known as a vape, is a cigarette substitute. It gives small amounts of the chemical nicotine without the tobacco or other chemicals from real cigarettes. 
The main substances making up in the liquid in the e-cigarettes are nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerin and some flavors or smells. Using an e-cigarette is known as "vaping".
Function.
An E-cigarette is made of 3 parts:
The e-liquid (propylene glycol and/or glycerin) is heated to make a vapour which looks like the smoke from real cigarettes. This caries the nicotine to the lungs where it is absorbed.
As of 2015, 3 generations of "electonic cigarettes" are known:
History.
The modern electronic cigarette was invented by Hon Lik (regarded as the 'father of the electronic cigarette'), a Chinese pharmacist and inventor. Hon had himself quit smoking, after his father, also a heavy smoker, had died of lung cancer. Hon patented the modern e-cigarette design in 2003, and starting selling it domestically. Many versions made their way to the U.S., sold mostly over the Internet by small marketing firms.
However, many US and Chinese e-cig manufacturers copied his designs illegally, and as a result Hon Lik did not get the expected financial rewards for his invention (although some US manufacturers have recompensated him through out of court settlements).
In 2008, this attracted the attention of the World Health Organization ("WHO") who said that these e-cigarettes were not proper nicotine replacement therapy and that this mis-information had to be taken away from any sites or advertisements saying that they were.
Starting 2012 Tobacco companies also want a piece of E-Cigarette-cake and work on their own products. Marlboro goes for heating tobacco, Philip Morris tests a fizz-like method while British American Tobacco tries a medical-like inhaler. Many big tobacco companies didn't do their own research or stopped at some point. Instead they bought smaller e-cig companies to enter the market.
E-Liquid.
These devices have a battery powered heating element and tank that contains a liquid solution made by combining nicotine, vegetable glycol or propylene glycol and flavorings. The gadget that can be bought in a variety of shapes and sizes usually resembles a pen or a regular cigarette, and it works like a vaporizer. The liquid used in e-cigs is commonly made of propylene glycol, glycerin, distilled water, artificial (fake) flavors and optionally nicotine. It often tastes like tobacco, fruit, mint/menthol or sweets.
In 2017, the TRPR (Tobacco and Related Products Regulations), which was a revised interpretation of the EU Commission's TPD (Tobacco Products Directive), came into effect in the UK. This piece of legislation aimed to ensure the safety of vape products include vape kits and included the limitations of nicotine-containing e-liquid bottles to 10ml, vape tank sizes to 2ml as well as nicotine strength of e-liquid to a maximum of 20mg. Current UK laws state the sale of e-cigarettes and e-liquids is legal to over 18s only, but many shops allow minors over the age of 12 to purchase nicotine-free e-liquid as all the ingredients in it are safe compared to nicotine e-liquid. Technically it is illegal for a minor to purchase any vaping products or any items associated with e-cigarettes but it is perfectly legal for a minor to use an e-cigarette, nicotine or nicotine-free. These are UK laws only.
Legal History.
Many countries are not approving electronic cigarettes as a less harmful alternative to traditional cigarettes. 
The sale of tobacco cigarettes with flavor (except menthol) has been stopped in some countries but not yet in Europe or the USA. 
The EU is testing if the product is bad to the health and safety of persons in general. They are also researching if electronic cigarettes can be called a medical product. In 2009 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was provided authority by Congress to ban all sales of cigarettes with flavors, except menthol.
Because many countries are not sure if electronic cigarettes are a medical product, each country has their own opinion and rules on e-cigarettes.
Health institutions are more and more interested in E-cigarettes because they are much cheaper than smoking regular ones, making them popular alternative. In the United States of America, individual states have different rules on use and sale of electronic cigarettes.
Apart from medical reasons e-cigarettes have also been banned in airport and other high population-density public places due to a number of incidents where they have been a cause of fire.
The United Kingdom are one of few countries to have government support for electronic cigarettes and e-liquids. Specifically, the NHS recommend e-cigarettes as a less harmful alternative to smoking
In Australia vapes are legal but is publicly recommended not to use electronic cigarettes. Such advertisements are "vape truths" also known as "puff or pass" which is displayed on advertisements on social media platforms and public broadcasting television. Western Australia has no laws limiting the sale of vapes to underage minors, and nicotine laws regarding vape pens. 
New Zealand has a Vaping Regulatory Authority to manage the sale of electronic cigarettes.

The Silmarillion is a book written by J. R. R. Tolkien. It was first published posthumously (after Tolkien was dead) in 1977, edited by his son Christopher Tolkien. "The Silmarillion" is set in Tolkien's world Middle-earth, and is about its early history before "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings". 
The name "Silmarillion" can mean the published book (as in "The Silmarillion"), but it can also mean all the stories from the First Age of Middle-earth (the "Quenta Silmarillion").
Overview.

The Mail on Sunday is a British newspaper. Over six million people read it every week. It was first published in 1982 by Lord Northcliffe. It sells the second biggest amount of Sunday newspapers in Britain after"The News of the World". The Daily Mail was launched nearly a century before(1896) and is The Mail on Sunday's "sister paper".
They are both owned by Associated Newspapers, but the editorial staff are completely separate.
History.
"The Mail on Sunday" was first launched on 2 May 1982, to go with the "Daily Mail". The first story ever printed on the front page was the "RAF's bombing of Port Stanley airport in the Falklands". The Daily Mail and General Trust(DMGT)came up with some tough targets for the paper to reach. Initially DMGT wanted to sell 1.25 million copies a week. But the launch of The Mail on Sunday was not a success. After six weeks, sales were only around 700,000 copies.
Lord Rothermere then brought in the "Daily Mail"'s editor David English (later Sir David). He helped redesign and re-launch The Mail on Sunday. In the first three and a half months, Sir David managed to stop the fall in sales. The circulation then increased to 840,000. Three new sections were introduced:
Today (2008)the circulation is around 2.3 million, an increase of more than 1.5 million.
The newspaper's reputation developed thanks to Stewart Steven. Its circulation grew from around 1 million to almost 2 million during his time in charge. The editor who followed him was Jonathan Holborow and the current editor is Peter Wright.

The African wild dog or painted dog ("Lycaon pictus") is a carnivorous mammal of the Canidae family. In past centuries it had a wide distribution in Africa.
The African wild dog is very social, living in packs. They hunt antelopes, which they catch by chasing them to exhaustion. Like other canids, the African wild dog regurgitates food for its young, and other adults. Their natural enemies are lions and hyenas: the lions kill the canids where possible; hyenas frequently steal their kills.

The People's Choice Awards is an awards show recognizing the people and the work of popular culture. The show has been held every year since 1975 and is voted on by regular people. The People's Choice Awards air on CBS and are produced by Procter &amp; Gamble and Mark Burnett. Global promotion is handled by Kroszover Entertainment.
The award show's creator, Bob Stivers, made the first show in 1975. The first awards recognized "The Sting" as 1974's Favorite Picture, Barbra Streisand as the year's Favorite Film Actress, and John Wayne as its Favorite Film Actor. Ratings for the show peaked in 1977, when the 3rd People's Choice Awards attracted 35.3 million viewers who saw Farrah Fawcett-Majors win for Favorite Female TV Star, "" win as the Favorite Picture, and Streisand and Wayne win again in the Film Actress and Actor categories.
Procter &amp; Gamble, the show's first and only sponsor, bought the show from Stivers in 1982.
In 2008, the "People's Choice Awards" introduced a new category: Favorite Sci-Fi Show. The nominees were "Stargate Atlantis", "Battlestar Galactica", and "Doctor Who". The winner was "Stargate Atlantis." 
Categories.
The award categories have changed over the years. For example, the 16th People's Choice Awards had categories including Favorite All-Around Movie ("Batman"), and both a Favorite Movie Actor (Tom Cruise) and a World Favorite Movie Actor (Dustin Hoffman). At the 23rd People's Choice Awards, Rob Reiner was named the People's Choice Awards Honoree. More recently, the 32nd People's Choice Awards (shown in January 2006) included categories such as Favorite On-Screen Match-Up (Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in "Wedding Crashers"), Favorite Leading Lady (Reese Witherspoon), Favorite Tour (U2), and an award named after a Procter &amp; Gamble brand: Nice 'n Easy Fans Favorite Hair (Faith Hill).
Poll-based awards.
In the 20th century, the awards were based on results from Gallup polls. Each year, Gallup took a survey of different categories for favorite actor, actress, movie, artist, television show or group. There was no limit on who or what could be chosen. The public could choose whomever or whatever it liked. The results of the annual survey were announced in the form of the "People's Choice Awards".
Since polls have margins of error, many years' awards have had ties in at least one category, when Gallup declared that the voting was so close that a single winner could not be chosen. For example, in 2003, both "Spider-Man" and "" were recognized as Favorite Motion Picture.
Switch to online voting.
The winners of the 31st People's Choice Awards (shown January 9, 2005) were decided by online voting rather than Gallup polls. The nominees submitted for Internet voting were picked using an unpublished process involving editors at "Entertainment Weekly", the show's production team, and a group of pop culture fans.
The nominees for the 32nd People's Choice Awards were picked by web research company Knowledge Networks, which took what it described as a nationally representative sample of men and women ages 18 to 54, with and without Internet access, to come up with the nominees after being presented with a list of candidates determined by national ratings averages, box office grosses and album sales, and they had the option to write in their favorites. Knowledge Networks picks these people by calling them and gives a Web TV and Internet access to people without Internet access so they can see what other people think.
The nominees for the 2010 People's Choice Awards were determined by media research company Visible Measures, which specializes in measuring Internet Video audience behavior. They used a program called True Reach to find out people's reactions to online videos.
Kids' Choice Awards.
In 1988, Nickelodeon created the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, a children's version of the People's Choice Awards. Though they have similar names, the two shows are owned by different companies. Also similar but unrelated is the Teen Choice Awards.

"It's Been Awhile" is a song by American alternative metal band Staind. The song was released in March 20, 2001. It was the first single on their third studio album "Break the Cycle".
On the "Billboard" charts, "It's Been Awhile" was able to peak at #5 on Hot 100, #1 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, #1 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, #3 on the Top 40 Mainstream, #6 on the Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks, and at #4 on the Top 40 Tracks charts.

Hysteria is when someone has a very strong emotion that is unmanageable. Often, this means a very strong sense of fear. When someone has hysteria, it is called "hysterics". Hysteria could be caused by traumatic events in a person's life.
Today, many psychiatrists and other doctors do not use the word "hysteria" for a patient. They use other words that have the same meaning. Some of the words they may use are "psychosomatic", "functional", "nonorganic", "psychogenic", or "medically unexplained".
One of the conditions of hysteria may be Histrionic personality disorder.

Polarization (also polarisation) is a property of transverse waves. Some waves have motion in another direction as well as the direction of the wave. In water, for instance, the wave will move across the water, but the wave will also move water up and down on the surface. Light waves are similarly transverse waves though they are also particles. Sound waves do not have polarization, since they are longitudinal waves. Polarized sunglasses take advantage of these oscillations.
Light.
Light reflected by shiny transparent materials is partly or fully polarized, except when the light is perpendicular to the surface. Polarization was first discovered in 1808 by the mathematician . A polarizing filter, such as a pair of polarizing sunglasses, can be used to observe this effect by rotating the filter while looking through it at the reflection off of a distant horizontal surface. At certain rotation angles, the reflected light will be reduced or eliminated. Polarizing filters remove light polarized at 90° to the filter's polarization axis. If two polarizers are placed atop one another at 90° angles to one another, very little light can pass through both.
Polarization by scattering is observed as light passes through the atmosphere. The scattered light produces the brightness and color in clear skies. This partial polarization of scattered light can be used to darken the sky in photographs, increasing the contrast. This effect is easiest to observe at sunset, on the horizon at a 90° angle from the setting sun. Another easily observed effect is the drastic reduction in brightness of images of the sky and clouds reflected from horizontal surfaces. This is why polarizing filters are often used in sunglasses. Polarizing sunglasses also show rainbow-like patterns caused by color-dependent birefringent effects, for example in toughened glass (e.g., car windows) or items made from transparent plastics. The role played by polarization in the operation of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) is also frequently apparent to the wearer of polarizing sunglasses, which may reduce the contrast or even make the display unreadable.
Polarization filter.
Polarization of light is useful, after it has been filtered. A filter will separate light with one type of polarization from other types. Most daylight, or light from a light bulb, has a mix of polarizations (lasers are an exception). The filter works much like trying to put a playing card through a comb - only if the card is turned the right direction will it fit. Light that is turned a different way will be blocked by the filter. Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) use this to block light to make letters or numbers on a display. Glasses that have different polarization filters for each eye can separate light meant for the left eye and for the right eye. This is a common way to make 3D movies and 3D television.
In nature sometimes light that bounces off of a surface has the same polarization - this is called 'glare' from a window or water. A polarization filter on a camera will remove this glare to help see through the window or water (or can increase the glare, depending on how it is turned).
The photograph on the right was taken through polarizing sunglasses and through the rear window of a car. Light from the sky is reflected by the windshield of the other car at an angle, making it mostly horizontally polarized. The rear window is made of tempered glass. Stress from heat treatment of the glass alters the polarization of light passing through it, like a wave plate. Without this effect, the sunglasses would block the horizontally polarized light reflected from the other car's window. The stress in the rear window, however, changes some of the horizontally polarized light into vertically polarized light that can pass through the glasses. As a result, the regular pattern of the heat treatment becomes visible.
Electromagnetic.
Other electromagnetic waves also have polarization, but it can happen in different ways.
General polarization: Some waves can be described by having the electric field perpendicular to the direction of the wave, and these are called TE (transverse electric) waves. Others have the magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of the wave, and these are called TM (transverse magnetic) waves. These are the most general types of wave polarization. They can also be called vertical or horizontal polarized waves. If both the electric field and magnetic field are perpendicular to the direction of the wave, the wave is called TEM (transverse electromagnetic). Linear, circular, and elliptical polarizations are specific cases of TEM polarization.
Linear, circular, and elliptical polarizations are three specific types of TEM polarization. They cannot be measured close to an antenna. Far away from an antenna the fields are TEM, so these can be used. They are easy to imagine if you look from at the wave straight on.

"Now!" series in other countries.
More recently, there have been numerous different versions of the brand in other parts of the world, including:
Although there is some overlap in content between current releases in different markets, there are also differences such as the inclusion of local hits, and (for example) the single-CD format of the U.S. releases, in contrast with the traditional double-album UK format.

Personal space is a concept on psychology and sociology. The concept talks about two people (the "actors"). They have space around them. The closer they are to each other emotionally, the closer an actor will be able to stand to the other, without being intrusive. The concept was introduced by Edward T. Hall in 1966. 
Discomfort results if one actor steps into the personal space of the other, without this being desired. The amount of space a being needs can be classified in two categories:
Hall's spacing models were based on Heini Hediger's 1955 psychological studies of zoo animals.

The London Gazette is one of the official records of the British government, and one of the most important in the UK. The "London Gazette" claims to be the oldest surviving English newspaper. It was first published on 7 November 1665. It is not a normal newspaper with typical news stories. The "London Gazette" is still published each weekday, except for Bank Holidays. The Gazette is being put online and records between the years 1752–1998 are online.
History.
The "London Gazette" was first published as the "Oxford Gazette" on 7 November 1665. Charles II and the Royal Court had moved to Oxford to escape the Great Plague of London, and courtiers were unwilling to touch, let alone read, London newspapers for fear of becoming ill. When the King returned to London after the end of the plague the "Gazette" moved too. The first issue of the "London Gazette" (labelled No. 24) was published on 5 February 1666. The "Gazette" was not a newspaper in the modern sense: it was sent in manuscript by post to subscribers. It was not printed for sale to the general public.
Traditions.
In time of war, dispatches from the various conflicts are published in the "London Gazette". People referred to are said to have been mentioned in despatches. When members of the armed forces are promoted, and these promotions are published here, the person is said to have been “gazetted”.
Being "gazetted" (or "in the gazette") sometimes also meant becoming bankrupt. Notices of engagement and marriage also used to be published in the "Gazette".

The chinese remainder theorem is a theorem from number theory. It is about congruence. The original form was:
The theorem says that there will be a solution to this question if there's no common factor between the row sizes. Using the original example, that is that no number divides both 3 and 7, both 3 and 5, nor both 5 and 7 (except, of course, 1). They're all coprime.
The Chinese remainder theorem is used in cryptography. For example, for the RSA algorithm.

In music, a riff is an ostinato; a repeated set of notes, pattern, or melody, often played by rhythmic instruments. The riff is the base of the musical composition. They are most common in rock music, funk, and jazz.
Some of famous riffs in rock music can be found in the following songs:

Portland Bill is a peninsula off the south coast of England. It has strong tidal currents. The nearby town of Weymouth was a sailing venue for London 2012.
The Bill is a narrow promontory at the southern end of the Isle of Portland. It is the southernmost point of Dorset, England. One of Portland's most popular destinations is the Portland Bill Lighthouse.

The Onager ("Equus hemionus") is a large mammal belonging to the Equidae family. It is native to the deserts of Syria, Iran, Pakistan, Kashmir, Israel and Palestine, and western China. It is sometimes known as the Asian Wild Ass.

Pilot whales are two species of oceanic dolphins, whose scientific name is Globicephala. The two types of pilot whales are the long-finned pilot whale and the short-finned pilot whale. Their behaviour resembles that of the larger whales more than that of dolphins. 
The two look similar at sea and are usually just known simply as pilot whales or "calderón" in Spanish. They and other large dolphins are also known as blackfish.
Pilot whales can be found nearly worldwide. The long-finned variety prefers colder waters, for example near Antarctica. The short-finned ones can also be found in tropical waters. Pilot whales are highly social animals, they live in groups of 20-30 animals, called "pods". Larger groups of over 100 pilot whales have been observed. Studies suggest that the young remain in the same pod as their parents, which is unusual for mammals. Female short-finned pilot whales go through menopause. Females that no longer reproduce contribute to the survival of the young.
For reasons which are unknown, pilot whales seem to end up stranded on a beach fairly often. 

The Persian jird ("Meriones persicus") is a species of rodent in the Muridae family. It is found in Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Turkey, and Turkmenistan.
The Persian jird is about 6 inches long. It has a brush-tipped tail that is slightly longer than the body. They are wild brown with white bellies. 
They live in dry rocky hillsides with little plant life and semi-desert areas. The eat dry plant material and grains, and sometimes small insects.
Persian jirds usually have two litters a year. Each litter has around seven pups.
Some people keep them as a pet. They can live to be six or seven years old. They need large cages that let them climb and leap.

Donald LaFontaine (August 26, 1940 – September 1, 2008) was an American voice actor. He had a deep voice. He recorded many movie trailers and television advertisements. He used the well known phrase "in a world...", which has been used in movie trailers many times.

A flamethrower is a device used to shoot fire. They have been used by the military since the days of Greek fire. Most modern military flamethrowers project flaming liquids. 
Flamethrowers became rare in the 19th century, due to improvements in other weapons. Trench warfare made them more useful again, and the German army began using them in 1915. Flamethrowers were used during World War 2 as a bunker clearing device. Many Axis troops used pillboxes and other small fortifications in Northern France, Germany, and on Pacific Ocean islands. Small fire squads used these weapons to draw them out. Although flamethrowers project flames, burning was not the most common form of death associated with these weapons. Rather, smoke released as a byproduct of combustion presented soldiers with the grim ultimatum between death by smoke inhalation or leaving the trench and facing enemy gunfire.
Due to advancements in ballistic technologies and modern warfare tactics, flamethrowers are much less common in modern theatres. Presently, these weapons have been converted for civilian use for clearing old crops, domestic defense and even landscaping. In 2018, the Boring Company headed by Elon Musk developed a civilian flamethrower in a limited production of 20,000 units. With the prominence of Musk in contemporary culture, these flamethrowers were sold quickly yielding 10 million dollars for the Boring Company in gross revenue.

Confetti are small pieces of paper or other material that is thrown into the air at a celebration such as party or a wedding. Confetti comes in a variety of colors and shapes.
In some places including Europe, the use of confetti is banned due to health problems of people, animals or the earth, or due to the work needed to clean up the confetti afterward. Foil and plastic confetti are not biodegradable. Some cans are illegal due to banned items in them.
The first known use of confetti was in 1815, as the Italian word "confetto" meaning "sweetmeat".

The Poaceae or Gramineae are the "true" grasses. They are a large family of monocot flowering plants. There are about 12,000 species and 780 genera. They are one of most ecologically and economically important of all plant families. Rushes and sedges fall outside this family, but they are related.
Grasslands are about 20% of the vegetation cover of the Earth. Poaceae also live in many other habitats, including wetlands, forests, and tundra. Bamboos are part of this huge family of plants.
Domesticated poaceous cereal crops (maize (corn), wheat, millets, and rice) are eaten around the world. The Poaceae are the most economically important plant family in modern times. They are used for forage, building materials (bamboo, thatch) and fuel (ethanol), as well as food.
Grasses include some of the most useful plant life-forms. They became widespread towards the end of the Cretaceous period. Fossilized dinosaur dung (coprolites) have been found with phytoliths of grasses which are related to rice and bamboo. Grasses have adapted to conditions in lush rain forests, dry deserts, cold mountains and even intertidal habitats. They are at present the most widespread plant type. Grass is a valuable source of food and energy for wildlife as well as humans.

The Medes were an ancient Iranian people and one of the ancestors of modern Kurdish people who lived in the northwestern portions of present-day Iran. This area was known in Greek as Media or Medea They entered this region with the first wave of Iranian tribes, in the late second millennium BC (at the end of the Bronze Age).
By the 6th century BC, the Medes were able to make their own empire. It stretched from southern shore of the Black Sea and Aran province (in modern Azerbaijan) to north and central Asia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.
The Medes are credited with the foundation of the first Iranian empire, the largest of its day until Cyrus the Great established a unified Iranian empire of the Medes and Persians, often referred to as the Achaemenid Empire.
Controversy.
Modern scholars question whether a Median empire even existed. It is argued that even if it existed, it must have been just a "political alliance" among highland neighbors of the Assyrians. The alliance might include Armenia in southeastern Anatolia, Sagartians in modern northern Iraq, and the actual Medians in the area between what is today Hamadan-Kirmanshah in cental Zagros. Neither cuneiform sources, archaeological evidence, or biblical accounts, support Herodotus, who claimed there really was a Median empire.
Median language.
Strabo mentions the affinity of Mede with other Iranian languages in his "Geography":
Herodotus, mentions the word "Spaka" ("Dog", still present in current Iranian languages such as tat and talysh, and different from Persian)

A headshot (or head shot) is a photograph of a person's face. It is a form of portraiture. The purpose of a headshot is to show the subject's personality, or character. Headshots are used in the modelling and acting businesses and is vital to the careers of many business and sales executives who use them on business cards, company web sites and social media sites like LinkedIn. Most actors have a headshot that they will provide to employers.
Headshots are a separate specialty career path branch for several photographers who make or have made careers in this kind of photography. Examples include Yousuf Karsh (1908-2002), Yucel Yalim (1958), Cindy Quinn (1960) and Peter Hurley. 

Mede is a comune (municipality) in the Province of Pavia in the Italian region Lombardy. It is located about 50 km southwest of Milan and about 35 km southwest of Pavia. As of 31 December 2004, it had a population of 6,993 and an area of 33.2 km2.
Mede borders the following municipalities: Frascarolo, Gambarana, Lomello, Pieve del Cairo, Sartirana Lomellina, Semiana, Torre Beretti e Castellaro, Villa Biscossi.
Population.
Here is how the population of the town has changed over the last 140 years.

The rhesus macaque ("Macaca mulatta"), often called the Rhesus monkey and Indian monkey, is one of the best known species of Old World monkeys. 
It lives in a wide area, and has an unknown but quite large population. It lives in a broad range of habitats. Native to South, Central and Southeast Asia, troops of "Macaca mulatta" inhabit a great variety of habitats from grasslands to arid and forested areas, but also close to human settlements.
Rhesus macaques are native to northern India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Afghanistan, Vietnam, southern China, and some neighboring areas. They have the widest geographic ranges of any nonhuman primate. He is also known as national mammal of Pakistan.
They are regular swimmers. Babies as young as a few days old can swim, and adults are known to swim over a half mile between islands. Rhesus macaques are noted for their tendency to move from rural to urban areas, where they rely on handouts or refuse from humans.

Foreplay is the name for a number of things people do before they have sex. These things do not need to be directly related to having sex. Rather, they are done to sexually arouse people, to make them want each other more, Examples of things that can be used in foreplay differ among people, Most people prefer simple things that make them feel nice such as a person talking softly, a compliment, a Hug, or by being Tickled by a person they like, or even sharing similar hobbies, such as white water rafting, rocky mountain climbing or even how flexible you both are at Yoga,
Not all of these acts are physical, some can also be psychological. Common things done in foreplay include kissing, touching each other, hugging, and stimulating the others erogenous zones.
Foreplay has a well-defined function - it lowers inhibitions and makes people feel better at ease.
Foreplay has been mentioned in historic works. The Ancient Indian work "Kama Sutra" mentions different types of embracing, kissing, and marking with nails and teeth. It also mentions BDSM activities such as slapping and moaning as "play."
Based on age, religious and political background, what people do as foreplay can be quite different. Many people think that women demand more foreplay and require more time to become aroused. Recent scientific research has show that this is false, though. Scientists from McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, Canada used the method of thermal imaging to record baseline temperature change in the genital area as the definition of the time necessary for sexual arousal. Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal and concluded that, on average, women and men spend almost the same time for sexual arousal — around 10 minutes.

BBC Radio 5 Live (formerly BBC Radio Five Live) is the BBC's radio station that gives live BBC News, phone-ins, and sports news. It is the main radio station for sport in the United Kingdom, covering nearly all big sports events in the UK or with British competitors in, including the Olympics and the football World Cup
It is transmitted via analogue radio on 693 and 909 kHz AM in the medium wave band. These frequencies belonged to BBC Radio 2 from November 23, 1978 to August 26, 1990. Before that they were used in some regions of the UK by the BBC Home Service and BBC Radio 4. The radio is also available on digital radio in the United Kingdom via DAB, digital satellite, IPTV, Freeview, and is also streamed online. However, because of rights restrictions, coverage of some events (especially live sporting events) is not available online. Also, some of the content available online is only for UK users.

Note that Radio 5 Live operates International and UK feeds. International feeds aren't allowed to cover certain sports events because of local radio rights to those events.

The Rough-toothed dolphin ("Steno bredanensis") is a fairly large oceanic dolphin. It can be found in deep warm and tropical waters around the world.

The striped dolphin ("Stenella coeruleoalba") is an oceanic dolphin. They live in temperate and tropical waters of all the world's oceans. 

Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry, 1st Baronet (born Bournemouth, 27 February 1848; died Rustington, near Worthing, Sussex, 7 October 1918) was an English composer. His music influenced other English composers such as Elgar and Vaughan Williams. Parry wrote a great deal of music, but by far the best known piece he wrote is the song "Jerusalem". Another piece which is often sung is the anthem "I was glad" written for the coronation of Edward VII.
His early life.
Parry was born into a rich family. He went to school in Eton and got his music degree while he was still there. He then went to Oxford to study. He learned from the English-born composer Henry Hugo Pierson in Stuttgart, and with William Sterndale Bennett and the pianist Edward Dannreuther in London. He started to compose a lot of chamber music which was first performed at Dannreuther’s house. He became famous in 1880 when Dannreuther played his piano concerto and his choral work "Prometheus Unbound" was performed at the Gloucester Festival. Other choirs started to ask him to write music for them. One of his best choral pieces was the ode "Blest Pair of Sirens" (1887). Other choral works include "Ode on Saint Cecilia's Day" (1889), the oratorios "Judith" (1888) and "Job" (1892). “Judith” includes a tune which became a well-loved hymn tune called “Repton” sung in churches to the words “Dear Lord and Father of Mankind”.
His orchestral works from this period include four symphonies, a set of Symphonic Variations in E minor, the "Overture to an Unwritten Tragedy" (1893) and the "Elegy for Brahms" (1897). He also wrote for the Greek play 'The Birds' by Aristophanes.
Mid career.
As Parry became more famous he got many invitations to important jobs. He started teaching at the Royal College of Music in 1884 and became its director in 1894, a post he held until his death. In 1900 he succeeded John Stainer as professor of music at Oxford University. In 1908 his doctor advised him to resign from his Oxford job.
Later years.
During the last decade of his life he wrote some of his best works, including the "Symphonic Fantasia '1912"' (also called "Symphony No. 5"), the "Ode on the Nativity" (1912), "Jerusalem" (1916) and the "Songs of Farewell" which includes the song “My Soul, there is a Country”. These were songs about the needless suffering in the war. He died of influenza in Rustington, Sussex.
His influence.
Parry had a lot of influence on English music in the 20th century. This was not just because of his music, but also through his teaching and his writings about music. The composers he liked best and who influenced his style were Bach and Brahms. His music is firmly tonal (always in clear major or minor keys), and Elgar and Vaughan Williams learned a lot from studying his music.
Parry was a man who always liked to help people, and so he took on a great deal of work, which did not do his health much good. When he had free time he enjoyed driving fast cars and sailing.
He was made a knight, and the first Baronet of Highnam in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1902.
The house in Richmond Hill, Bournemouth where he was born is marked with a blue plaque.

Bierhübeli-oder auch Sahli genannt is the name of a concert hall in the center of Berne, Switzerland. Many famous artists from all around the world have played there including Sugarhill Gang, Adam Green, Sportfreunde Stiller, Wir sind Helden, Joy Denalane and Bad Religion. 
History.
From 1729 there has been a restaurant there called "Bierhübeli". In 1847 the "Bierhübeli" restaurant burned down. After that, they decided to build a hall as well as rebuilding the restaurant. It was finished in 1912. The hall was named after the restaurant. 
Many styles of music are played there, ranging from rock and metal to rap and hip-hop. 
The stage, the walls and the floor are made of wood. There is also a bar in the hall. In the hall, the audience feels very close to the artist. The sound in the hall is very rich, because of the shape and the way the building was made.

Lyss is a municipality in the administrative district of Seeland in the Canton of Bern in Switzerland. It has a population of 11,000 people. About 84% of these people are Swiss German. Politically, Lyss can be called a city. The name "Lyss" comes from the local river Lyssbach.
On 1 January 2011, the old municipality of Busswil bei Büren was combined with Lyss.

 In Christianity, the Second Coming is a time when Jesus Christ will come back to earth. The Apostles Creed and the Nicene Creed state that "Christ will come again". This coming is to judge the living and the dead. Throughout history, there have been different ideas about the details of this event. These disagreements are related to the Millennium which is described in the Book of Revelation as a 1000 year reign of Christ on the earth. Some Christians, called Amillennialists, think the 1,000 years refers only to the eventual triumph of the Gospel. Others, called Postmillennialists think that Jesus will return physically to earth. This will happen only after Christianity has been predominant for the 1,000 years. This may be a real 1,000 years or an indefinitely long time. In recent times, many Christians, especially in the United States, have believed that there will be a Rapture of the Christians. This means that at a certain time all Christians will go up to heaven to be with Jesus. After seven years of trouble on earth, Jesus will return with all the Christians to defeat the Antichrist and rule on earth for 1,000 literal years. Others who believe in the rapture put it at in the middle or at the end of the seven years. These different views come mainly from the Book of Revelation, but other Old Testament and New Testament books are also used to develop the different views. Since the Book of Revelation uses highly symbolic language, it can be understood in different ways. What virtually all Christians agree on is that in some way, Jesus will someday destroy all evil from the earth and bring goodness and peace.

Premature birth is when a baby is born before the normal end of pregnancy. In humans, a pregnancy normally lasts for about nine months or 266 days.
Babies who are born before 37 complete weeks of pregnancy (calculated from the last menstrual period) are said to be "premature". In the United States, about 12% of the babies are born prematurely (that is about one in every eight babies). In 2003, there were over 490,000 premature births. 
Worldwide rates of prematurity are more difficult to get. In developing countries, there is often no professional medical care for these babies. This makes it difficult to tell how far along the pregnancy really was. For this reason, the World Health Organization tracks rates of low birth weight instead. In 2000, 16.5% of babies born in developing countries were of low birth weight. About one-third of these low birth weight deliveries are due to premature delivery.
Complications.
The risk of having a problem (called a "complication") is higher in shorter pregnancies. Babies born prematurely die more often in their first year of life than others. Most such deaths occur in the first month of life, which is called "neonatal mortality". 
Worldwide, prematurity causes 10% of neonatal mortality, or around 500,000 deaths per year. In the U.S., where many infections and other causes of neonatal death have been markedly reduced, prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal mortality at 25%. Prematurely born infants are also at greater risk of developing serious health problems, such as cerebral palsy, chronic lung disease, gastrointestinal problems, mental retardation, vision loss, or hearing loss. They are also more likely to have depression as teenagers.
Nearly half of all premature births have no known cause. When conditions permit, doctors may attempt to stop premature labor, so that the pregnancy can have a chance to continue to full term. This will increase the baby's chances of health and survival. 
In the United States, the rate of premature births has increased 30% in the past two decades.
Special care for babies born early.
In developed countries, many hospitals have special facilities for prematurely born infants. This type of hospital unit is usually called a "neonatal intensive care unit" (NICU, pronounced "NICK-you"). In the NICU, premature babies are kept warm in incubators or other warming machines. They are enclosed in plastic with equipment which keeps them warm and keeps germs away from them. 
Modern neonatal intensive care involves sophisticated measurement of temperature, respiration, heart function, oxygen supply, and brain activity. Treatments may include fluids and nutrition given through intravenous catheters; oxygen, breathing support; and medications. 
In developing countries, where advanced equipment may not be available or reliable, simple measures such as "kangaroo care" (skin-to-skin warming), encouraging breastfeeding, and basic infection control measures help reduce death rate and illness.
Chances of survival.
The earliest time in the pregnancy where the infant has at least a 50% chance of survival is called the "limit of viability". In countries with good health care, viability has been reduced to about 24 weeks. Rare survivors have been documented as early as 21 weeks, but this date is controversial because the pregnancy was measured from the date of conception rather than the date of her mother's last menstrual period. This makes gestation appear 2 weeks less than if calculated by the more common method. Risk of brain damage and developmental delay is significant at that early time. Even if the infant lives, there are ethical controversies over the care given to such infants. The limit of viability has also become a factor in the abortion debate.

Martin Hugh Michael O'Neill, OBE (b. 1 March 1952) is an Northern Irish football manager. He is currently the manager of Sunderland F.C., and has previously managed Celtic F.C.. and Aston Villa F.C. O'Neill was born in Kilrea, Northern Ireland.

The nicotine in cigarettes and other tobacco products makes people dependent. When they quit, they will get withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is there to reduce the dependency symptoms. This is usually done by delivering nicotine (or a substance very similar to it) in other ways. Common methods include "nicotine patches" and chewing gums with nicotine in them.
Cigarettes are responsible for the deaths of about 5 million people each year. These people are not killed by the nicotine in the cigarette, but by other substances in tobacco smoke such as carbon monoxide and tars. 
NRT delivers nicotine to the smoker's brain in a much slower way than cigarettes do. It helps to damp down the urges to smoke that most smokers have in the early days and weeks after quitting, rather than remove them totally. It gives the smoker the chance to break smoking cues in their daily lives, and might provide a more comfortable exit from the smoking habit. NRT however is best used with some form of support, ideally from someone who knows something about smoking cessation.
In 2005 the Committee on the Safety of Medicines recommended that NRT be given to pregnant smokers and to adolescent smokers. 
Findings from a recent Cochrane review of controlled trials testing NRT products (Stead et al. 2008) showed that smokers using NRT were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to have stopped smoking at followup than those in the placebo or control treatment condition. 
Criticism.
Nicotine is the addictive drug in tobacco products so there is a chance when using NRT products to become addicted to those products. NRT products are safer then smoking tobacco. NRT products are generally expensive, sometimes even more so then cigarettes, so a minority of people may become addicted to the NRT product and turn back to tobacco products to save money.
Types.
Electronic cigarette.
An electronic cigarette is an electronic item used instead of cigarettes. It gives a little nicotine, propylene glycol, and sometimes flavours, when you breathe through it. It was invented in China.

Metadata (also "Meta data") is data about data, that is information about other information. This is often useful. Libraries usually group books by subject and keep a catalog of the books. In that context the metadata in the catalog include various pieces of information including the author and the subject it is classified under. The index and table of contents of a book also present metadata.
Digital cameras allow people to take pictures. Here the data is the picture taken, and the metadata is information about the picture taken, like when (the date and time), photographic exposure, focal length and other technical details about how the camera made the picture. Some cameras, especially smartphones, have GPS and can include the location in metadata.

Copy-on-write (COW) is a means of optimisation in Computer Science. When several callers ask for the same resource, they can all be given a pointer to the same address. Only when they try to change the resource does a local copy need to be made. This happens without the caller noticing. It is done so that all the other callers do not see the change they did not do.

Wild goats do not rely on humans for shelter, food or medical care

The woolly flying squirrel ("Eupetaurus cinereus") is a squirrel. It is the only species of the genus "Eupetaurus". 
Until recently scientific knowledge of this rare species was limited to 11 skins collected in the late nineteenth century. However, recent research has confirmed that it is still extant in Pakistan-administered Kashmir (P.A.K). It is the longest member of the family Sciuridae and the most massive gliding animal known, but observations confirm that despite its size, it does glide effectively like other flying squirrels.

Reed-Solomon error correction is a forward error correction code. It works by oversampling a polynomial constructed from the data. The polynomial is evaluated at several points, and these values are sent or recorded. Sampling the polynomial more often than is necessary makes the polynomial over-determined. As long as it receives "many" of the points correctly, the receiver can recover the original polynomial even in the presence of a "few" bad points. 
Reed-Solomon codes are used in many different kinds of commercial applications, for example in CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, in data transmission technologies such as DSL &amp; WiMAX, and broadcast systems such as DVB and ATSC.
Overview.
Reed-Solomon codes are block codes. This means that a fixed block of input data is processed
into a fixed block of output data. In the case of the most commonly used R-S code (255, 223) – 223 Reed-Solomon input symbols (each eight bits long) are encoded into 255 output symbols.
The Reed-Solomon code, like the convolutional code, is a transparent code. This means that if
the channel symbols have been inverted somewhere along the line, the decoders will still
operate. The result will be the complement of the original data. However, the Reed-Solomon
code loses its transparency if virtual zero fill is used. For this reason it is mandatory that the
sense of the data (i.e., true or complemented) be resolved before Reed-Solomon decoding.
In the case of the Voyager program R-S codes reach near optimal performance when concatenated with the (7, 1/2) convolutional (Viterbi) inner code. Since two check symbols are required for each error to be corrected, this results in a total of 32 check symbols and 223 information symbols per codeword.
In addition, the Reed-Solomon codewords can be interleaved on a symbol basis before being
convolutionally encoded. Since this separates the symbols in a codeword, it becomes less likely
that a burst from the Viterbi decoder disturbs more than one Reed-Solomon symbol in any one
codeword.
Basic idea.
The key idea behind a Reed-Solomon code is that the data encoded is first visualized as a polynomial. The code relies on a theorem from algebra that states that any "k" distinct points "uniquely" determine a polynomial of degree at most "k"-1. 
The sender determines a degree formula_1 polynomial, over a finite field, that represents the formula_2 data points. The polynomial is then "encoded" by its evaluation at various points, and these values are what is actually sent. During transmission, some of these values may become corrupted. Therefore, more than "k" points are actually sent. As long as enough values are received correctly, the receiver can deduce what the original polynomial was, and decode the original data.
In the same sense that one can correct a curve by interpolating past a gap, a Reed-Solomon code can bridge a series of errors in a block of data to recover the coefficients of the polynomial that drew the original curve.
History.
The code was invented in 1960 by Irving S. Reed and Gustave Solomon, who were then members of MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Their seminal article was entitled "Polynomial Codes over Certain Finite Fields." When it was written, digital technology was not advanced enough to implement the concept. The first application, in 1982, of RS codes in mass-produced products was the compact disc, where two interleaved RS codes are used. An efficient decoding algorithm for large-distance RS codes was developed by Elwyn Berlekamp and James Massey in 1969. Today RS codes are used in hard disk drive, DVD, telecommunication, and digital broadcast protocols.

Continuum is the 3rd studio album by rock musician John Mayer. The album was released in September 2006. The album holds singles by "John Mayer" like "Waiting on the World to Change", "Gravity", and "Belief".
Album.
The album features mainly new songs, though "Gravity" and "Vultures" are available in live versions from John Mayer Trio's "Try!", and "", which is a Jimi Hendrix cover: the first Hendrix cover that Mayer has ever recorded as a studio release (although Mayer has recorded other Hendrix songs over time in live settings such as "The Wind Cries Mary" and "Wait Until Tomorrow"). (Mayer had played "Bold as Love" live many times prior to the release of "Continuum" such as on the televised "Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope" which aired on January 15, 2005.) The album contains a collaboration between Mayer and 8-string guitarist Charlie Hunter on the song "In Repair".

Ulmus villosa (Brandis ex Gamble, the Cherry-bark Elm) is one of the more distinctive Asiatic elms. It can live a long time.

The hoatzin ("Opisthocomus hoazin") is a tropical bird found in swamps, river forests, and mangroves of the Amazon and the Orinoco delta in South America.
They are the only bird which eats leaves as a main part of their diet. Their gut has special adaptations which help their digestion.
The hoatzin is also notable for having young with claws on two of their wing digits. They are the only living member of the family Opisthocomidae. Its close relatives probably died out long ago. There has been much debate about the hoatzin's relationships with other birds.
Life-style.
Hoatzin chicks are born with hooks on their wings. They use the hooks to climb around in the trees before they are large enough to fly. Hoatzins can fly only short distances even when they are fully grown, so they usually climb.
They build their nests over water. If danger threatens, the birds dive into the water. They climb back up the tree after the danger has passed.
Hoatzins communicate through unusual sounds that resemble wheezing, grunting, growls, and hisses.
Digestion.
The hoatzin is the only bird that digests leaves. Their odor has been compared to fresh cow dung. The odor is caused by their digestive system.
The hoatzin eats the leaves and some fruits and flowers of plants which grow in the wet habitats where it lives. It clambers around clumsily among the branches. Once it was thought that the species only could eat the leaves of arums and mangroves, but the species does eat the leaves of more than fifty species. One study undertaken in Venezuela found that the hoatzin diet was 82% leaves, 10% flowers, and 8% fruit.
One of this species' many peculiarities is that it has a digestive system unique amongst birds. Hoatzins use bacterial fermentation in the front part of the gut to break down the vegetable material, much as cattle and other ruminants do. Unlike ruminants, however, which have the rumen (a specialized stomach for bacterial fermentation), the hoatzin has an unusually large crop, folded in two chambers, and a large, multi-chambered lower oesophagus. Its stomach chamber and gizzard are much smaller than in other birds.
The crop of the hoatzin is so large that it displaces the flight muscles and keel of the sternum. This is why they fly so poorly. Because of aromatic compounds in the leaves they eat, and the bacterial fermentation, the bird has a disagreeable, manure-like odor. It is only hunted by humans for food in times of great need. If the bird feeds on insects or other animal matter, that is purely accidental.
Relationships.
So far (2015) very few birds have had their total genome analysed. More recently, a start was made to sequence the entire genome of the hoatzin. As of 2011, it was reported that more than 1.4 billion base pairs of hoatzin DNA had been sequenced, roughly equal to its entire haploid genome, but that only about 2.4% of its genome had yet been assembled. Of birds, the genomes of only four species have been sequenced. Much might be learned by coordinating these efforts with analysing the hoatzin foregut ruminant bacterial microflora. At present, the nearest relatives of the hoatzin are not known. There is a fossil record which suggests its lineage is fairly ancient.

The cucumber ("Cucumis sativus") is a widely grown plant in the family Cucurbitaceae. This family also includes squash. A cucumber looks similar to a zucchini (British English: courgette). 
To a botanist, cucumbers are biologically fruits even if they are commonly thought of as vegetables: that is their value as a food. They can be cooked, eaten raw, or pickled. Some people hollow out the cucumber and fill it with other food, like tomatoes or feta cheese. 

This is a list of episodes of the children's television series with the Teletubbies.

The College Dropout is the debut album by rapper and producer Kanye West, released February 10, 2004. It was nominated for Grammy Award for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album and Best Rap Song for "Jesus Walks" in 2005. The album has received great acclaim from critics and mainstream fans alike, for its balance of mainstream commercial appeal and its innovative subject matter. It has been called one of the greatest albums of all time by "Time" and "Rolling Stone".
Background and production.
Kanye West had gotten attention for his production but was not well-known for his rapping. He was turned down by record labels because he didn't have the gangsta image that was popular at that time. He eventually signed with Roc-A-Fella Records. In 2002, West was in a bad car accident which gave him a shattered jaw, so his jaw had to be wired shut. He recorded a song called "Through the Wire" with his jaw still wired shut. This song helped him get a starting point for the album.
The album was recorded at The Record Plant in California. The beats used mainly had pitch shifted samples from gospel and soul records. Some of the beats used were gathered over a long period of time. When the album was finished, it was leaked. West used this as an opportunity to re-assess the album and improve it. He added strings and gospel choirs into his songs.
Lyrics.
The album was different from the gangsta rap that was popular at that time. The lyrics were on subjects that affected West's life such as family, religion, racism, materialism and more.
Commercial performance.
"The College Dropout" reached #1 on Billboard's Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums Chart, and reached #2 on the "Billboard" 200. In the UK, it peaked at #12 on the album chart and spent several months in the top 20. The album went triple platinum in the United States.
The first single from the album, "Through the Wire", was recorded while West's mouth was wired shut after a near-fatal car accident in October 2002. It features a Chaka Khan sample, peaked at #15 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart while its successor "All Falls Down", which features R&amp;B singer Syleena Johnson, peaked at #7. The third single, "Jesus Walks", peaked at #11 while a fourth extract, "The New Workout Plan", made a minor impression on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop charts (see list of US Billboard chart positions below). In the UK, "Through The Wire" peaked at #9 on the singles sales chart, "All Falls Down" peaked at #10, and "Jesus Walks" peaked at #11.

The Fowler Ridge Wind Farm is a wind farm in Benton County, Indiana, near the city of Fowler, IN about northwest of Indianapolis. Fowler Ridge was constructed in two phases and has a generating capacity of 600 MW. 

T. Boone Pickens, a former Texas oilman, is planning to build the world's largest wind farm, called the Pampa Wind Project, as part of the Pickens Plan. It will be developed by Pickens' company, Mesa Power. The proposed 4,000 MW facility will be located near Pampa, Texas, which is on the Texas Panhandle, and will stretch to the east, spanning 400,000 acres in five counties. This will provide enough power for 1.5 million average homes.
When it was planned, it would have been the largest wind farm in the United States. As of May 2008, the largest U.S. wind plant is the Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center with a capacity of 736 MW.
Electric transmission lines must connect wind farms to the places where the electricity is used. People fought over whether wind farm owners or electricity users should pay to build these lines. On July 17, 2008, the Texas Public Utilities Commission ruled that ratepayers should pay $4.93 billion to build the lines to connect wind farms in the Texas Panhandle to the Texas electric grid. This implements a 2005 Texas law designed to promote new wind energy projects.
On March 2, 2009, Mesa Power announced that it was working on the first phase of the project. But had put off work on the later phases. It canceled 120 of 197 wind leases. 
In July 2009, Mesa Power delayed (but did not cancel) the project. Mesa Power said the project must wait because it did not have transmission capacity to the site and poor credit market. Mesa Power will restart the Pampa Wind Farm project in 2013, when transmission lines are due to be completed in the area. In the meantime, Mesa Power will use the 667 turbines it purchased to build several smaller wind farms.

Ultimate (often called Ultimate Frisbee in reference to the trademarked brand name) is a non-contact team sport played with a 175 gram flying disc on a rectangular field. Opposing teams of 7 players try to move the disc into the opponent's end zone by throwing the disc to each other. A point is scored when one team catches the disc in the other team's end zone. A typical ultimate game will finish when one team scores fifteen points. Ultimate is most often played on grass or turf fields but can also be played on sand.
Game Length.
An ultimate game is made up of two periods of play which are called halves. In a game played to fifteen points, the first half finishes when one team reaches eight points. A game of ultimate may finish before one team reaches fifteen points if there is a time cap. A time cap limits the duration of a game.
Rules and Spirit of the Game.
The World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF) controls the rules of play and game structure for international competitions. However, players of ultimate are individually responsible for upholding the rules of ultimate. Unlike other sports, there are no referees in ultimate. Players must call their own fouls or infractions and must resolve conflict by communicating directly with the opposing team. All players are expected to follow the Spirit of the Game, which describes how fair play is critical to ultimate.
Passing.
The disc can only be moved by passing, but the player with the disc can pivot on one foot. If a pass is incomplete (touches the ground or is caught or knocked down by a defending player) or out of bounds, it is a "turnover" and the other team gets possession of the disc.

New Line Film Productions Inc., often called New Line Cinema, is an American movie studio. It was founded in 1967 by Robert Shaye. It became a subsidiary of WarnerMedia in 1996. It was merged into the bigger studio Warner Bros. in 2008.
In comparison with other independent motion picture studios.
Unlike other independent studios such as Orion Pictures, Carolco Pictures, or Cannon Films, New Line Cinema has grown and prospered to become one of Hollywood's major movie studios, culminating in the hit "Lord of the Rings" movie trilogy that brought prestige to the studio.

In 1953, there was an Iranian coup d'état to remove the Prime Minister of Iran, Mohammad Mossadeq, from power. The coup d'état was nicknamed Operation Ajax. The coup was planned by the CIA and Britain's MI6 in August 1953.
Causes.
In 1951, Mossaddeq was the chairman of Iran's Oil Committee. He was highly supported by the people of Iran. At that time, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was in power. The Majlis (Iranian Parliament) voted for a law to "nationalize" (take the company away from the people who owned it and make it owned by the government) the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, an oil company in Iran.
Mossaddeq was elected Prime Minister of Iran in April 1951. His first action as Prime Minister was to put the oil nationalization in place.
The British government had a plan for a coup d'etat to remove Mossadeq from power. They managed to get the United States CIA to help with the coup. The coup was planned by Monty Woodhouse. It was carried out by MI6 and the CIA, and led by General Fazlollah Zahedi, who later went into exile.
Later.
Mossaddeq was replaced by Fazlollah Zahedi, but Mossaddeq refused to step down. A military dictatorship was put in place. Shah Pahlavi was put back in power. (Pahlavi was in power before this, but he was forced to put Mossadeq back in power at the time.) This made the people angry. They would later start the Iranian Revolution in 1979. The revolution put the Ayatollah Khomeini in power.

The July Ultimatum was a demand issued by Austria-Hungary to the Royal Serbian Government at 6 pm on 23 July 1914, after the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. 
Austria-Hungary's government did not directly accuse Serbia for the assassination but for "doing nothing to suppress" the subversive anti-Austro-Hungarian movement in Serbia which grew beyond Serbia's borders and which was responsible for acts of terrorism, assassination attempts and murders.
Serbia refused to accept one of the ten items of the ultimatum, and so Austria-Hungary mobilized their army. This, along with a chain of Alliances in Europe (Triple Entente and Central Powers) helped cause World War I.
The Ultimatum Requests.
The Ultimatum requested Serbia to pledge itself for the following:
The Russian Memorandum of Advice to Serbia.
The Russia asked Austria-Hungaria to extend the ultimatum deadline which would allow the Governments of the Great Powers to become acquainted with and to investigate the documents on the Sarajevo crime.
The Serbian Response.
The Royal Government binds itself further:

Worcestershire sauce (spoken like ˈwʊstəˌʃɪə or WUSS-ter-SHERR) is a widely-used fermented sauce. It was first made at 68 Broad Street, Worcester, by the company Lea &amp; Perrins in the 1830s. It was made for selling to people in 1837, and is still the only Worcestershire sauce still to be made in the UK. In 1930 the company was sold to HP Foods and was later sold to the H.J. Heinz Company from Groupe Danone in 2005.
The sauce is made ready to sell in the Midlands Road factory in Worcester, which is the home of Lea &amp; Perrins since 16 October 1897.
The H. J. Heinz Company, which now makes "The Original Lea &amp; Perrins Worcestershire Sauce", with the name Lea &amp; Perrins, Inc., lists these ingredients on the bottle made in the United States: vinegar, molasses, high fructose corn syrup, anchovies, water, onions, salt, garlic, tamarind concentrate, cloves, natural flavorings and chili pepper extract.

The Guadalcanal Campaign was fought between August 7, 1942, and February 9, 1943, in the Pacific theatre of World War II. This campaign, which was a decisive and strategically important campaign of World War II, was fought on the ground, at sea, and in the air between Allied forces against Imperial Japanese forces. The fighting took place on and around the island of Guadalcanal in the southern Solomon Islands, and was the first major offensive launched by Allied forces against the Empire of Japan.
On August 7, 1942, Allied forces, mainly from the United States, started landings on the islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida in the southern Solomons with the aim to make supply routes between the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand safer.
The Battle of Guadalcanal was one of the first long campaigns in the Pacific.
Background.
Strategic considerations.
On 7 December 1941, Japanese forces attacked the neutral United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The attack killed almost 2,500 people and damaged much of the US battleship fleet, starting a war between the two nations next day. The initial goals of Japanese leaders were to destroy the US Navy, seize lands rich in natural resources, and establish strategic military bases to defend Japan's empire in the Pacific Ocean and Asia. To do this, Japanese forces captured the Philippines, Thailand, Malaya, Singapore, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, and many small islands. Joining the U.S. in the war against Japan were the rest of the Allied powers, several of whom, including the United Kingdom, Australia and the Netherlands had also been attacked by Japan.
The naval battle of the Coral Sea prevented a quick Japanese conquest of Australia and the Battle of Midway reduced Japan's carrier forces. 
The Allies chose the southern Solomon Islands including Guadalcanal, as the first target. The Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had occupied Tulagi in May 1942 and had constructed a seaplane base nearby. Allied concern grew when, in early July 1942, the IJN began constructing a large airfield at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal. From there, Japanese long range bombers would threaten the East Coast of Australia. By August 1942, the Japanese had about 900 naval troops on Tulagi and nearby islands and 2,800 people on Guadalcanal. These bases would protect Japan's major base at Rabaul, threaten Allied supply and communication lines and establish base for attacks against Fiji, New Caledonia and Samoa.
The Japanese planned to send 45 fighters and 60 bombers to Guadalcanal. In 1942 these aircraft could provide air cover for Japanese naval forces advancing into the South Pacific.
The Allied plan to invade the southern Solomons was thought of by U.S. Admiral Ernest King, Commander in Chief, United States Fleet. He wanted to take the islands away from the Japanese. With Roosevelt's agreement, King also wanted to invade Guadalcanal. Because the United States supported Great Britain's idea of defeating Germany before Japan, the Pacific war had to compete for troops and resources with the European war.
Therefore US Army General George C. Marshall was against King's proposed attacks and asked who would command the operation. King replied that the Navy and Marines would do it themselves and instructed Admiral Chester Nimitz to plan the attacks. King won the argument with Marshall and the invasion went ahead.
The Guadalcanal attack would be carried out in at the same time as an Allied offensive in New Guinea under Douglas MacArthur. The goal was to capture the Admiralty Islands and the Bismarck Archipelago, including the major Japanese base at Rabaul. Eventually they would take the Philippines. The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff put Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley in command on 19 June 1942, to direct the attack in the Solomons.
Admiral Chester Nimitz, based at Pearl Harbor, was the overall Allied commander in chief for Pacific forces.
Task force.
In preparation for the attack in the Pacific in May 1942, the U.S. 1st Marine Division moved from the United States to New Zealand. Other Allied land, naval and air force units were sent to other Pacific islands. The attack was codenamed "Operation Watchtower", with the date set for 7 August 1942.
At first, the attacks were planned just for Tulagi and the Santa Cruz Islands, and not Guadalcanal. When the Allies discovered the Japanese airfield on Guadalcanal, its capture was added to the plan and the Santa Cruz operation was dropped. The Japanese knew Allied forces were moving but thought they were going to Australia and perhaps Port Moresby in New Guinea.
The "Watchtower" force, numbering 75 warships and transports (of vessels from the U.S. and Australia), assembled near Fiji on 26 July 1942. They did one rehearsal landing prior to leaving for Guadalcanal on 31 July. The commander of the Allied force was U.S. Vice Admiral Frank Fletcher (flag in aircraft carrier ). Commanding the sea and land forces was U.S. Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner. Vandegrift led the 16,000 Allied (primarily U.S. Marine) infantry for the landings.
The troops sent to Guadalcanal were fresh from military training and armed with M1903 Springfield rifles and a 10-day supply of ammunition. To get them into battle quickly, the operation planners had reduced their supplies to only 60 days. The troops of the 1st Marine Division began referring to the coming battle as "Operation Shoestring".
Landings.
Bad weather allowed the Allied force to arrive near Guadalcanal unseen by the Japanese on the night of 6 August and the morning of 7 August and take the defenders by surprise. This has sometimes been called the Midnight Raid on Guadalcanal. The landing force split into two groups, with one group attacking Guadalcanal, and the other Tulagi, Florida, and nearby islands.
Allied warships bombed the invasion beaches while U.S. carrier aircraft bombed Japanese forces on the target islands and destroyed 15 Japanese seaplanes at their base near Tulagi.
Tulagi and two nearby small islands, Gavutu and Tanambogo, were attacked by 3,000 U.S. Marines. The 886 IJN forces violently resisted the Marine attacks. With some difficulty, the Marines captured all three islands; Tulagi on 8 August, and Gavutu and Tanambogo by 9 August.
The Japanese defenders were almost all killed while the Marines had 122 killed.
The landings on Guadalcanal had much less resistance. On 7 August, 11,000 U.S. Marines came ashore on Guadalcanal and met no resistance. They stopped for the night about from the Lunga Point airfield. The next day, against little resistance, the Marines advanced to Lunga River and captured the airfield by 16:00 on 8 August.
The Japanese naval construction staff and combat troops had abandoned the airfield area and fled about west to the Matanikau River and Point Cruz area. They left behind food, supplies, construction equipment and vehicles, and 13 dead.
During the landing operations on 7 and 8 August, Japanese naval aircraft based at Rabaul, under the command of Sadayoshi Yamada, attacked the Allied forces several times, setting afire the transport USS "George F. Elliot" (which sank two days later) and heavily damaging the destroyer . In the air attacks over the two days, the Japanese lost 36 aircraft, while the U.S. lost 19, both in combat and to accident, including 14 carrier fighters.
After these fights, Fletcher was concerned about the losses to his carrier fighter aircraft. He was also anxious about the threat to his carriers from Japanese air attacks, and worried about his ships' fuel levels. Fletcher pulled back from the Solomon Islands area with his carrier task forces the evening of 8 August. As a result of the loss of carrier-based air cover, Turner pulled back his ships from Guadalcanal, even though less than half of the supplies and heavy equipment needed by the troops ashore had been unloaded. Turner planned, however, to unload as many supplies as possible on Guadalcanal and Tulagi throughout the night of 8 August and then depart with his ships early on 9 August.
Battle of Savo Island.
That night, as the transports unloaded, two groups of Allied cruisers and destroyers, under the command of British Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley VC, were defeated by a Japanese force of seven cruisers and one destroyer from the 8th Fleet based at Rabaul and Kavieng and commanded by Japanese Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa.
In the Battle of Savo Island one Australian and three American cruisers were sunk and one American cruiser and two destroyers were damaged. The Japanese had moderate damage to one cruiser. Mikawa, who was unaware Fletcher was preparing to pull back with the U.S. carriers, immediately went back to Rabaul without attempting to attack the transports. Mikawa was concerned about daylight U.S. carrier air attacks if he remained in the area. Without carrier air cover, Turner decided to pull back his remaining naval forces by the evening of 9 August. This left the Marines ashore without much of the heavy equipment, supplies and troops still aboard the transports. Mikawa's decision not to attempt to destroy the Allied transport ships was a big mistake.
Initial operations.
The 11,000 Marines on Guadalcanal at first set up a guard around Lunga Point and the airfield. They also moved the landed supplies ashore and finished the airfield. By 18 August the airfield was ready for operation. Five days worth of food had been landed from the transports, which, along with captured Japanese food, gave the Marines a total of 14 days worth of food. To conserve supplies, the troops were limited to two meals per day.
Allied troops got sick with dysentery soon after the landings, with one in five Marines sick by mid-August. Tropical diseases affected both sides' troops. Although some of the Korean construction workers surrendered to the Marines, most of the Japanese and Korean gathered to the west and ate coconuts. A Japanese naval outpost was also located at Taivu Point, about 35 kilometres (22 mi) east of the Lunga perimeter. On 8 August, a Japanese destroyer from Rabaul delivered 113 troops to the Matanikau position.
On the evening of 12 August, a 25-man U.S. Marine patrol landed by boat to try and find a group of Japanese troops that U.S. forces thought might be willing to surrender. Soon after the patrol landed, a nearby platoon of Japanese naval troops attacked and almost completely killed the Marine patrol.
On 19 August, Vandegrift sent three companies of the U.S. 5th Marine Regiment to attack the Japanese troops west of the Matanikau. One company attacked at the mouth of the Matanikau river while another crossed the river inland and attacked the Japanese forces in Matanikau village. The third landed by boat further west and attacked Kokumbuna village. After briefly occupying the two villages, the three Marine companies returned to the Lunga perimeter, having killed about 65 Japanese soldiers while losing four.
This was the first of several major actions around the Matanikau River during the battle.
On 20 August, the escort carrier delivered two squadrons of Marine aircraft to Henderson Field, one a squadron of 19 F4F Wildcats and the other a squadron of 12 SBD Dauntlesses. The aircraft at Henderson became known as the "Cactus Air Force" (CAF) after the Allied codename for Guadalcanal.
The Marine fighters were used the next day. There were Japanese bomber air raids almost every day. On 22 August five U.S. Army P-400 Airacobras and their pilots arrived at Henderson Field.
Battle of the Tenaru.
In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the Imperial Japanese Army's (IJA) 17th Army at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake, was ordered to retake Guadalcanal. The army was to be supported by Japanese naval units, including the Combined Fleet under the command of Isoroku Yamamoto, which was headquartered at Truk. The 17th Army, at that time involved in the Japanese campaign in New Guinea, had only a few units available. The 35th Infantry Brigade under Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi was at Palau. The 4th (Aoba) Infantry Regiment was in the Philippines and the 28th (Ichiki) Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel Kiyonao Ichiki, was on transport ships near Guam.
The different units began to move towards Guadalcanal. Ichiki's unit, consisting of about 917 soldiers, landed from destroyers at Taivu Pointbafter midnight on 19 August, then made a night march west toward the Marines. The Ichiki regiment was named after its commanding officer.
Ichiki thought that there were not that many Allied soldiers on Guadalcanal. Ichiki's soldiers attacked Marine positions at Alligator Creek in the early morning hours of 21 August. Ichiki's attack was defeated with heavy Japanese losses in what became known as the Battle of the Tenaru. In the day, the Marines attacked Ichiki's surviving troops, killing many more of them.
The dead included Ichiki, though it has been claimed that he committed suicide after realizing his defeat, rather than dying in combat. In total, all but 128 of the original 917 members of the Ichiki Regiment's force were killed in the battle. The survivors returned to Taivu Point, notified 17th Army headquarters of their defeat and waited for new soldiers and orders from Rabaul.
Battle of the Eastern Solomons.
As the Tenaru battle was ending, more Japanese troops were already on their way. Three slow transports departed from Truk on 16 August carrying the remaining 1,400 soldiers from Ichiki's (28th) Infantry Regiment plus 500 naval marines from the 5th Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Force.
The transports were guarded by 13 warships commanded by Japanese Rear Admiral Raizo Tanaka. He planned to land the troops on Guadalcanal on 24 August. To cover the landings and retake Henderson Field from Allied forces, Yamamoto directed Chuichi Nagumo to meet with a carrier force from Truk on 21 August and head towards the southern Solomon Islands. Nagumo's force included three carriers and 30 other warships.
Three U.S. carrier task forces under Fletcher approached Guadalcanal to attack the Japanese. On 24 and 25 August, the two carrier forces fought the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, which resulted in both fleets pulling back from the area after taking some damage. Japan lost one light aircraft carrier. Tanaka's convoy, after getting heavy damage during the battle from an air attack by aircraft from Henderson Field, including the sinking of one of the transports, changed direction to the Shortland Islands in the northern Solomons. This was done to transfer the troops to destroyers for delivery to Guadalcanal.
Air battles and strengthening of the Lunga defenses.
Throughout August, small numbers of U.S. aircraft and their crews continued to arrive at Guadalcanal. By the end of August, 64 aircraft of various types were stationed at Henderson Field. Air battles between the Allied aircraft at Henderson and Japanese bombers and fighters from Rabaul continued almost daily. Between 26 August and 5 September, the U.S. lost about 15 aircraft while the Japanese lost approximately 19 aircraft. More than half of the downed U.S. aircrews were rescued while most of the Japanese aircrews were never recovered. The eight-hour round trip flight from Rabaul to Guadalcanal, about total, made it hard for the Japanese to attack Henderson Field.
Australians on Bougainville and New Georgia islands were often able to warn of Japanese air strikes, allowing the U.S. fighters time to take off and attack the Japanese bombers and fighters as they approached the island.
Between 21 August and 3 September, three Marine battalions, including the 1st Raider Battalion, under Merritt A. Edson (Edson's Raiders), and the 1st Parachute Battalion from Tulagi and Gavutu went to Guadalcanal. These units added about 1,500 troops to the original 11,000 men defending Henderson Field. The 1st Parachute Battalion, which had many dead and wounded in the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo in August, was placed under Edson's command.
The other relocated battalion, the 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment (1/5), was landed west of the Matanikau near Kokumbuna village on 27 August. They had the mission of attacking Japanese units in the area. They faced hot sun, and strong Japanese defenses. The next morning, the Marines found that the Japanese defenders had departed during the night, so the Marines returned to the Lunga perimeter by boat. Losses in this action were 20 Japanese and 3 Marines killed.
Small Allied naval convoys arrived at Guadalcanal on 23 August 29 August, 1 September, and 8 September. They provided the Marines at Lunga with more food, ammunition, aircraft fuel, and aircraft technicians. The 1 September convoy also brought 392 construction engineers to work on Henderson Field.
Tokyo Express.
By 23 August, Kawaguchi's 35th Infantry Brigade reached Truk and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to Guadalcanal. The damage done to Tanaka's convoy during the Battle of the Eastern Solomons made the Japanese decide not to deliver more troops to Guadalcanal by slow transport. Instead, ships carrying Kawaguchi's soldiers were sent to Rabaul.
From there, the Japanese planned to deliver Kawaguchi's men to Guadalcanal by destroyers. The Japanese destroyers were usually able to make round trips down (New Georgia Sound) to Guadalcanal and back in a single night throughout the campaign, minimizing their risk of Allied air attack.
The runs became known as the "Tokyo Express" to Allied Forces by the Japanese.
Delivering the troops like this made it hard to bring heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition to Guadalcanal. In addition, this activity used destroyers the IJN needed for commerce defense. The Allied naval commanders did not fight Japanese naval forces at night. However, any Japanese ship remaining within range of the aircraft at Henderson Field during the daylight hours, about , was in great danger from air attack. Thissituation existed for the next several months of the battle.
Between 29 August and 4 September, Japanese light cruisers, destroyers, and patrol boats were able to land almost 5,000 troops at Taivu Point, including most of the 35th Infantry Brigade, much of the Aoba (4th) Regiment, and the rest of Ichiki's regiment. General Kawaguchi, who landed at Taivu Point on 31 August Express run, was placed in command of all Japanese forces on Guadalcanal. A barge convoy took another 1,000 soldiers of Kawaguchi's brigade, under the command of Colonel Akinosuke Oka, to Kamimbo, west of the Lunga perimeter.
Battle of Edson's Ridge.
On 7 September, Kawaguchi issued his attack plan to destroy enemy in the Guadalcanal Island airfield. Kawaguchi's attack plan called for his forces to do a surprise night attack. Oka's forces would attack from the west while Ichiki's Second Echelon would attack from the east. The main attack would be by Kawaguchi's group of 3,000 men in three battalions, from the south. By 7 September, most of Kawaguchi's troops began marching towards Lunga Point along the coastline. About 250 Japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade's supply base at Taivu.
Meanwhile, scouts brought reports to the U.S. Marines of Japanese troops at Taivu near the village of Tasimboko. Edson planned a raid on the Japanese troops at Taivu. On 8 September, after being dropped-off near Taivu by boat, Edson's men captured Tasimboko as the Japanese retreated into the jungle.
In Tasimboko, Edson's troops discovered Kawaguchi's main supply depot, including large stockpiles of food, ammunition, medical supplies, and a powerful shortwave radio. After destroying everything, except some papers, the Marines returned to the Lunga perimeter. The captured documents informed the Marines that at least 3,000 Japanese troops were on the island and planning an attack.
Edson, along with Colonel Gerald C. Thomas, Vandegrift's operations officer, thought that the Japanese attack would come at a narrow, grassy, -long, coral ridge south of Henderson Field. The ridge, called Lunga Ridge, had a good approach to the airfield and it was undefended. On 11 September, the 840 men of Edson's battalion were sent onto and around the ridge.
On the night of 12 September, Kawaguchi's 1st Battalion attacked the Raiders between the Lunga River and ridge. One Marine company had to fall back to the ridge before the Japanese stopped their attack for the night. The next night Kawaguchi had to battle Edson's 830 Raiders with 3,000 troops of his brigade and artillery. The Japanese attack began just after nightfall with Kawaguchi's 1st battalion attacking Edson's right side to the west of the ridge. After breaking through the Marine defences, the attack was eventually stopped by Marine units guarding the northern part of the ridge.
Two companies from Kawaguchi's 2nd Battalion moved up the southern edge of the ridge and pushed Edson's troops back to Hill 123 on the center part of the ridge. Throughout the night the Marines fought against Japanese attacks, some of which resulted in hand-to-hand fighting. The Marines also had artillery. Japanese groups that got past the ridge to the edge of the airfield were also sent back.
Attacks by the Kuma battalion and Oka's unit at other places were also stopped. On 14 September Kawaguchi led the survivors on a five-day march west to the Matanikau Valley to join with Oka's unit. In total Kawaguchi's forces lost about 850 killed and the Marines 104.
On 15 September Hyakutake at Rabaul learned of Kawaguchi's loss and sent the news to Imperial General Headquarters in Japan. In an emergency meeting, the top Japanese IJA and IJN command staffs decided that, Guadalcanal might develop into the most important battle of the war. The loss affected Japanese operations in other areas of the Pacific. Hyakutake realized that to send sufficient troops and supplies to defeat the Allied forces on Guadalcanal he could not support the major ongoing Japanese attacks on the Kokoda Track in New Guinea.
Hyakutake, with the agreement of General Headquarters, ordered his troops on New Guinea who were within of their goal of Port Moresby to pull back until the Guadalcanal battle was finished. Hyakutake sent more troops to Guadalcanal for another attempt to recapture Henderson Field.
Reinforcement.
As the Japanese troops gathered west of the Matanikau, the U.S. forces strengthened their Lunga defenses. On 14 September Vandegrift moved another battalion, the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment (3/2), from Tulagi to Guadalcanal. On 18 September an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade (the 7th Marine Regiment plus a battalion from the 11th Marine Regiment and some additional support units).
The convoy also delivered 137 vehicles, tents, aviation fuel, ammunition, rations and engineering equipment to Guadalcanal. These new soldiers enabled Vandegrift, beginning on 19 September, to establish an unbroken defence around the Lunga perimeter. While protecting this convoy the aircraft carrier was sunk by the Japanese submarine southeast of Guadalcanal. For a while, this left only one Allied aircraft carrier () in the South Pacific area.
Vandegrift also removed several officers who did not meet his standards and promoted junior officers who had done well in the battles. Colonel Merritt Edson who was given command of the 5th Marine Regiment.
The air war over Guadalcanal stopped for a while. There were no Japanese air raids between 14 and 27 September due to bad weather. Both sides reinforced their air units during this time. The Japanese delivered 85 fighters and bombers to their air units at Rabaul while the U.S. brought 23 fighters and attack aircraft to Henderson Field. On 20 September the Japanese had 117 aircraft at Rabaul while the Allies had 71 aircraft at Henderson Field.
The air war got started again with a Japanese air raid on Guadalcanal on 27 September. U.S. Navy and Marine fighters from Henderson Field flew up to try to stop the air raid.
The Japanese began to prepare for their next attempt to recapture Henderson Field. The 3rd Battalion, 4th (Aoba) Infantry Regiment had landed at Kamimbo Bay on the western end of Guadalcanal on 11 September. The battalion had joined Oka's forces near the Matanikau. Deliveries by destroyers on 14, 20, 21 and 24 September brought food and ammunition as well as 280 men from the 1st Battalion, Aoba Regiment, to Kamimbo on Guadalcanal.
The Japanese 2nd and 38th Infantry Divisions were transported from the Dutch East Indies to Rabaul beginning on 13 September. The Japanese planned to transport 17,500 troops from these two divisions to Guadalcanal for the next major attack on the Lunga Perimeter set for 20 October 1942.
Actions along the Matanikau.
Vandegrift was aware that Kawaguchi's troops had retreated to the area west of the Matanikau and that numerous groups of Japanese troops were in the area between the Lunga Perimeter and the Matanikau River. Vandegrift decided to attack the scattered groups of Japanese troops east of the Matanikau.
He also wanted to prevent the main group of Japanese soldiers from strengthening their positions so close to the main Marine defenses at Lunga Point.
The first U.S. Marine attack between 23 and 27 September used soldiers from three U.S. Marine battalions. The attack on Japanese forces west of the Matanikau, was defeated by Kawaguchi's troops under Akinosuke Oka's command. During the fight, three Marine companies were surrounded by Japanese forces and they had many dead and wounded. They escaped with help from the destroyer and landing craft piloted by U.S. Coast Guard personnel.
In the second attack between 6 and 9 October a larger force of Marines crossed the Matanikau River, attacked newly landed Japanese forces from the 2nd Infantry Division under the command of generals Masao Maruyama and Yumio Nasu. The Marines inflicted caused a lot of deaths and wounding for the Japanese 4th Infantry Regiment.
The second attack forced the Japanese to retreat from their positions east of the Matanikau. This caused problems with Japanese plans to do a major attack on the U.S. Lunga defenses.
Between 9 and 11 October the U.S. 1st Battalion 2nd Marines attacked two small Japanese outposts about east of the Lunga perimeter at Gurabusu and Koilotumaria near Aola Bay. The attacks killed 35 Japanese at a cost of 17 Marines and three U.S. Navy personnel.
Battle of Cape Esperance.
Throughout the last week of September and the first week of October, Japanese destroyers delivered troops from the Japanese 2nd Infantry Division to Guadalcanal. The Japanese Navy promised to support the Army's attack by delivering troops, equipment, and supplies to the island and doing more air attacks on Henderson Field and sending warships to bomb the airfield.
Millard F. Harmon, commander of United States Army forces in the South Pacific, thought that U.S. Marine forces on Guadalcanal needed new soldiers if the Allies were to defend the island from the next Japanese attack. On 8 October, the 2,837 men of the 164th Infantry Regiment from the U.S. Army's Americal Division boarded ships to Guadalcanal. To protect the transports carrying the 164th to Guadalcanal, Task Force 64 was told to go with the transports. This task force consisted of four cruisers and five destroyers under U.S. Rear Admiral Norman Scott.
They were told to attack any Japanese ships that approached Guadalcanal.
Mikawa's 8th Fleet staff scheduled a large and important destroyer delivery for the night of 11 October. Two seaplane tenders and six destroyers were to deliver 728 soldiers plus artillery and ammunition to Guadalcanal. At the same time, three heavy cruisers and two destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Aritomo Gotō were to bomb Henderson Field to destroy the CAF and the airfield.
Because U.S. Navy warships had never tried to stop any Tokyo Express missions to Guadalcanal, the Japanese were not expecting any opposition from Allied naval ships that night.
Just before midnight, Scott's warships detected Gotō's force on radar near Guadalcanal. Scott's force was in a position to fire on Gotō's ships. Opening fire, Scott's warships sank one of Gotō's cruisers and one of his destroyers, heavily damaged another cruiser, seriously wounded Gotō, and forced the rest of Gotō's warships to abandon the bombing mission and retreat.
One of Scott's destroyers was sunk and one cruiser and another destroyer were heavily damaged. The Japanese supply convoy unloaded at Guadalcanal and began its return journey without being discovered by Scott's force. Later on the morning of 12 October, four Japanese destroyers from the supply convoy turned back to help Gotō's damaged warships.
Air attacks by CAF aircraft from Henderson Field sank two of these destroyers later that day. The convoy of U.S. Army troops reached Guadalcanal as scheduled the next day and delivered its cargo and passengers to the island.
Battleship bombing of Henderson Field.
Even after the U.S. victory off Cape Esperance, the Japanese continued with plans for a large attack later in October. The Japanese decided to risk not using fast warships to deliver their men and supplies to the island.
On 13 October, a convoy of six cargo ships with eight destroyers left the Shortland Islands for Guadalcanal. The convoy carried 4,500 troops from the 16th and 230th Infantry Regiments, some naval marines, two batteries of heavy artillery, and one company of tanks.
To protect the approaching convoy from attack by CAF aircraft, Yamamoto sent two battleships from Truk to bombard Henderson Field. At 01:33 on 14 October, and , protected by one light cruiser and nine destroyers, reached Guadalcanal and fired at Henderson Field from a distance of . Over the next one hour and 23 minutes, the two battleships fired 973 shells into the Lunga perimeter, most of them falling in the area of the airfield. Many of the shells were fragmentation shells, designed to destroy land targets. The bombing heavily damaged both runways, burned almost all of the available airplane fuel, destroyed 48 of the CAF's 90 aircraft, and killed 41 men, including six CAF pilots. The battleship force then returned to Truk.
In spite of the heavy damage, Henderson soldiers were able to fix one of the runways within a few hours. Seventeen SBDs and 20 Wildcats at Espiritu Santo were flown to Henderson and U.S. Army and Marine transport aircraft began to transport airplane gasoline to Guadalcanal.
Now that the US was aware of the approach of the large Japanese convoy, the US tried to think of a way to attack the convoy before it could reach Guadalcanal. Using fuel drained from destroyed aircraft and from a hidden fuel tank in the jungle, the CAF attacked the convoy twice on the 14th, but caused no damage.
The Japanese convoy reached Guadalcanal at midnight on 14 October and began unloading. Throughout the day of 15 October, CAF aircraft from Henderson bombed and machine-gunned the unloading convoy, destroying three of the cargo ships. The remainder of the convoy departed that night, having unloaded all of the troops and about two-thirds of the supplies and equipment.
Several Japanese heavy cruisers also bombed Henderson on the nights of 14 and 15 October, destroying a few additional CAF aircraft, but not damaging the airfield.
Battle for Henderson Field.
Between 1 and 17 October, the Japanese delivered 15,000 troops to Guadalcanal, giving Hyakutake 20,000 troops for his planned attack. Because they had lost their positions on the east side of the Matanikau, the Japanese decided that an attack on the U.S. defenses along the coast would be too hard. Hyakutake decided to attack from south of Henderson Field.
His 2nd Division (with troops from the 38th Division), under Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama and 7,000 soldiers in three infantry regiments was ordered to attack the American defences from the south near the east bank of the Lunga River.
The date of the attack was set for 22 October, then changed to 23 October. To try and trick the Americans from knowing about the planned attack from the south, Hyakutake's heavy artillery plus five battalions of infantry (about 2,900 men) under Major General Tadashi Sumiyoshi attacked the American defenses from the west.
The Japanese thought that there were 10,000 American troops on the island, when in there were really 23,000.
On 12 October, a group of Japanese engineers began to cut a trail, called the "Maruyama Road", from the Matanikau towards the southern portion of the U.S. Lunga perimeter. The long trail went across rivers and streams, deep ravines, steep ridges, and thick jungle. 
Between 16 and 18 October, the 2nd Division began their march along the Maruyama Road.
By 23 October, Maruyama's forces were finding it hard to get through the jungle to reach the American forces. Hyakutake delayed the attack to 19:00 on 24 October. The Americans did not know that Maruyama's forces were on their way.
Sumiyoshi was told by Hyakutake's staff of the delay of the attack to 24 October. However, he was unable to contact his troops to tell them of the delay. Thus, at dusk on 23 October, two battalions of the 4th Infantry Regiment and the nine tanks of the 1st Independent Tank Company attacked on the U.S. Marine defenses at the mouth of the Matanikau.
U.S. Marine artillery, cannon, and rifle fire defeated the attacks, destroying all the tanks and killing many of the Japanese soldiers. Only a small number of Marines were killed or wounded.
Finally, late on 24 October Maruyama's forces reached the U.S. Lunga perimeter. Over two nights Maruyama's troops attacked positions defended by troops of the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines under Lieutenant Colonel Chesty Puller and the U.S. Army's 3rd Battalion, 164th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Hall.
U.S. Marine and Army units armed with rifles, machine guns, mortars, and fire from 37 mm anti-tank guns did terrible damage to the Japanese. A few small groups of Japanese that broke through the American defenses, were all killed over the next several days.
More than 1,500 of Maruyama's troops were killed in the attacks while the Americans lost about 60 killed. Over the same two days American aircraft from Henderson Field destroying 14 Japanese aircraft and sunk a light cruiser.
Further Japanese attacks near the Matanikau on 26 October were also defeated with heavy losses for the Japanese. As a result, by 08:00 on 26 October, Hyakutake stopped the attacks and ordered his forces to retreat. About half of Maruyama's survivors were ordered to retreat back to the Matanikau Valley. The 230th Infantry Regiment under Colonel Toshinari Shōji was told to go to Koli Point, east of the Lunga perimeter.
Soldiers from the 2nd Division reached the 17th Army headquarters area at Kokumbona, west of the Matanikau on 4 November. Shoji's unit reached Koli Point and made a camp. The 2nd Division had many battle deaths, combat injuries, malnutrition, and tropical diseases. It was too weak to do any more attacks. It fought as a defensive force along the coast for the rest of the battle.
The Japanese lost 2,200 – 3,000 troops in the battle while the Americans lost around 80 killed.
Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands.
At the same time that Hyakutake's troops were attacking the Lunga perimeter, Japanese aircraft carriers and other large warships led by Isoroku Yamamoto moved near the southern Solomon Islands. From this location, the Japanese naval forces hoped to defeat any Allied (primarily U.S.) naval forces, especially carrier forces. Allied naval carrier forces in the area, now under the command of William Halsey, Jr., also hoped to meet the Japanese naval forces in battle.
Nimitz had replaced Ghormley with Halsey on 18 October after deciding that Ghormley had become too negative to lead Allied forces in the South Pacific area.
The two opposing carrier forces battled each other on the morning of 26 October, in what became known as the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. Each side sent carrier air attacks. Allied ships had to retreat from the battle after one carrier was sunk () and another () heavily damaged. The Japanese carrier forces, however, also pulled back because of high aircraft and aircrew losses and major damage to two carriers.
The Japanese were the winners in terms of ships sunk and damaged. However, the loss by the Japanese of many experienced aircrews helped the Allies, who did not lose many aircrew. The Japanese carriers did not have any more important roles in the battle.
November land actions.
To strengthen his victory in the Battle for Henderson Field, Vandegrift sent six Marine battalions, later joined by one U.S. Army battalion, on an attack west of the Matanikau. The attack was commanded by Merritt Edson and its goal was to capture Kokumbona, headquarters of the 17th Army, west of Point Cruz.
Defending the Point Cruz area were Japanese army troops from the 4th Infantry Regiment commanded by Nomasu Nakaguma. The 4th Infantry was in poor condition because of battle deaths and injuries, tropical disease, and malnutrition.
The American attack began on 1 November. It destroyed Japanese forces defending the Point Cruz area by 3 November. The Americans seemed to be close to capturing Kokumbona. Then American forces found newly landed Japanese troops near Koli Point on the eastern side of the Lunga perimeter.
To deal with these newly landed Japanese troops, Vandegrift stopped the Matanikau attack on 4 November. The Americans had 71 deaths and the Japanese around 400 killed.
At Koli Point early in the morning 3 November, five Japanese destroyers delivered 300 army troops. They were sent to help Shōji and his troops who were going to Koli Point after the Battle for Henderson Field.
When Vandegrift found out about the Japanese landing, he sent a battalion of Marines under Herman H. Hanneken to attack the Japanese at Koli. Soon after landing, the Japanese soldiers pushed Hanneken's battalion back towards the Lunga perimeter.
In response, Vandegrift ordered Puller's Marine battalion plus two of the 164th infantry battalions, along with Hanneken's battalion, to attack the Japanese forces there.
As the American troops began to move, Shōji and his soldiers began to arrive at Koli Point. Beginning on 8 November, the American troops tried to surround Shōji's forces at Gavaga Creek near Koli Point.
Hyakutake ordered Shōji to leave his positions at Koli and rejoin Japanese forces at Kokumbona in the Matanikau area. Between 9 and 11 November, Shōji and between 2,000 and 3,000 of his men escaped into the jungle to the south. On 12 November, the Americans killed all the remaining Japanese soldiers. The Americans counted the bodies of 450–475 Japanese dead in the Koli Point area and captured most of Shōji's heavy weapons and supplies. The American forces had 40 killed and 120 wounded in the attack.
On 4 November, two companies from the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Evans Carlson landed by boat at Aola Bay, east of Lunga Point. Carlson's raiders, along with troops from the U.S. Army's 147th Infantry Regiment, were told to protect 500 Seabees as they constructed an airfield at that location. Halsey had agreed with the plan to build an airfield at Aola Bay.
The Aola airfield construction was stopped at the end of November because the land was not good for building an airfield.
On 5 November, Vandegrift ordered Carlson to attack any of Shōji's forces that had escaped from Koli Point. Carlson and his troops did a 29-day patrol from Aola to the Lunga perimeter. During the patrol, Carlson's soldierz fought several battles with Shōji's retreating forces, killing almost 500 of them, while having 16 killed themselves.
In addition to the deaths from attacks by Carlson's raiders, tropical diseases and a lack of food caused more of Shōji's men to die. By the time Shōji's forces reached the Lunga River in mid-November, about halfway to the Matanikau, only 1,300 men remained. When Shōji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau, only 700 to 800 survivors were still with him. Most of the survivors from Shōji's force joined other Japanese units defending the Mount Austen and upper Matanikau River area.
Japanese destroyer trips on 5, 7 and 9 November, delivered additional troops from the Japanese 38th Infantry Division, including most of the 228th Infantry Regiment to Guadalcanal. These fresh troops were put in the Point Cruz and Matanikau area, and they stopped attacks by American forces on 10 and 18 November. The Americans and Japanese remained facing each other along a line west of Point Cruz for the next six weeks.
Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.
After the defeat in the Battle for Henderson Field, the IJA planned to try again to capture the airfield in November 1942. They needed new soldiers before the attack could start. The IJA requested help from Yamamoto to deliver the new troops to the island and to support the next attack.
Yamamoto provided 11 large transport ships to carry the remaining 7,000 troops from the 38th Infantry Division, their ammunition, food, and heavy equipment from Rabaul to Guadalcanal. He also provided a warship force that included two battleships. The two battleships, and , with special fragmentation shells, were to bomb Henderson Field on the night of 12–13 November and destroy it and the aircraft stationed there. This would allow the slow, heavy transports to reach Guadalcanal and unload safely the next day. The warship force was commanded from "Hiei" by recently promoted Vice Admiral Hiroaki Abe.
In early November, Allied forces learned that the Japanese were preparing again to try to capture Henderson Field. Therefore, the U.S. sent Task Force 67, a convoy carrying Marines, two U.S. Army infantry battalions, and ammunition and food to Guadalcanal on 11 November. The supply ships were protected by two task groups, commanded by Rear Admirals Daniel J. Callaghan and Norman Scott, and aircraft from Henderson Field. The ships were attacked several times on 11 and 12 November by Japanese aircraft but most were unloaded without serious damage.
U.S. aircraft spotted the approach of Abe's bombing force and warned the Allied command. Turner sent all usable combat ships under Callaghan to protect the troops ashore from the expected Japanese naval attack and troop landing. He also ordered the supply ships at Guadalcanal to leave by early evening 12 November. Callaghan's force comprised two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, and eight destroyers.
Around 01:30 on 13 November, Callaghan's force met Abe's bombing group between Guadalcanal and Savo Island. In addition to the two battleships, Abe's force included one light cruiser and 11 destroyers. In darkness, the two warship forces opened fire. Abe's warships sank or severely damaged all but one cruiser and one destroyer in Callaghan's force and both Callaghan and Scott were killed.
Two Japanese destroyers were sunk and another destroyer and "Hiei" was heavily damaged. In spite of his defeat of Callaghan's force, Abe ordered his warships to pull back without bombing Henderson Field. "Hiei" sank later that day after air attacks by CAF aircraft and aircraft from the U.S. carrier . Because of Abe's failure to destroyHenderson Field, Yamamoto ordered the troop transport convoy to wait an additional day before heading towards Guadalcanal.
Yamamoto ordered Nobutake Kondō to assemble another bombing force using warships from Truk and Abe's force to attack Henderson Field on 15 November.
At 02:00 on 14 November, a cruiser and destroyer force under Gunichi Mikawa bombed Henderson Field. The bombing caused some damage but failed to destroy airfield or most of its aircraft. As Mikawa's force went back to Rabaul, Tanaka's transport convoy, thinking that Henderson Field was now destroyed began its trip towards Guadalcanal.
Throughout 14 November, aircraft from Henderson Field and "Enterprise" attacked Mikawa's and Tanaka's ships, sinking one heavy cruiser and seven of the transports. Most of the troops were rescued from the transports by Tanaka's escorting destroyers and returned to the Shortlands. After dark, Tanaka and the remaining four transports continued towards Guadalcanal as Kondo's force approached to bomb Henderson Field.
In order to attack Kondo's force, Halsey, who was low on undamaged ships, sent two battleships, and , and four destroyers from the "Enterprise" task force. The U.S. force, under the command of Willis A. Lee aboard "Washington", reached Guadalcanal and Savo Island just before midnight on 14 November, shortly before Kondo's bombing force arrived.
Kondo's force consisted of "Kirishima" plus two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and nine destroyers. After the two forces met, Kondo's force quickly sank three of the U.S. destroyers and heavily damaged the fourth. The Japanese warships then damaged "South Dakota". As Kondo's warships concentrated on "South Dakota", "Washington" approached the Japanese ships and opened fire on "Kirishima", hitting the Japanese battleship and causing serious damage. After chasing "Washington" towards the Russell Islands, Kondo ordered his warships to pull back without bombing Henderson Field. One of Kondo's destroyers was also sunk during the battle.
As Kondo's ships pulled back, the four Japanese transports landed near Tassafaronga on Guadalcanal at 04:00 and began unloading. At 05:55, U.S. aircraft and artillery began attacking the transports, destroying all four transports along with most of the supplies that they carried.
Only 2,000–3,000 of the army troops made it ashore. Because of the failure to deliver most of the troops and supplies, the Japanese were forced to cancel their planned November attack on Henderson Field.
On 26 November, Japanese Lieutenant General Hitoshi Imamura took command of the newly formed Eighth Area Army at Rabaul. The new command included both Hyakutake's 17th Army and the 18th Army in New Guinea.
One of Imamura's first goals was to retake Henderson Field and Guadalcanal. The Allied offensive at Buna in New Guinea, however, changed Imamura's goals.
Because the Allied attempt to take Buna was considered a more severe threat to Rabaul, Imamura delayed sending new troops to Guadalcanal to concentrate on the situation in New Guinea.
Battle of Tassafaronga.
The Japanese continued to have problems in delivering enough supplies to their troops on Guadalcanal. Attempts to use only submarines the last two weeks in November did not provide enough food for Hyakutake's forces.
A separate attempt to establish bases in the central Solomons to use to send barge convoys to Guadalcanal also failed because of Allied air attacks. On 26 November, the 17th Army told Imamura that it lacked food. Some front-line units had not been supplied for six days . This forced the Japanese to return to using destroyers to deliver the necessary supplies.
Eighth Fleet sailors thought of a plan to help reduce the time that destroyers delivering supplies to Guadalcanal were exposed to Allied attack. Large oil or gas drums filled with medical supplies and food and strung together with rope. When the destroyers arrived at Guadalcanal they would cut loose the drums and a boat from shore could pick up the rope.
The Eighth Fleet's Guadalcanal Reinforcement Unit (the Tokyo Express) was told to make five deliveries to Tassafaronga on Guadalcanal using the drum method on the night of 30 November. Tanaka's unit had eight destroyers, with six destroyers carrying 200 to 240 drums of supplies each.
When Halsey learned about the Japanese supply attempt, he ordered the newly formed Task Force 67, which had four cruisers and four destroyers under the command of U.S. Rear Admiral Carleton H. Wright, to attack Tanaka's force off Guadalcanal. Two additional destroyers joined Wright's force during the day of 30 November.
At 22:40 on 30 November, Tanaka's force arrived off Guadalcanal and prepared to unload the supply barrels. Meanwhile, Wright's warships were approaching from the opposite direction. Wright's destroyers detected Tanaka's force on radar and the commander requested permission to attack with torpedoes. Wright waited four minutes before giving permission.
This allowed Tanaka's force to escape from being torpedoed. All of the American torpedoes missed their targets. At the same time, Wright's cruisers opened fire, hitting and destroying one of the Japanese destroyers. The rest of Tanaka's warships abandoned the supply mission, turned, and launched 44 torpedoes in the direction of Wright's cruisers.
The Japanese torpedoes hit and sank the U.S. cruiser and heavily damaged the cruisers , , and . The rest of Tanaka's destroyers escaped without damage, but failed to deliver any of the supplies to Guadalcanal.
By 7 December 1942, Hyakutake's forces were losing about 50 men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. Further attempts by Tanaka's destroyer forces to deliver supplies on 3 December 7 December, and 11 December, did not solve the supply problem. One of Tanaka's destroyers was sunk by a U.S. PT boat torpedo.
Japanese decision to withdraw.
On 12 December, the Japanese Navy thought about abandoning Guadalcanal. At the same time, several army staff officers at the Imperial General Headquarters (IGH) said retaking Guadalcanal would be impossible. A group led by IJA Colonel Joichiro Sanada, chief of the IGH's operations section, visited Rabaul on 19 December and talked to Imamura and his staff.
When this group returned to Tokyo, Sanada recommended that Guadalcanal be abandoned. The IGH's top leaders agreed with Sanada's recommendation on 26 December. They ordered their staff to plan for a withdrawal from Guadalcanal. A new defense line would be set up in the central Solomons, and soldiers and weapons could be sent to the campaign in New Guinea.
On 28 December, General Hajime Sugiyama and Admiral Osami Nagano told Emperor Hirohito of the decision to withdraw from Guadalcanal. On 31 December, the Emperor agreed with the decision. The Japanese secretly began to prepare for the evacuation, called Operation Ke, scheduled to begin during January 1943.
Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse.
By December, the tired 1st Marine Division was brought back for a rest, and over the next month the U.S. XIV Corps took over operations on the island. This corps consisted of the 2nd Marine Division and the U.S. Army's 25th Infantry and Americal Divisions. U.S. Army Major General Alexander Patch replaced Vandegrift as commander of Allied forces on Guadalcanal. By January this was over 50,000 men.
On 18 December, Allied (mainly U.S. Army) forces began attacking Japanese soldiers on Mount Austen. A strong Japanese fort, called the Gifu, made the attacks hard and the Americans had to stop their attacks on 4 January.
The Allies attacking the Japanese on 10 January on Mount Austen. They also attacked two nearby ridges called the Seahorse and the Galloping Horse. The Allies captured all three by 23 January. At the same time, U.S. Marines advanced along the north coast of the island. The Americans lost about 250 killed in the operation while the Japanese suffered around 3,000 killed–about 12 to 1 in the Americans' favor.
"Ke" evacuation.
On 14 January, destroyers delivered troops to guard the "Ke" evacuation. Japanese warships and aircraft moved around the Rabaul and Bougainville areas in preparation to withdraw their troops. Allied forces detected the Japanese movements, but thought they were another attempt to retake Henderson Field and Guadalcanal.
Patch, afraid of another Japanese attack, sent only a small portion of his troops to continue an attack against Hyakutake's forces. On 29 January, Halsey sent a resupply convoy to Guadalcanal protected by a cruiser task force. Sighting the cruiser task force, Japanese naval torpedo bombers attacked the task force and heavily damaged the U.S. cruiser . The next day, more torpedo aircraft attacked and sank "Chicago".
Halsey ordered the remainder of the task force to return to base and directed the rest of his naval forces to take station in the Coral Sea, south of Guadalcanal, to be ready to respond to a Japanese attack.
The Japanese 17th Army withdrew to the west coast of Guadalcanal while rear guard groups stopped the American attacks. On the night of February 1, 20 destroyers from Mikawa's 8th Fleet under Shintaro Hashimoto removed 4,935 soldiers, mainly from the 38th Division, from the island. The Japanese and the Americans each lost a destroyer from air and naval attacks.
On the nights of 4 and 7 February, Hashimoto and his destroyers completed the removal of most of the remaining Japanese forces from Guadalcanal. Apart from some air attacks, Allied forces did not try to stop Hashimoto's efforts to withdraw his troops. In total, the Japanese removed 10,652 men from Guadalcanal. On 9 February, Patch realized that the Japanese were gone and declared Guadalcanal secure for Allied forces, ending the battle.
Aftermath.
After the Japanese withdrawal, Guadalcanal and Tulagi were developed into major bases. These bases supported the Allied advance further up the Solomon Islands chain. In addition to Henderson Field, two additional fighter runways were constructed at Lunga Point and a bomber airfield was built at Koli Point.
Naval ports were built at Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida. The anchorage around Tulagi became an important base for Allied warships and transport ships supporting the Solomon Islands campaign. Major ground units stayed in camps on Guadalcanal before being sent further up the Solomons.
After Guadalcanal the Japanese were having to defend themselves in the Pacific. The efforts to send new troops to Guadalcanal had weakened Japanese efforts in other areas. This helped the Australian and American attack in New Guinea to be successful. This led to the capture of the bases of Buna and Gona in early 1943.
In June, the Allies launched Operation Cartwheel, which aimed to cut off Rabaul and the forces centered there. This helped the South West Pacific campaign under General Douglas MacArthur. It also helped the Central Pacific island hopping campaign under Admiral Chester Nimitz. Both efforts got the Allies closer to Japan. The remaining Japanese defenses in the South Pacific area were destroyed or bypassed by Allied forces.
Significance.
Resources.
The Battle of Guadalcanal was one of the first long battles in the Pacific, alongside the Solomon Islands campaign. Both battles were very hard to organize for both of the nations involved. For the U.S., it had to learn how to do combat air transport. A failure to achieve air superiority forced Japan to get new troops in by barges, destroyers, and submarines, which did not work that well.
Early in the battle, the Americans lacked resources, as they lost cruisers and carriers. It took months for replacement ships to be finished.
The U.S. Navy suffered such high losses during the campaign that it refused to release total casualty figures for years. However, as the campaign continued, and the American public became more and more aware of the heroism of the American forces on Guadalcanal, more forces were sent to the area.
This was a problem for Japan as its military-industrial complex was unable to produce as much as the Americans. Thus, as the battles continued, the Japanese were losing equipment they could not replace while the Americans were replacing and even adding to their forces.
The Guadalcanal battles made Japan lose a lot of equipment and soldiers. About 25,000 experienced troops were killed during the battles. These losses meant that Japan could not achieve its goals in the New Guinea campaign. Japan also lost control of the southern Solomons and the ability to stop Allied shipping to Australia.
Japan's major base at Rabaul was threatened by Allied air power. Japanese land, air, and naval forces had been lost. The Japanese could not replace the aircraft and ships destroyed and sunk in these battles. Nor could they replace their highly trained and veteran crews, especially the naval aircrews, nearly as quickly as the Allies.
Strategic.
After the victory at the Battle of Midway America was able to have naval strength in the Pacific equal to Japan's. It was only after the Allied victories in Guadalcanal and New Guinea that the Japanese attacks ended. The Guadalcanal Campaign ended all Japanese expansion attempts and placed the Allies in a position of power. This Allied victory was the first step in a winning other battles that eventually led to the surrender of Japan and the occupation of the Japanese home islands.
The "Europe first" policy of the United States had at first meant they only defended against Japanese expansion, to focus resources on defeating Germany. However, Admiral King's argument for the Guadalcanal invasion, convinced President Franklin D. Roosevelt that the Pacific War could be won as well. By the end of 1942, it was clear that Japan had lost the Guadalcanal campaign. This was very bad for Japan's plans for defending their empire.
The military victory for the Allies was important. The psychological victory was also important. The Allies had beaten Japan's best land, air, and warship forces. After Guadalcanal, Allied personnel regarded the Japanese military with much less fear than previously. In addition, the Allies began to think they could win the Pacific War.
Tokyo Express no longer has terminus on Guadalcanal."—Major General Alexander Patch, USACommander, U.S. Forces on Guadalcanal" 
Guadalcanal is no longer merely a name of an island in Japanese military history. It is the name of the graveyard of the Japanese army."—Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi, IJACommander, 35th Infantry Brigade at Guadalcanal" 
Beyond Kawaguchi, several Japanese 
political and military leaders, including Naoki Hoshino, Osami Nagano, and Torashirō Kawabe, stated after the war that Guadalcanal was the turning point in the conflict.

Happy Tree Friends is an American adult animated web series. It had achieved a cult following on YouTube. Montijo, Navarro, Graff, Ankrum also serve as the as showrunners.
Despite the childlike art style of the series and having a colorful cast of characters, the show would often have the animals go through very violent situations, complete with detailed gore. These twists happen during each episode, which was met with surprised and positive reactions and reviews. The portrayal of death in "Happy Tree Friends" is usually very extreme and anatomically correct, the special effects are oftem more vivid and of exaggerated detail.
The official music videos are comparable to that of "Nirvana" (the short cartoon featured on their song "Smells Like Teen Spirit"), Soundgarden, Alice in Chains and Pearl Jam. The series is also referenced in the music video "Carpal Tunnel of Love" by rock band Fall Out Boy, in which the members are designed like the animal characters by the webseries' staff. The band members end up dying in the music video by a tow cable.
The program has little to no speech. When the characters do speak, their words are severely garbled. It is easy to tell what each character's reaction is, but their words are very hard to understand. According to its website, the idea for "Happy Tree Friends" was created by Rhode Montijo when he drew a yellow volkswagen rabbit, that may have evolved into the character of Cuddles, on a piece of paper and wrote "Resistance Is Futile" underneath it. 
A "Happy Tree Friends" spin-off called "Ka-Pow!" premiered on September 2, 2008. One of the characters was also featured in a video titled "YouTube Copyright School", which curiously enough is not intended to be as twisted and gory.

Mound Builder is a general term referring to certain cultures of pre-Columbian American Indians. These cultures built various styles of earthen mounds. There were burial, residential and ceremonial purposes. The cultures cover a long period of time. This is from about 3500 BCE to the 16th century CE. This includes the Archaic, Woodland and Mississippian periods. Notable cultures were the Adena, Hopewell, Plaquemine, Fort Ancient, Coles Creek and Mississippian cultures. These groups were around the Great Lakes, the Ohio River Valley, and the Mississippi River.
The mounds were flat structures with layers. They usually were pyramids. Some mounds were like domes. Some mounds were effigy mounds. They had shapes of animals. One famous one is the Serpent Mound in Ohio. The oldest mound is probably the Watson Brake in Louisiana. Usually, elite made workers build the mounds. Some mounds were burial sites for elite people of the tribes. 
There were several records of these mounds. Hernando de Soto was one of the earliest to see and record these mounds. The French artist Jacques le Moyne made paintings of these mounds. All of the mounds today are from the Woodland and Mississippian periods. 
The mounds started to disappear with colonization. Disease decreased the population sizes of American Indians. Mound building ended after the 17th century.

The Seven Cities of Gold is a legend from the Spanish conquest of South America. It led to several expeditions by adventurers and conquistador during the 16th century. The legend originated in New Spain, about the lost cities of Quivira and Cíbola.
The location of the golden cities appear to have been in the mountains (Cibola) of the Inca. Quivira was the location of the fabulous source of mineral wealth but it was located in Kansas and it was the Flint fire stone (Quay-Vi-ra). Well known to the Indians of North America but not the gold the Spanish lusted for. 
Now famous as the Flint Hills of Kansas.

Alexandra is a work by the Greek poet Lykophron, who is only known through this work. It was written between 196 and 190 BC. The work has 1474 lines, which are done in jambic trimeters. This is what most Greek tragedies were written in. 
Story.
Paris left for Sparta, to abduct Helena, the wife of Menelaos. This was going to cause the Trojan War. Kassandra is left in the temple, guarded by someone instructed by Priamos, her father. The text is the report this guard gives to Priamos, about what Kassandra had said. 
Kassandra (named ALexandra) first recalls how Herakles destroyed Troy. She then tells about the Trojan War. A large central part is devoted to how the Greek heroes return home. She tells about Odysseus, his travels, and how he went home to his wife Penelope. Penelope later kills him. Kassandra also tells how Aeneas successfully settled in Rome, and how Rome became a big empire. The final part of the poem is devoted to the "eternal war" between Europe and Asia, about the Persian Wars and Alexander the Great. Kassandra says that six generations after him, a relative will win over the Macendonians, which will end the warring. Kassandra's speech ends with resignation, as she cannot stop the events. The guard ends his speech with a blessing for the Trojans.
Language.
The dark language of the poem comes from its vocabulary, its use of special, and old forms of words. Of about 3000 words of the poem, 518 words are only known from this poem, 117 occur in this poem for the first time. The main problems with this poem are that the persons are usually not named. Rather they are described with what they did. Geographical places are similarly unnamed, and only described using places in them. Many scholars have tried to identify places and people, in some cases this is no longer possible though. 

Lethwei (; : ) or Burmese boxing is a full contact combat sport from Myanmar. Lethwei is considered to be one of the most brutal martial arts in the world, because headbutts are permitted and the fights are done bareknuckle (without gloves).
Definition.
This famous method of fighting with the bareknuckle hands and with the uncovered feet came in the 3rd century when the monks had wanted to be trained and to defended themselves. It is a boxing "called martial" that borrows from the Burmese warriors all their array of particular plans for gaining success in the combat. It had come popular beginning of the 11th century under the king Anawratha, with combats among tribes with no rules and with a violence without common measure. The way of facing is special very much, much often taking a certain animal behaviour and is alike only of much distant to other Eastern methods.
Rules.
In the way received from ancestors, the combat is judged by two referees and is done in a circle where every form of the blow and of the throw is permitted. The present time brought the rules as if the Eastern boxing, especially the gloves, the things that keep safe, the rounds and the ring. The technical part of the person who fights is much wide and the behaviours are produced by other methods of the combat de Burma. Many unusually interesting actions are happened, especially the flying techniques (jumping kick, knee strike and with elbow in flying), and techniques in walking of stairs (kicks and knee strike). In the past, a traditional Burmese Boxing was quite different from Thaing, for its brutal and rough side. Today, is not so, because is having good organization under the modern conditions, can be agradable see.
Technical Description : "The Entire Body is a Weapon".
Nine traditional techniques are the parts of the method of the Burmese boxing. The technical description of the lethwei include three main parts, the weapons which are used, the goals which are aims and the distances of the combat. We meet: 
From a point of view of particular plan for gaining succes in the combat, and in order to learn and remember, a part of laws is established. For example, we meet the following laws: 
The Cultural Part of Lethwei.
According to a customary way, the combat is performed in a circle. In the Burmese villages, still in 21st century, this fight has kept in existence its character received from ancestors. Only the appearance of an Eastern ring and of the divisions seems to be mark of the present times.
The match is judged by two referees, in order to can better separate the men who take part in it, and six referees give a points to these men. All the techniques are permitted, a man can be hit in the ground. The boxers fight during the rounds much long. The rounds are changed by complete half-times during the other matches are performed.
The set of needed things is poor, the competitor uses certain pants of boxing, wrapped hands, coconut as a something that keeps the genitals safe, leather strap among the teeth. Till the present times, many Burmese boxers have the tattooed trunk and the leg. In a certain, you can see his victories, in other - the representations of animals (eagle, serpent, leopard, tiger, etc..) suggesting force and being brave.
Lethwei yay.

John (Jack) Peisley (1835 – 1862) Australian bushranger was born in Bathurst New South Wales in 1835. He is believed to be the first bushranger born in Australia. His name is often found spelled as "Piesley".
Early life.
John Peisley lived in the Abercrombie District with his well-known settler parents Thomas and Elizabeth. Their house was reputed a den of thieves. John Peisley was arrested in his teens for stealing. About 1840, the extended family of ticket of leave convicts Thomas Weavers and wife Sarah, previously Smith née Lake crossed the Blue Mountains to Bathurst and took up farming in the Mount Macquarie area where unofficial settlement started in 1821.  The first land grant was to Thomas Icely for "Coombing Park" in 1829.  Nearby land was taken up on Coombing and Fell Tree Creeks, and at Number One Swamp that developed into the village of Mount Macquarie, the latter renamed Neville in 1888. Thomas Weavers and stepson William Smith took up land together. On 12 May 1851, two horses missing from Thomas Weavers’ Mount Macquarie property were seen in the possession of seventeen-year-old John Peisley driving them and five more to the Abercrombie. He was arrested on warrant and indicted for stealing. The jury could not agree the identity of horses were sufficiently established and acquitted the accused, but he was remanded in custody, as he faced another charge of horse stealing. 
Convict.
Not all Australian convicts and ticket of leave holders arrived in Australia on convict transports. Bathurst-born Colonial lad John Peisley was eventually convicted of stealing cattle and sentenced to serve time on Cockatoo Island near Sydney, now called Biloela. A prisoner who served time there was labelled a "Cockatoo Hand". There he met "Darkie" Frank Clark, who as Frank Christie, escapee from Melbourne’s Pentridge gaol in 1850 after serving five weeks of a five year sentence. In New South Wales, Clark turned to horse and cattle stealing in company with William Fogg. Convicted, he got seven years for attempting to sell stolen horses and forging horse ownership papers at Yass.
Clark, having served less than six years of his sentence, was given his ticket of leave on 
31 December 1859, conditional he stayed in the Carcoar District. At Carcoar, he worked for a butcher. Two months later, he absconded to new gold diggings at Kiandra and calling himself Frank Gardiner opened a butcher’s shop selling carcasses of stolen cattle. His true identity was soon realized and warrants issued. He was arrested in May 1861, but skipped bail at Lambing Flat (now Young). He teamed up with Canadian immigrant John Gilbert and reverted to full-time crime.
Bushranger.
In December 1860, convict Peisley gained his Ticket of Leave at Scone, conditional upon him remaining in the Hunter River Valley. On 23 March 1861, fifty miles north-east of Bathurst, between Louisa Creek and Tambaroora, with fellow Cockatoo Hand named McKenzie, he robbed travelling bank officer Richard Cox Shaw carrying £565 in notes, also some gold and silver coins. Earlier bushrangers were mostly transported convicts; colony-born Peisley became the first true "Wild Colonial Boy". The robbers split and Peisley absconded to the Abercrombie Ranges he knew well. In May, at Fish River in Fogg’s ironbark slab humpy, six miles from Bigga, Peisley and Frank Clark reunited and teamed with John Gilbert as highway robbers, ‘sticking up’ travellers in the area between Bathurst, Lambing Flat, Gundagai and Yass. On 16 July morning, Sergeant John Middleton and Trooper William Hosie stationed at Tuena, descended upon Fogg’s humpy occupied by Fogg, his wife and children, Frank Clark armed with a six-shot revolver handgun, and Jim Barney, an old man. Unknown to the troopers, Peisley and Gilbert were camped one mile away. Called to surrender, Clark shot Middleton three times, in the hand, mouth and hip, and Trooper William Hosie received a glancing ball to his forehead. Clark was also wounded. They wrestled before Clark gave up and was manacled. Barney took off to warn Peisley and Gilbert. Middleton left for Bigga to get help and reinforcements. Circumstances of Hosie leaving for Bigga were disputed. Fogg claimed Hosie accepted fifty sovereigns to release Clark and to say he escaped. Hosie averred at Fogg’s trial for obstructing police, while he and Fogg escorted the prisoner along the road to Bigga, Clark escaped when bushrangers Peisley and another (Gilbert) waylaid them. Trooper Hosie reached Bigga alone mid-afternoon. Weak and delirious from loss of blood, Sergeant Middleton arrived at nightfall. Both would later recover. Reports of Crime issued July and August 1861 declared £120 rewards, £20 for Clark’s apprehension, and £50 for Peisley’s, and further sum of £50 by Government for such information as shall lead to the conviction of those concerned in the outrage of attacking and wounding the Patrol with Firearms in the Bathurst District. The report disclosed:
"On the 16th July, Sergeant Middleton and Trooper Hosie, of the Western Patrol, were attacked and severely wounded at the Fish River, by Francis Clarke, alias Jones, alias Christie, a Ticket of Leave holder, illegally at large from his district; a native of Goulbourn, New South Wales, 31 years ... wounded in the affray on left temple by a pistol-ball or whip. He was captured and afterwards released by two armed men: John Peisley, a Ticket of Leave holder, illegally at large from his district; a native of Bathurst, New South Wales, about 26, 5 feet 8 1⁄2 inches high, ruddy complexion, flaxen hair, bluish-grey eyes, long featured, pock-marked nose, several scars, arms and legs hairy, left eye spasmodic winking action... The other man is about 26 years"
The report also included weapons carried and comprehensive physical descriptions, normal clothing and by Clark (Gardiner) and Gilbert (not named). 
Displeased with ill-fame attributed him, Peisley wrote the editor of the Bathurst Free Press and Mining Journal by letter dated “Fish River, 4th September, 1861.” It stated, in part:
"You will no doubt be surprised to receive a note from the (now by all account) noted Piesley; but, Sir, through your valuable paper I must make it known that, if it be my lot to be taken, whether dead or alive, I will never be tried for the rescue of Gardiner, in the light in which it is presented; nor did I ever fire at Trooper Hosie. ... I must be the Invisible Prince to commit one-tenth of what is laid to my charge. I trust I may never have to allude to this again. I love my native hills, I love freedom and detest cruelty to man or beast. Trusting you will publish this, my bold letter no doubt, but you can be assured it comes from the real John Piesley, and not any of his many representatives. I am, Mr. Editor, your much harassed writer, JOHN PIESLEY"
In the next months Clark, then more often called Gardiner, Peisley and Gilbert bushranged and retreated to the Weddin Mountains near Forbes and Cowra. Peisley separated from the gang and single-handed held up the Lambing Flat coach after it left Cowra. He then returned to Abercrombie District.
Murder.
On 27 December 1861, Peisley went to Tom McGuinness’s inn at Bigga and left the next day with fellow drinker James Wilson, stocked with wine and brandy. They rode to a nearby farm owned by William and Stephen Benyon and continued drinking and arguing with the two brothers. He accused, 17 years earlier, when he was a kid, William had swapped a horse with him, which was no good. A fight erupted and Wilson took Peisley’s revolvers, which William’s wife Martha hid in the garden. At her husband’s insistence, she returned the revolvers. Peisley pursued Stephen Benyon to the barn followed by William Benyon. Both brothers were shot by Peisley; Stephen in the arm and William in the throat; witnessed by Martha Benyon, Wilson, farmhand George Harmer, servant girl Mary Samson and Thomas Weavers. 
Doctor Henry Kowland attended William Benyon the following day, and found a bullet had passed through his windpipe and lodged in the spine, paralyzing him from the neck down. He could not remove the bullet and considered the case hopeless from the start. He attended him again on 31 December, three days before he died. 
Capture and demise.
A warrant issued for Peisley’s arrest for the murder of Benyon and reward for information as would lead to his apprehension and conviction. An announcement in the Government Gazette of January 1862, after the murder of Benyon, based on Report of Crime dated 29 July 1861, described Peisley:
"About 28 years of age, about 5 ft 10 in. high, stout, well made, fresh complexion, very small light whiskers, quite bald on top of head and forehead, several recent marks on face, and a mark from a blow of a spade on top of head; puffed and dissipated-looking from hard drinking, invariable wears fashionable Napoleon boots, dark cloth breeches, dark vest buttoned up the front, large albert gold guard, cabbage-tree hat and duck coat. Sometimes wears a dark wig and always carries a brace of revolvers."
On 15 January, Constables Morris, Murphy and Simpson were searching the Abercrombie area for bushrangers and spoke with Peisley near Bigga. Police gave chase but Peisley’s superior horse enabled him to escape easily. He was identified and challenged by Corporal Carroll at Tarcutta on 29 January, and again escaped on his well-bred mount. One week later, after a struggle, Peisley was captured and secured near Bootes’s hotel, Mundarlo by Mr Mackenzie and Mr Beveridge of Wantabadgerie, who delivered him to Gundagai. At his committal before the Carcoar bench, Peisley called Thomas Weavers, but he corroborated the prosecution witnesses. Committed for trail, Peisley handcuffed and chained, was taken from Carcoar to Bathurst by a large posse of armed police.
He was tried and convicted in the Bathurst Court on 14 March 1862, for the murder of William Benyon and sentenced to death. He was hanged on 25 April 1862, in the Bathurst Gaol before about fifty people. Aboriginal Jackey Bullfrog was hanged at the same time for murdering William Clarke. At the gallows, Peisley pleaded he had a drunken fight, and death was Benyon’s fault as much as his. He averred he had he had nothing to do with Gardiner’s rescue, was nowhere near Fogg’s when he got away, and nothing to do with any attempt bribe Hosie. His last words were “Goodbye gentlemen, and God bless you.” Clark using the name Christie was captured at Appis Creek, Queensland in March 1864. He served ten years of a cumulative 32-year sentence for twice wounding Trooper Hosie, with intent to kill and intent to cause harm and two counts of armed robbery. 
Before and after Piesley’s hanging, John Gilbert teamed up with Ben Hall. Bushranging robberies by the end of 1864 were so troublesome that the Parliament of New South Wales rushed through a Bill, "An Act to facilitate the taking or apprehending of persons charged with certain felonies and the punishment of those by whom they are harboured." Within one month of the Act’s passing on 8 April 1865, Police shot them dead, Hall near Forbes on 6 May and Gilbert at Binalong one week later. Mourners gave them hero status.

Louis Pierre Althusser (Pronunciation: altulseʁ) (October 16, 1918 – October 22, 1990) was a Marxist philosopher. He was born in Algeria. He studied at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. He became Professor of Philosophy there. He taught Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida.
Althusser was a member of the French Communist Party. Sometimes he had bad opinions about the party. He argued against things he thought attacked the basic ideas of Marxism. Some examples are the influence of empiricism on Marxist theory, humanist and reformist socialist orientations in European communist parties, the problem of the 'cult of personality' and ideology. 
Many people say that Althusser is a Structural Marxist. This is a type of Marxism based on structuralism. However, he had many different opinions about structuralism. In 1980, Althusser killed his wife. He went to a psychiatric hospital for three years. He died in 1990.

Last of the Summer Wine is a British sitcom. It ran longer than any other comedy show in the UK and longer than any other sitcom in the world. It airs on the television channel BBC One. Roy Clarke writes the show and Alan J. W. Bell produces and directs it. It started as an episode of the television show "Comedy Playhouse" and originally aired on 4 January 1973. The first series of episodes started airing on 12 November 1973. The show had broadcast its 30th series in 2009 and the 31st and final series was shown in 2010.
"Last of the Summer Wine" was filmed in and around Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England. It features three older men who never get old and act like they are children. The three originally were Norman Clegg (Peter Sallis), Cyril Blamire (Michael Bates), and Compo Simmonite (Bill Owen). After two years, Blamire left the show. In his place, Brian Wilde joined as Foggy Dewhurst. The current cast is Russ Abbot as Hobbo Hobdyke, Burt Kwouk as Entwistle, and Brian Murphy as Alvin Smedley.
Some think the show is not as good as it used to be. Many people continue watching it, though, and praise it for portraying older people well and for its family-friendly humour. Members of the British Royal Family enjoy the show. The show has been nominated for some awards and won the National Television Award for Most Popular Comedy Programme in 1999. There have been many holiday specials, two television movies, and a documentary movie about the series. "Last of the Summer Wine" has inspired other adaptations, including a television prequel, several novelisations, and a stage adaptation.

The ITS 90 is the international temperature scale, published in the year 1990. It mainly is a set of fixed temperatures and instructions how to realise a practical temperature scale, being as close to the thermodynamical temperature scale as current knowledge allows.
History.
The first international temperature scale was established in 1927. An improved version came in 1948. In 1968 the IPTS 68 was issued. Note the letter P, which stands for practical. In 1975 the very low side of the scale (below 1 Kelvin) was added. Since 1990 the ITS 90 is in use.
How it works.
A list of fixed temperatures is given. This list has been produced by national laboratories from all over the world. It has been approved by the B.I.P.M. (Bureau Internationale des Poids et Mesure) in Paris. Temperatures between the fixed points can be measured, using a platinum resistance thermometer (up to 660 °C). This thermometer, however, has to be calibrated first. This is being done at a number of fixed temperatures, covering the desired range. Procedures and formulae for defining an interpolating thermometer are given as well.
An example.
Say we need a calibrated thermometer in the range from room temperature to 400 °C. A triple point of water is to be realised for 0.01 °C. For 231.928 °C there is the freezing point of tin. At 419.527 °C it is the freezing point of zinc, which serves the goal.
After having measured the electrical resistance of this thermometer at the given temperatures, the data is being fed into a prescribed formula, giving the deviation coefficients for the range from 0 to 420 °C. So, from now on we have a thermometer with which we can perform accurate measurements according to the ITS 90.
This type of calibration is called primary calibration. With the thermometer we just calibrated we can perform a secondary calibration. Then another thermometer is to be calibrated against ours. This derived calibration, of course, is a little less accurate, but can take place at any suitable temperature within the range, since our thermometer interpolates between the fixed temperatures.

The Battle of Honey Springs was an American Civil War battle and fought on July 17, 1863. It was an important victory for Union forces in their efforts to gain control of the Indian Territory. The battle was also unique in the fact that white soldiers were the minority in both forces.
Background.
The Confederate commander in the Indian Territory at this time was Douglas H. Cooper. He wanted to capture Fort Gibson, the main Union fort in the territory. If the Confederates captured the fort, they could control the territory. Cooper had to wait along the Elk Creek, near Honey Springs. Cooper had several regiments from Texas in his army. There were several Indian regiments with the Confederates. Cooper needed reinforcements from Arkansas before he attacked the fort.
The Union commander in the terriroty was James G. Blunt. He found out about the Confederates's plans. He decided to attack first. His army had regiments from Kansas, Wisconsin, and Colorado. There were also regiments of Indians in the Union army.
The battle.
The battle started near dawn on July 17. The two armies started fighting north of Elk Creek. The Confederates slowly retreated back to the creek. The Union and Confederate soldiers fought along the creek for several hours. The Confederates started retreating when the center of their line was attacked by the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry.
Aftermath.
Cooper had to burn many of his supplies at Honey Springs to prevent Blunt from capturing them. The Confederates lost 627 casualties. The Union army lost 75 casualties.

The Massif Central is a high region in south-central France. It has mountains and plateaux. It covers 15% of the country. The geological history of the massif is complicated. It is very ancient, and many things have happened to it.
The Massif Central is an ancient massif. It was formed during the Variscan orogeny, consisting mostly of granitic and metamorphic rocks. It looks younger in the East because the Alps uplifted during the Paleogene period. The crystalline base of the Massif is Proterozoic, and so is older than most types of life. 
Many extinct volcanos are there. It has the largest concentration in the world, with 450 volcanos. The Auvergne Volcanoes National Park is in the massif. The Massif is separated from the Alps by the valley of the Rhone.
These departments are usually considered as part of the Massif Central: Allier, Ardèche, Aveyron, Cantal, Corrèze, Creuse, Haute-Loire, Haute-Vienne, Loire, Lot, Lozère, and Puy-de-Dôme.
Mountains.
Here are some well-known mountains in the massif central:

The Massif Central is an important mountain range in France. The Alps, the Pyrénées, and Corsica are higher; Jura, Vosges, Morvan and Ardennes are lower.

Tiktaalik is a genus of extinct fish. This sarcopterygian (lobe-finned) fish from the later Devonian has many features similar to those of tetrapods (four-legged animals).
"Tiktaalik" lived about 375 million years ago. It is part of the transition between fish such as "Panderichthys", known from fossils 380 million years old, and early tetrapods such as "Acanthostega" and "Ichthyostega", known from fossils about 365 million years old. Its mixture of basal fish and derived tetrapod characteristics led one of its discoverers, Neil Shubin, to call "Tiktaalik" a 'fishapod'.
This, and other species like it, prove that legs started to develop before these animals were land-based. They were shallow-water carnivorous fish, or fishapods. "Tiktaalik" was therefore a transitional fossil, and an example of mosaic evolution.

In physics, polarity describes an attribute that can usually have two values:
Chemical polarity is a feature of chemical bonds, where two different atoms in the same molecule have different electronegativity. As a result, the electrons in the bond are not shared equally by the two atoms. This causes an asymmetrical (polar) electric field. Molecular covalent bonds can be described as polar or nonpolar. Entire molecules can also be described as polar.

People traveled on the Oregon Trail in wagons in order to settle new parts of the United States of America during the 19th century. The Oregon Trail started in Missouri near the area where Kansas City, Missouri is today and ended in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. The Trail was about 2,170 miles (3,500 km) long, and could take up to six months to travel.
People went to Oregon for many reasons. Some people wanted land. Some thought Oregon would be a better place to live. Most of them went because they wanted a new life.
The Oregon Trail was first traveled around 1841. Once a railroad was built across the United States in 1869, people could take trains to the western United States, so fewer people began to travel west in wagons. By that time, about 400,000 people had crossed the Oregon Trail in wagons. However, some people kept traveling the Trail until the 1880s.
Preparing to travel.
Nobody traveled the Oregon Trail alone. Instead, travelers formed groups so they could help and protect each other. Often, relatives or people from the same town would travel together. They would hire a guide that knew the Trail and would elect leaders. The groups that did best on the Trail wrote constitutions or rules that they could use to settle disagreements or problems on the Trail.
Supplies.
Animals.
People who traveled the Oregon Trail could use three types of animals to pull their wagons: oxen, mules, or horses. Most people used oxen. They were less expensive than horses and mules, and also less stubborn than mules.pp. 79–80
They could eat grass along the Trail, unlike horses, who needed grains when they were working. Oxen were easy to train, and they usually traveled at a steady pace of 2 miles per hour, even in mud and snow.pp. 79–80
Food.
It was very important for travelers to carry enough food and water for the trip. However, food for the trip was expensive. To feed four people for six months, food would cost about $150 - over $4,500 in today's dollars.p. 274
Travelers often brought along a lot of dried meat and "bread stuff" (like flour, crackers, and hardtack). Boiling water was difficult on the Trail, so cooking was not always possible. Some travelers also brought other foods, like rice, peas, dried beans, or dried fruit.
Along the Trail, travelers could fish and hunt for food. Bison, antelope, and deer were the best animals to hunt for food. Travelers also ate berries that grew along the Trail, partly to help prevent scurvy.
Wagons.
Most travelers used covered wagons to travel the Trail. There were a few different styles of covered wagons. One common style, called the "Independence-style" wagon, was usually about 11 feet long, four feet wide, and two feet deep. Pieces of wood held up a cover, made of something like dried ox skin, that rose about five feet above the bottom of the wagon.
Dangers.
There were many dangers along the Oregon Trail, including disease, bad weather, drowning during river crossings, attacks by Native Americans, and many others.
It is difficult to know how many people died along the Oregon Trail. Many travelers would bury their dead in unmarked graves and would disguise the graves. For example, they would bury people right in the middle of a trail and then have their oxen run over the graves. They did this so that animals and robbers would not dig up the graves. Because of this, historians can only estimate the total number of people who died along the Oregon Trail.
Diseases.
Disease was the most common cause of death on the Trail. While travelers usually brought some medicines with them, they usually were not very helpful.
Cholera.
Cholera was the most common illness and cause of death on the Trail. From 1849-1855, there was a cholera epidemic along the trail. Up to 3% of all travelers during this time may have died from cholera. One of the causes of the epidemic was that there was no sanitation along the Trail.
For example, travelers liked to camp along the Platte River in Colorado, so they could easily get fresh water. However, as thousands of travelers used the same campsites over and over again, sewage from travelers with cholera got into the Platte River. After this, any traveler that drank water from the Platte River, or made food with that water, could get cholera. Often, cholera's symptoms would be so bad that travelers would die within 12 hours of getting sick.
Other diseases.
Other diseases common on the Trail included:
The travelers used turpentine (a poison), vinegar, and whiskey to treat headaches, muscle pain, and coughs.
Historians do not agree on how many people died from disease along the Trail. One historian, John Unruh, estimates that 6,000 to 12,500 travelers died from disease on the Trail, and another 300-500 died specifically from scurvy. However, the United States National Park Service says that as many as 30,000 people may have died from disease along the Trail.
Other dangers.
There were many other dangers along the Trail. John Unruh estimates the number of people who died from these other dangers:
Unruh estimates that 4 percent of the Oregon Trail travelers died: 16,000 out of 400,000 total travelers. However, the National Park Service says:
"The Oregon Trail is this nation’s longest graveyard. Nearly one in ten [travelers] who set off on the trail did not survive."
Life on the Trail.
A usual day on the Trail started very early, just before dawn. Nobody actually rode in the wagons unless they were sick or very young. The ride was too bumpy, too dusty, and added too much work for the oxen. Instead, people walked beside their wagons. Usually, groups traveled almost all day, except for an hour around noon for lunch. Then they kept moving until just before sunset, when they would stop to set up a campsite. Most groups traveled about 15 miles per day, though on the best days they could move 20 miles a day. Since oxen moved at about 2 miles per hour, this meant a day's travel could last up to ten hours.
About 40,000 of the travelers were children. Unless they were babies, they walked alongside the wagons and worked just like adults. Their jobs included herding animals, driving wagons, washing dishes, helping with meals, watching younger children, and collecting firewood and "buffalo chips" (dry buffalo manure, which could be used to start fires if there was no firewood).
At night, the group would move the wagons into a circle ("circle the wagons") and put their animals inside the circle. This kept them from wandering away, or being killed or stolen. If the weather was dry, people slept outside. If it was wet, people slept under their wagons.
Many travelers were very afraid of attacks from Native Americans. However, most Native Americans left the travelers alone, or even helped them by trading with them and helping them cross rivers in canoes. When Native Americans did attack travelers, the stories were told over and over again, which may have made attacks seem more common than they actually were.
Travelers who did reach Oregon looked back on the Trail with different feelings. One man named Loren Hastings said in 1847: 
"I look back upon the long, dangerous and precarious emigrant road with a degree of romance and pleasure; but to others it is the graveyard of their friends."
Computer game.
In the 1970s, three student teachers in Minnesota made an educational computer game based on the Oregon Trail. The goal of the game was to successfully travel the trail from Independence, Missouri to Oregon City, Oregon. Dangers of the trail included river crossings, illnesses, sick oxen, and hunger. Over the next two decades, new versions of the game were made that added more options and included better graphics. The second version included zombies and oxen. The goal was to survive as long as you can before you die.

The Brooklyn Bridge is one of the oldest suspension bridges in the United States. It is long. The bridge goes over the East River. It connects the New York City boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn. It is one of the leading landmarks of New York City.
The bridge was built from 1869 to 1883. It was the first fixed crossing of the East River. It was designed by John Roebling. The construction was directed by his son Washington Roebling and Washington's wife, Emily. When it was finished, it was the tallest structure in North America.
The bridge is an official landmark. It has been a National Historic Landmark since 1964. It became a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1972.

A red card in sport is a punishment to a player of a team. It is usually given to a player who has broken the rules of the game.
In football (soccer).
In football rules, a red card means that the player is sent off the field, and is not allowed to play in the rest of the match. A player with a red card is automatically banned from his team's next game. In some cases, the player may be banned for multiple games.

KWord is a free word processor, a part of the KOffice project and of the K Desktop Environment.
The text-layout scheme in KWord is based on frames, making it look like Adobe FrameMaker. These can be placed anywhere on the page, and can include text, graphics and embedded objects. Each new page is a new frame, but the text is able to flow through KWord’s ability to link frames together. The use of frames means that complex graphical layouts can be achieved easily in KWord.
History.
KWord was created as part of the KOffice project in 1998 using some ideas from FrameMaker such as the frames approach. The first author said that the application and its code were not the best since it was his first object-oriented application.
In 2000 the KWord application was created in a way that made it very hard to fix problems and nobody was working on the problems anymore. There had not been any official release of the application in all this time. In the same year a new maintainer started working on the application and over the duration of 2000 and the beginning of 2001 they worked to fix any problems in the code of the application.

The Nation of Islam is an African-American ethno-nationalist and religious group. It was founded in Detroit, Michigan, in 1930 by Master Farad Muhammad and re-founded in 1977 under the leadership of Louis Farrakhan. The original group founded in the 1930s changed its name to American Society of Muslims, which rejected many of its original beliefs, including black separatism. The main goal of the Nation of Islam is to bring back the spiritual, mental, social and economic condition of blacks in the United States. Since 1981, the group has been led by Louis Farrakhan. Malcolm X also was a member.
Basis.
The current headquarters for the Nation of Islam is in Chicago, Illinois. The Nation of Islam is currently lead by the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan through the teachings of the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad. Elijah Muhammad met Master Farad Muhammad and was directly given lost knowledge to rebuild the children of slavery and bring them back to their original selves.
Beliefs and practices.
Religious beliefs and practices.
The Nation of Islam combines a number of religious doctrines and beliefs, primarily Islam and Dianetics. In their literature, they profess their belief in the oneness of Allah ("tawhid)" and the Qur'an. They celebrate Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Unlike orthodox Islam, they celebrate Ramadan in the winter. Their places of worship are called mosques. They also pray five times a day, although unlike in orthodox Islam, they pray in English, not Arabic. 
In addition to these Islamic beliefs and practices, the theology Nation of Islam also promotes and includes non-traditional religious beliefs. Although their contemporary website highlights their belief in the oneness of God, other sources produced by the Nation of Islam highlight their beliefs in many Gods as well. For example, Master Farad, the founder of the Nation of Islam is also considered "God in person". This is a belief that would be strongly refuted in traditional Islamic teaching. They also believe that Allah is a black man and that each cycle of history is ruled by a different God, who dies once his cycle is over. 
The flag.
The flag of the Nation of Islam has the symbols of the sun, moon, and the stars. It represents the universe. It is also a banner of universal peace and harmony.

WrestleMania III was the third yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view event made by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The event was held on March 29, 1987 at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan.
The event is particularly notable for the record attendance of 93,173, the largest recorded attendance for a live indoor sporting event in North America. Though differing numbers have been argued, the event is considered to be the pinnacle of the 1980s wrestling boom. Almost one million fans watched the event at 160 closed circuit locations in North America. The number of people watching via pay-per-view was estimated at several million, and pay-per-view revenues were estimated at $10 million.

Arthur Guseni Oliver Mutambara (born 25 May 1966) is a Zimbabwean politician. He became the President of a faction of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in February 2006. He has worked as the Managing Director and CEO of Africa Technology and Business Institute since September 2003.

Lucille Frances Ryan (born 29 March 1968) is a New Zealand actress. When she was twenty years old, she got her first acting job in the TV program "Funny Business". In 1995, she starred in her first television series, "", becoming in an international star in this role.
Lawless is also known for her role as "D'anna Biers" in the TV series "Battlestar Galactica" between 2005 and 2008. During a break in 1997 between filming seasons on Xena, Lawless made her onstage debut singing songs on Broadway as Rizzo in the remake of the musical play Grease.
Since her role as Xena, Lawless has pursued a new career in singing after being a contestant on "Celebrity Duets". She sang at the Roxy in Hollywood in 2007, and has since performed regularly in concerts and released several CDs. She has a contralto singing range.
Early life.
She was born in Auckland on 29 March 1968. Lawless' mother, Julie, was teacher, and her father, Frank, was mayor. She has 6 brothers. She had bulimia and Depression.
Lawless began acting in secondary school, attending Marist College, New Zealand, in Mount Albert. She studied foreign languages at Auckland University for a year before dropping out and leaving for Europe with her boyfriend, Garth Lawless, to travel to Germany and Switzerland. The couple then moved to Australia, where she worked briefly as a gold miner.
Career.
Lawless wanted to act since she was five. She took her first acting class at the school. Lawless starred various national television commercials when she was a child. One of these was for McDonald's. She played an Amazon in the TV movie "Hercules and the Amazon Women", in 1994, and Lisya in his Spin-off, the TV series "" em 1995. In the same year, she plays Xena in three episodes, returning later.
In September, Xena won her own series, "", Lawless was the star in the program during 6 years. Lawless first appeared on Broadway in September 1997 in the "Grease play remake", as the "bad girl" Rizzo character. She applied to play the squeaky-clean naive blond girl Sandra Dee, but she claimed the producers after Xena had typed her to playing only "bad girls." She said the Sandy character was very similar to her sheltered childhood, growing up in New Zealand with many protective older brothers.
Lawless has since appeared onstage in the "Vagina Monologues" and as a television guest star in episodes of The Simpsons, The X-Files, Just Shoot Me!, Veronica Mars, Burn Notice, and Curb Your Enthusiasm. She was also featured in the short-lived television series Tarzan. Lawless has made cameo appearances in the movies EuroTrip, Spider-Man and Boogeyman. She returned to television in the TV movie Locusts! and its sequel Vampire Bats.
From 2005 to 2008, Lawless has had a recurring role in the television series Battlestar Galactica. She portrays D'Anna Biers, a reporter with the "Fleet News Service" who works on a critical documentary about the crew of the Galactica and is later revealed to be a Cylon.
Public image.
In 1997, Lawless was named one of the "50 Most Beautiful People in the World" by "People" magazine. Days earlier on 6 May 1997, Lawless inadvertently exposed a breast as she concluded a performance of the US national anthem at an NHL hockey game in Anaheim, California between the Mighty Ducks and Detroit Red Wings. Lawless was quoted in Newsweek as saying:
Lawless has enjoyed a particular cult status in the lesbian community. Some of the lesbian fan base sees Lawless as a lesbian icon. A group called The Marching Xenas has participated in many gay and lesbian pride parades.
Some fans felt that the sexual nature of Xena and the character Gabrielle's relationship was cemented by an interview given by Lucy Lawless to "Lesbian News" magazine in 2003. Lawless stated that after the series finale, where Gabrielle revives Xena with a mouth-to-mouth water transfer filmed to look like a full kiss, she had come to believe that Xena and Gabrielle's relationship was "definitely gay... there was always a 'well, she might be or she might not be' but when there was that drip of water passing between their lips in the very final scene, that cemented it for me".
Costume donation.
In 2006, Lucy Lawless donated her personal Xena costume to the Museum of American History. In an interview the same year with "Smithsonian" magazine, she was asked the question "Was the Warrior Princess outfit comfortable?" and she responded:
Personal life.
At the age of nineteen, Lawless became pregnant with Garth's child. In 1988, they married in Kalgoorlie, Australia. They returned to New Zealand and had a daughter, Daisy Lawless (born 15 July 1988), who also attended Marist College, New Zealand. The couple divorced in 1995. Lawless married "Xena" executive producer Robert Tapert on 28 March 1998. Lawless and Tapert have two sons: Julius Robert Bay Tapert (born 16 October 1999) and Judah Miro Tapert (born 7 May 2002), both born in Auckland.
Honours.
In the 2004 Queen's Birthday Honours, Lawless was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to entertainment and the community.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator. It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). It is a giant circular tunnel built underground. The tunnel is 17 miles (27 kilometers) long, and between 50 and 175 meters below the ground. It lies beneath the border of Switzerland and France. 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 different countries worked together in the making of this project, and it cost 10.4 billion Swiss francs ($10 billion) to build. It is now the largest and most complicated experimental research facility in the world.
As its name states, the research at the LHC involves the collision of hadrons. A hadron is a particle which consists of a number of quarks held together by the subatomic strong force. Protons and neutrons are examples of a hadron. The LHC primarily uses the collision of protons in its experiments. Protons are parts of atoms with a positive charge. The LHC accelerates these protons through the tunnel until they reach nearly the speed of light. Different protons are directed through the tunnel in opposite directions. When they collide, they create conditions similar to the early universe.
The LHC attempts to study elementary particles and the ways they interact. Researchers have used it to learn about quantum physics, and they hope to learn much more about the structure of space and time. The observations researchers are able to make can help us learn what the universe might have been like within milliseconds after the big bang.
How it works.
The LHC ionizes Hydrogen atoms to get their protons. A Hydrogen atom consists of only one proton and one electron. When they ionize the atoms, they are removing the one electron to give it a net positive charge. The Hydrogen protons are then directed through the circle by electromagnets. In order for the magnets to be strong enough, it must be very cold. The inside of the tunnel is cooled by liquid helium. They keep the temperature at just above absolute zero. The protons hit one another at close to the speed of light and this creates lots of particles, many of which only live a short time before decaying to lighter particles. At the four collision sites, there are large detectors called ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb.
When the particles hit each other, their energy is converted into many different particles, and sensitive detectors keep track of the pieces that are created. By looking carefully at the detector data, scientists can study what the particles are made of and how the particles interact. This is the only way to detect some particles because very high energy is needed to create them. The LHC's particle collisions have the energy needed.
The LHC has three main parts to it. There is the particle accelerator, the four detectors, and the Grid. The accelerator creates the collision, but the results cannot be directly observed. The detectors turn it into usable data and send it to the Grid. The Grid is a computer network that the researchers use to interpret the data. There are 170 locations in 36 different countries which are filled with regular desktop computers. All of these computers are connected, and together they act as a supercomputer. The LHC's Grid is considered the most powerful supercomputer ever built. The computers share processing power and data storage space.
The Grid is very powerful, but it is only able to take in about one percent of the data it receives from the detectors. Its limitations have motivated attempts at creating quantum computers, which could use what the LHC has taught us about quantum mechanics in order to make faster computers.
Scientists used the LHC to find the Higgs boson, a particle predicted to exist by the Standard Model.
Some people thought the LHC could create a black hole, which would be very dangerous. There are two reasons not to be worried. The first is that the LHC didn't do anything that the cosmic rays that hit the Earth every day don't do, and these rays do not create black holes. The second reason is that even if the LHC did make black holes, they would be very tiny. The smaller a black hole is, the shorter its life. Very tiny black holes would evaporate before they could hurt people.
The LHC was first used on September 10, 2008, but it did not work because a cooling system broke. The magnets that help to move the charged particles must be cold. The failure caused part of the facility to collapse. The lab shut down for the winter and the collider was not used again until November 2009. While it was being repaired, scientists used the Tevatron to look for the Higgs Boson. When the LHC was restarted in November 2009, it set a new speed record by accelerating protons to 1.18 TeV (teraelectronvolt, or trillion electronvolt). On March 30 2010, the LHC created a collision at 3.5 TeV.

Predicive failure analysis is a technology developed by IBM to monitor the likelihood of a hard disk failure. Today, it is part of S.M.A.R.T.

Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) is a technology designed to move data to and from computer storage devices such as hard drives and tape drives. It is a point-to-point serial protocol that replaces the parallel SCSI. SCSI first appeared in the mid 1980s in corporate data centers. SAS uses the standard SCSI command set. At present it is slightly slower than the final parallel SCSI implementation, but in 2009 it will double its present speed to 6 Gbit/s. This will permit much higher speed data transfers. The protocol is "downwards"-compatible with second generation SATA drives. These drives may be connected to SAS backplanes (controllers), but SAS drives can not be connected to SATA backplanes. 
The SAS protocol is developed and maintained by the T10 technical committee of the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) and promoted by the SCSI Trade Association (SCSITA).
Connectors.
The SAS connector is much smaller than traditional parallel SCSI connectors allowing for the small drives. SAS supports point data transfer speeds up to 3 Gbit/s, but is expected to reach 12 Gbit/s by the year 2012. 
The physical SAS connector is available in several different variants:

"The Judas Kiss" is the fourth single off the album by rock band Metallica off their ninth studio album "Death Magnetic". 

Tagged Command Queueing (TCQ) is a technology that allows to send multiple read and write requests to a hard drive simultaneously. ATA TCQ is not identical in function to the more efficient Native Command Queuing (NCQ) used by SATA drives. SCSI TCQ does not suffer from the same limitations as ATA TCQ.
Before TCQ, an operating system was only able to send one request at a time. In order to boost performance, it had to decide the order of the requests based on its own, possibly incorrect, idea of what the hard drive was doing. With TCQ, the drive can make its own decisions about how to order the requests (and in turn relieve the operating system from having to do so). The result is that TCQ can improve the overall performance of a hard drive if it is implemented correctly.
Overview.
For efficiency the sectors should be serviced in order of proximity to the current head position, rather than in the order received. The queue is constantly receiving new requests and fulfilling and removing existing requests, and re-ordering the queue according to the current pending read/write requests and the changing position of the head. The exact reordering algorithm may depend upon the controller and the drive itself, but the host computer simply makes requests as needed, leaving the controller to handle the details.
This queuing mechanism is sometimes referred to as "elevator seeking", as the image of a modern elevator in a building servicing multiple calls and processing them to minimise travel illustrates the idea well.
If the buttons for floors 5, 2, and 4 are pressed in that order with the elevator starting on floor 1, an old elevator would go to the floors in the order requested. A modern elevator processes the requests to stop at floors in the logical order 2, 4, and 5, without unnecessary travel. Non-queueing disk drives service the requests in the order received, like an old elevator; queueing drives service requests in the most efficient order. This may improve performance slightly in a system used by a single user, but really comes into its own in a system with many users, making requests all over the disk surface.

Serial Storage Architecture is a technology used to attach hard disks to Servers. It was developed by IBM in the 1990s. IBM produced a number of drives with this standard, but today, it has been largely replaced by the Fibre Channel architecture.

The NBA All-Star Game is an NBA game in which the best players in the Eastern Conference play with the best players in the Western Conference. The first game started on March 2, 1951 at the Boston Garden. The game is played differently than a normal basketball game, but stick to normal NBA rules.

A Biblical manuscript is any handwritten copy of a portion of the text of the Bible. They vary in size from tiny scrolls containing individual verses of the Jewish scriptures to huge polyglot codices containing both the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and the New Testament, as well as other works.
Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh) manuscripts.
The Aleppo Codex ("c." 920 AD) and Leningrad Codex ("c." 1008 AD) were the oldest Hebrew language manuscripts of the Tanakh. The 1947 find at Qumran of the Dead Sea scrolls pushed the manuscript history of the Tanakh back a millennium from the two earliest complete codices. Before this discovery, the earliest extant manuscripts of the Old Testament were in Greek in manuscripts such as Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus. Out of the roughly 800 manuscripts found at Qumran, 220 are from the Tanakh. Every book of the Tanakh is represented except for the Book of Esther; however, most are fragmentary. Notably, there are two scrolls of the Book of Isaiah, one complete (1QIsa), and one around 75% complete (1QIsb). These manuscripts generally date between 150 BC to 70 AD.
Ancient Jewish scribes developed many practices to protect copies of their scriptures from error.
New Testament manuscripts.
Parts of the New Testament have been preserved in more manuscripts than any other ancient work. There are over 5,800 complete or fragmented Greek manuscripts, 10,000 Latin manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages, such as Syriac, Slavic, Gothic, Ethiopic, Coptic and Armenian. 
The dates of these manuscripts range from about 125 AD (the Ryland manuscript, P52; containing fragments of the oldest copy of John) to the introduction of printing in Germany in the 15th century. Most of these manuscripts date after the 10th century. Although there are more manuscripts that preserve the New Testament than there are for any other ancient writing, the text preserved in these later, numerous manuscripts may not be the same as the text as it existed in antiquity. 
Textual scholar Bart Ehrman wrote: 
In reference to the textual evidence for the New Testament, Bruce M. Metzger wrote, 
Every year, several New Testament manuscripts handwritten in the original Greek format are discovered. 

A jug band is a band that has a jug player and a variety of home-made instruments. These home-made instruments could be ordinary objects adapted to or created to make sound, like the washtub bass, washboard, spoons, stovepipe, and comb and tissue paper (kazoo). The Memphis Jug Band was a famous band from the 1920s to the 1950s.

Quṭb al-Dīn Aibak also spelled Quṭb ud-Dīn Aibak or Qutub ud-Din Aybak, (1150–1210), was the founder of the Mamluk Dynasty in Delhi and the first sultan of the Delhi Sultanate. He was born at Turk in the Aybak tribe and was the sultan for only four years, 1206-1210.
Early life.
Qutub-ud-din Aibak was born to a Turk family in Central Asia. He was sold as a slave in his childhood. But this went well because he was brought up by the chief Qazi of Nishapur, a town in northeastern Iran. He was treated like one of the sons of this Qazi and was given a good education, including training in archery and horsemanship. However when the master died, his jealous sons sold Qutub-ud-din Aibak to a slave master.
Advancement and military conquests.
Qutub-ud-din Aibak was finally purchased by the ruler of Ghor in central Afghanistan, Sultan Muhammad Ghori. Qutub-ud-din Aibak gradually rose to the rank of a Commander and became a trusted slave of Sultan Ghori. The conquests of northern India were executed mainly by Qutub-ud-din Aibak, which helped Ghori to consolidate his position there. Gradually, as Sultan Ghori concentrated on Central Asia after 1192, he was given the independent charge of the conquests in India. In India, Qutub-ud-din Aibak is infamous for massive destruction and plunder of several Hindu temples, whose wealth he looted away. His lieutenant, Bhakthiar Khilji, following in his master's footsteps ravaged the famous university of Nalanda, killing all the monks and scholars there, as well as burning the huge library down. It is said that the fires raged for 3 months, such was the voluminous material being burnt.
Sultan.
Muhammad Ghori established himself as strong ruler with his empire extending over Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northern India. Qutb-ud-din Aibak crowned himself the Sultan of Delhi in 1206, when Muhammad Ghori was killed on the battlefield. After his death, when Aibak came to the throne, he ruled over those places where he was appointed as the local receiver-general of Sultan Ghori. Despite the rebellions by nobles like Taj-ud-din Ildiz and Nasir-ud-din Qubachah, he strengthened the administrative system, which had been established by ghori
Though Qutb-ud-din Aibak started the construction of the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque which was among the earliest Muslim monuments in Delhi, he could not complete them. These architectures were later completed by his successor Shamsuddin iltumishs. He started building the "Adhai Din Ka Jhopra" (meaning "Shed of 2 and half days"), a mosque in the Ajmer city of Rajasthan, India. It was commissioned by Qutb-ud-Din-Aibak, on orders of Muhammad Ghori, in 1192 CE. It was completed in 1199 CE, and further beautified by Iltutmish of Delhi in 1213 CE.
He constructed many other architecture.
Death and succession.
In 1210, Qutb-ud-din Aibak died in an unexpected manner, while playing polo.
He was buried in Lahore near the Anarkali Bazaar. He was succeeded by Shamsuddin Iltutmish, another slave who rose to the level of a Sultan, thus extending the Slave/Mamluk Dynasty. He wasn't interested in expanding his territory instead wanted to settle problems in his present empire.

Francis Michael "Whitey" Wistert (born February 20, 1912 in Chicago, Illinois, died April 23, 1985 in Painesville, Ohio) was an American football and baseball player. He played college football for the University of Michigan Wolverines. He was added into the College Football Hall of Fame after he was elected to it in 1967. He and his two brothers are three of the seven players who have had their uniform numbers retired by Michigan Wolverines football. While at college, Wistert helped Michigan win the Big Ten Conference football championship in 1931, 1932, and 1933. He was also Big Ten Most Valuable Player in college baseball. He later played for the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball.
College athletics.
Wistert graduated from Chicago's Schurz High School in 1929. He attended the University of Michigan where he was an athlete in both football and baseball in 1931, 1932, and 1933.
The Wistert brothers of Michigan.
Wistert played for the Michigan Wolverines before his two brothers, Al Wistert and Alvin Wistert, did. All three Wistert brothers wore the number 11 for the Wolverines football team, and all three were members of the College Football All-America team, which is the best players through all of the United States. When interviewed by the "Detroit News" in 2004, brother Alvin Wistert said, "And if I'm not mistaken I think this is unprecedented in the of college football: that three brothers all would go to the same school, all played football. All played tackle, all wore the same number 11, all made All-American. Two of us played on four national championship teams. They all made it into the College Football Hall of Fame."
The Wistert brothers grew up on the northwest side of Chicago and were the sons of a Lithuanian family. Their father was a Spanish-American War veteran, who later died while working for the Chicago Police Department. Brother Alvin Wistert said that their father, "was born Casmir Vistertus and he Anglicized it when he came to America to Wistert."
The story of the Wistert brothers at Michigan began when Whitey's Carl Schurz High School school-mate John Kowalik was invited to visit the University of Michigan. At the time, Whitey Wistert "was working in a factory building "Majestic radios"." Kowalik took Whitey with him on his visit Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Alvin Wistert later said, "that's how it started: the Wisterts of Michigan."
Football.
As a football player, Wistert played for National Championship teams that never lost a game in 1932 and 1933 and was a chosen All-American in 1933. The 1934 University of Michigan yearbook, the "Michiganensian", had this to say by Grantland Rice: "Wistert was unanimously selected as the best tackle in the Middle-West this year. He was an important part of Michigan's defensive line play. He was a very good tackler and it was nearly impossible to fool him on trick plays. He was keen, quick, and accurate in finding out how a play would happen." Wistert and Chuck Bernard were the leaders of the 1933 offensive line when the team went 7-0-1 with a tie to the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers.
One of Wistert's teammates on the 1932 and 1933 Michigan football teams was Gerald Ford who later became the U.S. President. In an interview in the February 1974 copy of "Michigan Alumnus", Wistert said about Ford: "He was a real good competitor—a real bulldog type. Even during a losing year, he was voted team Most Valuable Player by his teammates, because they believed he was someone who could stay and fight even when they lose." In 1936, he was a member Michigan football coaching staff of Coach Harry Kipke.
Baseball.
Wistert earned varsity letters in baseball three years. He was chosen as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten Conference in 1934. The 1934 "Michiganensian" yearbook wrote that the final game of the baseball season was a 4–0 shutout by Wistert against the University of Chicago Maroon. It wrote, "Wistert, for the Wolves, allowed only five well- hits during the game. Although Whitey Wistert walked four men, he more than off-set this by striking out nine of the Maroons to face him." Wistert also allowed, as the pitcher, Ohio State four hits in a game.
Professional baseball.
Wistert, still being a minor league baseball player, played for a short while in Major League Baseball, playing in three games for the Cincinnati Reds between September 11, 1934 and September 25, 1934. In two times he pitched, Wistert let only one run in eight innings, for a career earned run average of 1.13. Though, in the three times he batted, he went did not hit the ball, so he struck out twice. Although he only played for a short while in Major League Baseball, Wistert played five years of professional baseball. Fellow 1933 Michigan Wolverines football All-American, Ted Petoskey also debuted for the Reds in September 1934.
Honors.
Wistert became part of the College Football Hall of Fame in 1967, one year before his brother Albert did so. In 1981, he was named to the University of Michigan Hall of Honor in the fourth class of Hall of Fame joiners with his brothers. Only five other Michigan football players earned this honor before him.
Non-athletic.
Wistert became a New York lawyer after he retired from sports. He went on to become a vice president of an industrial relations in Toledo, Ohio. He was United States Navy lieutenant in World War II.

Sir Hersch Lauterpacht (16 August 1897 in Zółkiew, Austria-Hungary (nowadays Schowkwa in Ukraine) – 8 May 1960 in London) was an Austrian-born British jurist of Jewish descent. He was a legal scholar, specialized in international law and a philosopher of law, and also a judge and a lawyer.
Life.
Lauterpacht was born in Austrian Galicia, which became Polish after World War I. He studied in Lemberg and in Vienna. During this time he was the first president of the World Federation of Jewish Students. He moved to the United Kingdom in 1923, where he studied at the London School of Economics. He became a British citizen in 1931. 
He lectured at several British universities like the London School of Economics, the University of London, and the University of Cambridge.
Lauterpacht was a member of the United Nations' International Law Commission from 1952 to 1954, and a Judge of the International Court of Justice from 1955 to 1960. The Lauterpacht Centre for International Law at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom is named after him. His son Elihu Lauterpacht started the center and was its first director.

A Lieutenant is an officers rank in the military, police and fire departments. It is an entry level supervisory position. The word comes from the French language. Lieu means "place" and tenant means "holding". A lieutenant is someone who takes the place of a superior when that person is not available. It can also mean a deputy position to assist someone else to carry out their job. 
Military.
In many military organizations, a lieutenant is an entry level commissioned officer's rank. Generally, but not always, it is divided into two levels. 
Second Lieutenant.
A second lieutanant (2LT) (2ndLt) (2d Lt) (O1) is the lower rank of lieutanant. A second lieutenant is addressed as "lieutenant" the same as a first lieutenant. In the United States Army, for example, a second lieutenant leads a platoon made up of two or more squads or about 16 to 44 soldiers. In this capacity he or she functions as a platoon leader or commander. The length of time an officer can hold the rank of second lieutenant is different in different services. For example, in the British Army it may be held for up to 2 years.
First Lieutenant.
A first lieutenant (1LT) (1stLt) (1st Lt) (O2) is the senior rank of lieutenant. A first lieutenant is also addressed as "lieutenant". In the army, a first lieutenant often functions as the executive officer of a Company (military unit). A company may have from 110 to 140 personnel. In the British Army, an officer may hold this rank for up to three years.
There is great variation in the insignia used worldwide. In most English-speaking and Arabic-speaking countries, as well as a number of European and South American nations, full lieutenants (and equivalents) usually wear two stars (pips) and second lieutenants (and equivalents) one. An example of an exception is the United States, whose armed forces distinguish their lieutenant ranks with one silver bar for first lieutenant and one gold (brass) bar for second lieutenant.
In many Navies including the United States Navy, a lieutenant is the equivalent rank to an army captain and a lieutenant (junior grade) is the same as an army first lieutenant. The equivalent to a second lieutenant is the naval rank of ensign.

Murrurundi is a small country town in the Upper Hunter Valley of New South Wales. Murrurundi is by road from Newcastle and km from Sydney. In 2006 there were 2162 people (ABS 2006) living in Murrurundi. The town is circled by mountains of the Liverpool Range. It is on the Pages River, which flows into the Hunter River. The name "Murrurundi" is from an Aboriginal word meaning "Five fingers". This is the name given to a group of rocks at the north end of the town.
History.
The first people to live in the Murrurundi area were the Australian aboriginal people, the Wanaruah and the Kamilaroi. European settlement of the area began in the 1820s. Benjamin Hall, the father of bushranger Ben Hall started a cattle farm in the area in 1839. The town was started by the New South Wales government in 1840. In the same year, a local land owner - Thomas Haydon - started his own town called Haydonton. Benjamin Hall opened a butcher's shop in Haydonton in 1842. Ben Hall lived here until the age of 13. In 1913, the two towns were joined together to make the modern-day town of Murrurundi.
Mining.
Kerosene shale was first mined at Mount Temi, north of Murrurundi in 1886. The mine was reopened in 1910. The shale was moved from the mine on a rope system known as an aerial ropeway. It was then loaded onto trains at a railway built at Temple Court, just west of Murrurundi. The mine closed in the First World War.
Sport.
Every year there is a rodeo and the King of the Ranges stockman (cowboy) contest. Other sports played in the town include rugby, touch football, swimming, and cricket.

The Three Mile Island accident occurred on March 28th, 1979 at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant in Pennsylvania. It was "the single most important event in the fifty-year history of nuclear power regulation in the United States". Many people have seen the event as a turning point for the nuclear power industry in the United States. 
The Three Mile Island power station is near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The accident resulted in a partial core meltdown in Unit 2 of the nuclear power plant. Unit 2's pressurized water reactor was of 900 MWe capacity. 
The chain of events that led to the crisis at the TMI plant included several minor equipment failures that operator errors drastically compounded, resulting in a major accident. The Three Mile Island accident is largely seen as a failure of crisis management. According to one reviewer of the book:
Reactor operators were not trained to deal with accident conditions, and the NRC had not established effective communication with utilities. Moreover, once the accident occurred, the lines of authority proved to be ill defined. The public received conflicting reports that caused needless panic and evacuations. It was these systemic weaknesses in the regulatory system that allowed gifted people to make the mistakes they did.
Large portions of the TMI-2 reactor core melted, though the fact that a partial meltdown had occurred did not become clear until 1985. The greatest source of concern during the TMI crisis was a hydrogen bubble that formed in the top of the pressure vessel which held the core:
Although opinions differed, some reactor experts feared that over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment inevitable, but it would increase the risk of a disastrous release of radiation.
In the end, the Three Mile Island accident, though it "caused a grave crisis, did not produce a public health disaster". In the face of a core meltdown, the pressure vessel held and there was no breach of the plant's containment structure. Only "tiny amounts of the most dangerous forms of volatile radiation escaped to the atmosphere". The TMI-2 cleanup took 11 years and cost about US$1 billion.
J. Samuel Walker suggests that the TMI accident incited widespread criticism of nuclear power technology, the nuclear industry, and the NRC. Critics faulted the industry and the NRC for their poor performance both before and after the accident. The international attention garnered by the crisis redoubled the determination of, and enhanced the credibility of, the anti-nuclear movement. Arguably, the United States nuclear industry has never recovered.
Walker reports that studies looking for long-term radiation effects resulting from the accident have reached conflicting conclusions, but it seems that any increase in cancers is slight enough to have occurred by chance.

Nuclear accidents in Japan include the following major cases: 

A nuclear accident is an accident that releases radioactivity to the environment, harmfully affects people, and causes a nuclear meltdown.
The most serious nuclear accident has been the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. Other serious nuclear accidents include Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, Three Mile Island accident, the Windscale fire, Mayak accident, and the SL-1 accident. In the period to 2007, 63 major nuclear accidents have occurred at nuclear power plants. Twenty-nine of these have occurred since the Chernobyl disaster, and 71 percent of all nuclear accidents (45 out of 63) occurred in the United States.
Fukushima, Onagawa and Tōkai.
On 11 March 2011, the Magnitude 9.0 devastating Sendai earthquake and tsunami took place in Japan. As a result, "Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant", "Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant", "Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant" and "Tōkai Nuclear Power Plant stations" consisting of eleven (11) reactors were automatically shut down following the earthquake.
At Fukushima Daiichi and Daini tsunami waves went over seawalls and destroyed diesel backup power systems. This loss of power caused severe problems including two large explosions at Fukushima Daiichi and leakage of radiation. Over 200,000 people have been evacuated. Seismic recordings at six assessed nuclear power plant facilities indicated the plants had been exposed to "peak ground accelerations" of 0.037–0.383 "g" and "peak ground velocities" of 6.18–52.62 cm/sec.
One year after the accident, the official death toll related to the Fukushima accident has been five: one caused by the earthquake, another one had a heart attack, two people drowned, and a last person died in October for unreported causes. None of the deaths have been caused by radiation.
Chernobyl disaster.
The Chernobyl disaster was a major accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant on April 26, 1986, with an explosion at the plant and later radioactive contamination of the surrounding area. It is so far the worst nuclear accident in the history of nuclear power. A plume of radioactive fallout drifted over parts of the western Soviet Union, Eastern and Western Europe, Scandinavia, the UK, Ireland and eastern North America. Large areas of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia were badly damaged, forcing the people in charge to have to evacuate and resettle more than 336,000 people. About 60% of the radioactive fallout landed in Belarus, according to official post-Soviet data.
The accident made many people worried about the safety of the Soviet nuclear power industry. As a result, plans for more nuclear plants were put on hold and the Soviet government, who were not very open with its data, had to make public more of its data. The now-independent countries of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus have had to spend a lot of money and time on decontamination and health care costs of the Chernobyl accident. Nobody knows how many people died because of this accident. This is because the Soviets covered up information, did not fully complete lists, and did not let doctors list "radiation" as the reason why some people died. Most of the expected long-term deaths, such as that from cancer, have not yet happened and it is hard to say that Chernobyl was the full reason for their deaths.
At Fukushima I and II tsunami waves overtopped seawalls and destroyed diesel backup power systems, leading to severe problems including two large explosions at Fukushima I and leakage of radiation.
Three Mile Island accident.
On March 28, 1979, the Unit 2 nuclear power plant on the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station (TMI-2) in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania near Harrisburg suffered a partial core meltdown.
The Three Mile Island accident was the worst accident in American commercial nuclear power generating history, even though it led to no deaths or injuries to plant workers or members of the nearby community.
The accident unfolded over the course of five tense days, as a number of agencies at local, state and federal level tried to diagnose the problem and decide whether or not the on-going accident required a full emergency evacuation of the population. The full details of the accident were not discovered until much later. In the end, the reactor was brought under control. Although approximately 25,000 people lived within five miles of the island at the time of the accident, no identifiable injuries due to radiation occurred, and a government report concluded that "the projected number of excess fatal cancers due to the accident... is approximately one". But the accident had serious economic and public relations consequences, and the cleanup process was slow and costly. It also furthered a major decline in the public popularity of nuclear power, exemplifying for many the worst fears about nuclear technology and, until the Chernobyl disaster seven years later, it was considered the world's worst civilian nuclear accident.
Davis-Besse.
Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station is a nuclear power plant with a single reactor located on the southwest shore of Lake Erie near Oak Harbor, Ohio. According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Davis-Besse has been the source of two of the top five most dangerous nuclear incidents in the United States since 1979.
SL-1 accident.
The SL-1, or Stationary Low-Power Reactor Number One, was a United States Army experimental nuclear power reactor which underwent a steam explosion and meltdown in January 1961, killing its three operators. The direct cause was the improper withdrawal by a maintenance team of a single reactor control rod. The event is the only reported fatal reactor accident in the United States.
Windscale fire.
On October 10, 1957, the graphite core of a British nuclear reactor at Windscale, Cumbria, caught fire, releasing substantial amounts of radioactive contamination into the surrounding area. The event, known as the Windscale fire, was considered the world's worst nuclear accident until the Three Mile Island accident in 1979.
The fire itself released an estimated 20,000 curies (700 |terabecquerels) of radioactive material into the nearby countryside. Of particular concern was the radioactive isotope iodine-131, which has a half-life of only 8 days but is taken up by the human body and stored in the thyroid. As a result, consumption of iodine-131 often leads to cancer of the thyroid.
No one was evacuated from the surrounding area, but there was concern that milk might be dangerously contaminated. Milk from about 500 km2 of nearby countryside was destroyed (diluted a thousandfold and dumped in the Irish Sea) for about a month.
Mayak accident.
Mayak is the name of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plants 150 km northwest of Chelyabinsk in Russia. Working conditions at Mayak resulted in severe health hazards and many accidents, with a serious accident occurring in 1957.
The 1957 Kyshtym disaster occurred when the failure of the cooling system for a tank storing tens of thousands of tons of dissolved nuclear waste resulted in a non-nuclear explosion having a force estimated at about 75 tons of TNT (310 gigajoules), which released some 20 MCi (740 petabecquerels) of radiation. Subsequently, at least 200 people died of radiation sickness, 10,000 people were evacuated from their homes, and 470,000 people were exposed to radiation.
Attacks on nuclear plants.
Nuclear reactors become easy targets during military conflict and, over the past three decades, have been repeatedly attacked:
Radiation accidents.
Radiation is harmful to health and there have been many accidents caused by radiation:

Plastic surgery is a surgery that is done to change the way a person's body looks or works. Some plastic surgeries can change both. Work can be done on someone's bones, cartilage, muscles, fat, and skin.
The two most common forms of plastic surgery are reconstruction (fixing body parts that have been damaged) and cosmetic (changing size shape or color of body parts to make them look better). An example of reconstructive plastic surgery is fixing a part of the body that has been burned. An example of cosmetic plastic surgery is a surgery called a "face-lift": pulling the skin of the face tight so that the client looks younger.

Aung San Suu Kyi (born 19 June 1945 in Yangon, Burma) is a human rights activist, Nobel Peace Prize winner, and State Counsellor of Myanmar.
Suu Kyi was not able to be president. Instead, she became the State Counsellor of Myanmar.
She brought some democracy to her country with nonviolence. 
She is the leader of the National League for Democracy in Burma and a famous prisoner. She has been under house arrest several times. Suu Kyi won the Rafto Prize and the Sakharov Prize in 1990, and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. In 1992, she was awarded the Jawaharlal Nehru peace prize.
She is sometimes called "Daw Aung San Suu Kyi". Daw is not part of her name, but a title for older women. This name shows respect for her. She is called Amay Suu by the people, meaning Mother Suu.
On 1 February 2021, Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested and removed from power by the military during a coup d'état. The military thought the government changed the results of the November 2020 Myanmar general election. On February 3, Suu Kyi was accused of breaking Myanmar's import laws. On February 16, Myanmar police filed a second criminal charge against her, this time for breaking the country's Natural Disaster Law. There were more charges and in December 2022 she was sentenced to 33 years in prison, later reduced to 27 years. 
Personal life.
Aung San Suu Kyi was the third child in her family. Her name "Aung San" comes from her father, who is also named Aung San; "Kyi" comes from her mother; and "Suu" comes from her grandmother.
Her father helped to make Burma independent from the United Kingdom in 1947. He was killed in the same year. She grew up with her mother, Khin Kyi, and two brothers, Aung San Lin and Aung San Oo in Yangon. One of her brothers, Aung San Lin, drowned when Suu Kyi was eight. Her other brother, Aung San Oo currently lives in San Diego, California and is an American citizen.
Suu Kyi went to Catholic schools for much of her childhood in Burma. She learned English in school.
Khin Kyi, Suu Kyi's mother, became famous as a politician. She became the Burmese ambassador to India in 1960. Aung San Suu Kyi went to college in India at the Lady Shri Ram College for Women in New Delhi. Suu Kyi continued her education at St Hugh's College, Oxford, and learned about philosophy, politics, and economics. She also went to the School of Oriental and African Studies at University of London in the 1980s.
She moved to New York and worked at the United Nations. In 1972, Aung San Suu Kyi married Michael Aris (1946-1999), a professor of Tibetan culture who lived in Bhutan. She had met Aris when they were both students at Oxford. In 1973, she gave birth to her first son, Alexander, in London; and in 1977 she had her second son, Kim.
Political career.
Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma in 1988 to take care of her sick mother. That year, the long-time leader of the socialist ruling party, General Ne Win, retired.
She admired Mohandas Gandhi's use of nonviolence. She was also inspired by Buddhism. Aung San Suu Kyi worked for democracy and helped make the National League for Democracy on September 27th 1988. Because Suu Kyi was working against the government, she was asked to leave the country, but she did not.
She was arrested in 1989 and placed in prison in 1990. This was after an election which her party, the National League for Democracy, won, but they were not allowed to be in charge of the country. Between 1990 and 2010, she was almost always in her home, which is called house arrest. Burma released her in November 2010. Suu Kyi was going to be released in 2009, but when a man entered her home she was kept on house arrest for another year because she had broken the rules of the house arrest.
After she was released from house arrest, she was elected to be State Counsellor. When she was State Counsellor, Burma had serious problems with the genocide of the Rohingya.
Political belief.
When she was asked what democratic models Myanmar could look to, she said: "We have many, many lessons to learn from various places, not just the Asian countries like South Korea, Taiwan, Mongolia and Indonesia". She also cited "the eastern European countries, which made the transition from communist autocracy to democracy in the 1980s and 1990s, and the Latin American countries, which made the transition from military governments". She added that "we wish to learn from everybody who has achieved a transition to democracy, and also (...) because we are so far behind everybody else, we can also learn which mistakes we should avoid."

The Nevada Test Site is an area set aside for the testing of nuclear weapons. It is looked after by the United States Department of Energy. It is in Nye County, Nevada, about 65 miles (105 km) northwest of Las Vegas. 
The site was begun on January 11, 1951. It covers an area of 1,350 square miles (3,500 km2) of desert and mountain lands. Nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site began with a one-kiloton (4 terajoule) bomb. This was the same explosive force as a bomb using 1,000 metric tons of TNT. This bomb was dropped on Frenchman Flat on January 27, 1951. Many of the famous photos of the nuclear age were taken at the Nevada Test Site.
When testing ended in 1992, the Energy Department said that more than 300 million curies of radiation remained, making the site one of the most radioactively contaminated places in the United States. 

Snowball is a a character in the book "Animal Farm". Like Napoleon, Snowball is a boar raised by Mr. Jones for sale. Unlike Napoleon, Snowball's plans and projects are targeted at improving the quality of Manor Farm. He is a vivacious pig, quick in speech, and a brilliant inventor.
Snowball is based on Trotsky of the October Revolution, who was exiled by Stalin and later murdered by the KGB (Soviet secret police) on Stalin's order.

Prajna is a Buddhist word meaning wisdom. It is one of three divisions of the Noble Eightfold Path. The understanding is a goal of contemplation. Buddhism traces its origins to Siddattha Gotama, who lived from about 563 to 483 BCE. He was known as the Buddha, which means "the enlightened one".

On January 25 2006, Palestinians voted for the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). Without counting the 2005 municipal elections and the January 9, 2005 presidential election, this was the first election to the PLC since 1996; since then, elections had been delayed several times due to the continuing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestinian voters in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank including East Jerusalem were allowed to participate in the election.
Final results show that Hamas won the election, with 74 seats. The ruling party, Fatah, only got 45, giving Hamas the majority of the 132 available seats and the chance to form a majority government on their own. Analysis of election results shows that the number of seats each party won agrees with their percentage of the vote for the 66 list seats. Hamas is overrepresented in the 66 district seats because it nominated more strategically than Fatah and did not have to compete with third parties and independents for the same voters' support.
The Prime Minister, Ahmed Qurei, resigned, but at the request of President Mahmoud Abbas, remained as interim Prime Minister until February 19, when Hamas leader Ismail Haniya formed the new government. The Quartet threatened to cut funds to the Palestinian Authority following the elections.

OGame is a browser-based strategy game. The game was created in 2002 by Gameforge. OGame is able to go in different languages. It also has up to 39 uni (for short) or universes.
Game play.
Each player starts with one randomly given planet, with the starting name of "Homeworld" (which can be changed). Building from that one planet, he/she later has the option to keep on developing that planet or to expand his/her colony to include up to as many planets they can afford to build, originally 9 planets. All construction, research, and missions are performed and launched from a planet or moon. While playing the player has a chance of building fleets and defenses for their planet.
Alliances.
An alliance is a group of people who have banded together and is mostly used for solidarity purposes. Alliances are created for players to protect each other from attacks, join together to raid other planets, or to promote free trade amongst members. Members of an alliance can use the ACS (Alliance Combat System), available in all universes.
Buildings.
Metal Mine is what is used to gather the resource metal.
Crystal Mine is what is used to gather the resource crystal.
Deuterium Synthesizer is what is used to gather the resource deuterium.
Solar Plant is a plant that produces energy from the sun to run mines or to do research.
Fusion Reactor is like a solar plant but instead of gathering energy from the sun it uses deterium to produce it's energy.
Robotic Factory is a building that decreases the building time of buildings.
Nanite Factory is an upgraded version of the robotics factory.
Resources.
There are four resources used in OGame: metal, crystal, deuterium,and dark matter.
Metal is mainly used for buildings, Ships, Defenses. To get this resources he/she has to upgrade or build a metal mine.
Crystal is the second resource. Crystal is mostly used in research. Crystal is one of the hardest resource to obtain. It is obtained by building or upgrading a crystal mine.
Deuterium is the third resource and can be obtained only from deuterium synthesizers. Deuterium is mainly used as fuel for a player's fleet to perform a mission, and for research.
Dark Matter is a resource that can be bought with real money. If a user doesn't want to pay this resource will become the most rarest resource in the game. Dark Matter can be found on expeditions with the players fleet after researching Expedition.
Energy is not actual energy you get from a mine but from solar planets and fusion reactors. Energy is needed to be able to run the mines to gather metal, crystal, deuterium, and to do research.
A list of how these resources are obtained:
Combat.
Unlike other games, OGame doesn't allow the player to control his ships. While playing the game a player can send units to a specific moon or planet. Once the ship(s) arrive at the planet the player can only recall the ships, he/she cannot fly them.
Research.
Researching various fields of science allows for better buildings, ships and defensive structures to be built. Research must be done for the production of Solar Satellites, which supplies power, to the fearsome Death Star, which is considered the strongest ship in the game.
The costs of research usually doubles each level, with the exception of Graviton Technology, which costs 300,000 energy and is not useful over level 1.
Research time is reduced with each upgrade of the Research Lab, or reduced dramatically with the Intergalactic Research Network researched.
Purchased effects.
All purchased effects are paid with dark matter. In order to get dark matter he/she has to buy it on OGame.
Commander.
The Commander gives the player improved functions. Features include a building order which gives the player the ability to order several buildings to be built without requiring the player to login and start a new build. The player also gets an “Empire View” that shows the player all details on every planet including ships, defenses, resources, and energy. Other bonus given by OGame Commander are message filters, shortcuts, an improved galaxy view and commands, and a gaming experience free of ads.
Officers.
On February 16, 2007, Officers were introduced to the game. It is worth noting that Gameforge had earlier promised it's users it would never introduce pay-to-play options that provided direct benefits, and the change the caused a large scale of conflict in the community.
The officer feature gives players a real advantage in the game, for a price, while those who cannot afford it go without. The 4 officers types are:
Merchants.
As of version 0.78 people can hire a merchant to trade one resource type for another. This is almost the same as trading except that there are no other players involved. The only limitation you have is the amount of free space in your storage silos and the amount of dark matter you have. You cannot trade when your silos are full, or when standing on a moon. It is wise to move away all the resources you want to keep, so that you can trade the maximum amount that your storage holds.
Rules.
OGame is monitored by Game Operators, Super Game Operators and Game Administrators each of whom have the rights to ban any player suspected of misconduct and violation of the rules. The rules can be different for each OGame universe. Players who have been banned are put into the pillory of their universe. The pillory shows the reason of banning and the administrator who made the decision. It also shows the unbanning of a player when they have clarified the fault. The planets and colonies of players that have received lifelong bans are subject to the one month account deletion due to inactivity.
Awards.
OGame won the bronze Superbrowsergame Award in 2006.

"Smells Like Teen Spirit" is a song by the American grunge band, Nirvana, from their second album "Nevermind". It is their most famous song, and one of the most famous songs ever. Many people thought the song represented the ideas of the people in Generation X (people born in the United States between 1965 and 1980.)
Writing the song.
The song was written by all three members of Nirvana. It was written to sound like a song that the Pixies (a band that Kurt Cobain enjoyed) wrote. It was originally a much faster song than the final version was. The title "Smells Like Teen Spirit" came from when Cobain's friend Kathleen Hanna spray painted "Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit" on his wall. "Teen Spirit" was the name of the deodorant that Cobain's girlfriend Tobi Vail wore. But Cobain thought it was a symbol for a "revolutionary" song or a "punk rock anthem."
People's opinions of the song.
Smells Like Teen Spirit was released in 1991. It was the first single from "Nevermind". Nirvana expected the song to not become very famous. They expected the next single, "Come as You Are", to be their big hit. However, radio stations in Seattle played Smells Like Teen Spirit, and it became a hit. Come as You Are was not as popular.
Many people who listened to the song were not able to understand what Kurt Cobain was singing. This was because he mumbled throughout the song, and the lyrics did not make sense to them. Because of this, "Weird Al" Yankovic made a parody of the song called "Smells Like Nirvana".

Billabong is an Australian brand of surf clothing which is popular with young people, in particular the Australian surf community, however, more recently of the skating, and other sporting communities.
History.
Billabong started in the Gold Coast in 1973 when surfing culture in Australia was popular. Surfers Gordon and Rena Merchant wanted to create board shorts that were strong enough to withstand the weather conditions of surfing. The name Billabong comes from the Wiradjuri word 'bilaban', which means a creek that runs during the rainy season. 
Billabong is known for their brand mottos "Life's better in boardshorts" and "A bikini kinda life".

Amandine "Aurore" Lucile Dupin, later Baroness (French:"baronne") Dudevant (1 July 1804 – 8 June 1876), best known by her pseudonym George Sand (), was a French novelist and feminist.
Early life.
Sand's father, Maurice Dupin, was the grandson of the Marshall General of France, Maurice, Comte de Saxe. He was also a distant relative of Louis XVI. Her mother, Sophie-Victoire Delaborde was a common woman. Sand was born in Paris. She spent much of her childhood with her grandmother, Marie Aurore de Saxe, Madame Dupin de Franceuil. Her grandmother lived in her estate, Nohant, in the French region of Berry. She later used the setting in many of her novels. In 1822, at age 19, she married Baron Casimir Dudevant (1795–1871), illegitimate son of Jean-François. She and Dudevant had two children: Maurice (1823–1889) and Solange (1828–1899). In early 1831 she left her husband and entered upon a four- or five-year period of "romantic rebellion." In 1835 she was legally separated from Dudevant.
How other people who lived at the time saw her.
Sand started to wear men's clothes in public. This harmed her reputation. She said that men's clothes were tougher, and also less expensive to buy than women's. The clothes she wore were comfortable, and they also allowed her to go around Paris more freely than the other women, even those of her own social standing.
Sand also smoked in public. This led to a scandal. At her time, women were not supposed to smoke, not even those of her standing. Franz Liszt had a relationship with a woman called Marie D'Agoult, who did this as well. D'Argoult smoked large cigars. These behaviors were exceptional for a woman of the early and mid-19th century, when social codes–especially in the upper classes–were very important.
Poet Charles Baudelaire was a contemporary critic of George Sand: "She is stupid, heavy and garrulous. Her ideas on morals have the same depth of judgment and delicacy of feeling as those of janitresses and kept women... The fact that there are men who could become enamoured of this slut is indeed a proof of the abasement of the men of this generation."
Relationships.
Sand had affairs with several men. These men included Jules Sandeau (1831), Prosper Mérimée, Alfred de Musset (summer 1833 – March 1834), Louis-Chrystosome Michel, Charles Didier, Pierre-François Bocage, Félicien Mallefille and Frédéric Chopin (1837–47).
Later in life, she wrote letters to Gustave Flaubert. Despite their obvious differences in temperament and aesthetic preference, they eventually became good friends.
She was engaged in an intimate friendship with actress Marie Dorval, which led to widespread but unconfirmed rumors of a lesbian affair.
In Majorca one can still visit the (then abandoned) Carthusian monastery of Valldemossa, where she spent the winter of 1838–39 with Chopin and her children. This trip to Majorca was described by her in "Un Hiver à Majorque" (A Winter in Majorca), published in 1855.
Chopin left her two years before his death, because of a family disturbance where he supported her daughter Solange's marriage choice, which had caused Sand to disown the daughter.
Writing career.
A liaison with the writer Jules Sandeau heralded her literary debut. They published a few stories in collaboration, signing them "Jules Sand." She consequently adopted, for her first independent novel, "Indiana" (1832), the pen name that made her famous – George Sand. Her first published novel, "Rose et Blanche" (1831), was written in collaboration with Sandeau.
Drawing from her childhood experiences of the countryside, she wrote the rural novels "La Mare au Diable" (1846), "François le Champi" (1847–1848), "La Petite Fadette" (1849), and "Les Beaux Messieurs Bois-Doré" (1857). "A Winter in Majorca" described the period that she and Chopin spent on that island in 1838-9. Her other novels include "Indiana" (1832), "Lélia" (1833), "Mauprat" (1837), "Le Compagnon du Tour de France" (1840), "Consuelo" (1842–1843), and "Le Meunier d'Angibault" (1845).
Further theatre pieces and autobiographical pieces include "Histoire de ma vie" (1855), "Elle et Lui" (1859) (about her affair with Musset), "Journal Intime" (posthumously published in 1926), and "Correspondence". Sand often performed her theatrical works in her small private theatre at the Nohant estate. In addition, Sand authored literary criticism and political texts. Her most widely used quote being, "There is only one happiness in life, to love and be loved."
She was known well in far reaches of the world, and her social practices, her writings and her beliefs prompted much commentary, often by other luminaries in the world of arts and letters. A few excerpts demonstrate much of what was often said about George Sand:
Death.
George Sand died at Nohant, near Châteauroux, in France's Indre "département" on 8 June 1876, at the age of 71 and was buried in the grounds of her home there. In 2004, controversial plans were suggested to move her remains to the Panthéon in Paris.
In literature.
Frequent literary references to George Sand can be found in "" (1990) by A. S. Byatt. The American poet Walt Whitman cited Sand's novel "Consuelo" as a personal favorite and the sequel to this novel "La Comtesse De Rudolstady" contains at least a couple of passages that appear to have had a very direct influence on him. Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-1861), the English poet, produced two poems "To George Sand: A Desire" and "To George Sand: A Recognition". The character, Stepan Verkhovensky, in Dostoevsky's novel "The Possessed" took to translating the works of George Sand in his periodical, before the periodical was subsequently seized by the ever-cautious Russian government of the 1840s. George Sand is referenced a number of times in the play "Voyage", the first part of Tom Stoppard's "The Coast of Utopia" trilogy. In the first episode of the "Overture" to "Swann's Way" - the first novel in Marcel Proust's "In Search of Lost Time" sequence - a young, distraught Marcel is calmed by his mother as she reads from "François le Champi", a novel which it is explained was part of a birthday package from his grandmother which also included "La Mare au Diable," "La Petite Fadette," and "Les Maîtres Sonneurs." As with many episodes involving art in "À la recherche du temps perdu", this reminiscence includes commentary on the work.

The Nuremberg Laws is the name for three (historically: two laws) that were set into practice in Germany in 1935, and that were valid until 1945. They are named after the city of Nuremberg where the legislative assembly met.
They were:
On the 14th of November 1935, the Nuremberg laws were expanded prohibiting Roma (Gypsies), Blacks or any of their offspring from engaging in marriage or sexual relations with 'Those of German or German related blood'.

A sidewalk is a path for pedestrians that runs along the side of a road. It is called a sidewalk in American English, but can also be called a pavement (mainly British English and South African English), a footpath (Australian English, Irish English, Indian English and New Zealand English) or footway (Engineering term).
Pedestrians use sidewalks to keep them safe from vehicles on the road. Sidewalks can be paved with bricks, poured concrete or tarmac. 
In suburban areas sidewalks are often separated from the roadway by a verge planted with grass and trees.
Street furniture (benches, letterboxes, transit shelters, litter bins, advertising columns, etc.) are often placed on or immediately adjacent to sidewalks.

Mazda Motor Corporation is a car manufacturer based in Hiroshima, Japan. Mazda is the 15th largest car maker in the world, and 12th largest in U.S. sales. The company was started in 1920. Today it has about 44,000 employees. Sales are 2,057,614,000,000 yen. 1920
History.
In 1920, Toyo Koruku Kogyo was established. In 1984, it changed its name to Mazda. The company is unique in using rotary engines in some of its cars. A rotary engine has more power for its weight than ordinary engines. In 1991, the Mazda 787B (which had a rotary engine) won the 24 Heures du LeMans. From 1979 to 2010, Mazda had a partnership with Ford Motor Company. At one point, Ford owned 1/3 of Mazda's stock. Since 2000, Mazda has grown, especially in Europe and North America, and it is now completely separate from Ford. In 2015, Mazda and Toyota agreed to work together.
Brand.
Mazda produces cars only in Japan and Mexico, but 80% of its sales are outside of Japan. Mazda is the only company that produces cars which have rotary engines (but most of its cars do not have rotary engines). The cars are popular in Australia and Europe, especially Germany and U.K. Nowadays, Mazda's slogan is ZOOM-ZOOM. It is famous for the movie Only Strong. ZOOM-ZOOM comes from English-speaking children calling cars ZOOM-ZOOM. 
Name.
Mazda's company name is derived from Matsuda Jujirou who was the founder of this company, and the Zoroastrian god, Ahura Mazda. Ahura Mazda is a symbol of wisdom, reason, and harmony.

Animal testing, also known as animal experimentation and animal research is the use of animals for experiments. Escherichia coli, Fruit flies, and mice are often used for animal testing. About 50 to 100 million vertebrate animals and many more invertebrate animals are used around the world every year. The source of the animals are different according to the country and species. Most animals used for experiments are bred for this purpose. But others may be caught from the wild or bought from people who buy them from animal shelters.
Animals are used for experiments inside universities, medical schools, farms, large companies and other places that provide animal-testing services. People who support animal testing argue that almost every medical discovery in the 20th century used animals in some way. They say that even complex computers cannot model connections between molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms, and the environment. Many important discoveries were made because of animal testing. But some scientists and animal rights organizations such as PETA do not support animal testing. They say that it is cruel, poorly done, and costly. Others argue that animals have the right not to be used for experiments, and that model organisms are different from humans. The limits to animal testing is different in various countries.
Definitions.
The words animal testing, animal experimentation, animal research, "in vitro" testing, and vivisection have similar meanings,differently. "tatiosion" means to "cut up" a living animal. It was used only in experiments that dissected live animals. The word "vivisection" is sometimes used negatively about any experiment with live animals. For example, the "Encyclopædia Britannica" described "vivisection" as: "Operation on a living animal for experimental rather than healing purposes; more broadly, all experimentation on live animals". However, dictionaries note that the wider definition is "used only by people who are opposed (dislike) to such work". The word makes people think of torture, pain, and death. People who dislike animal testing often use the word "vivisection", while scientists usually use the expression "animal experimentation" instead.
History.
The earliest mention of animal testing is in the writings of the Greeks in the second and fourth centuries BCE. Aristotle (�����������) (384 – 322 BCE) and Erasistratus (304 – 258 BCE) where some of the first people to try out experiments on living animals. Galen, a doctor in second-century Rome who was known as the "father of vivisection", dissected pigs and goats. Avenzoar, an Arabic doctor in twelfth-century Spain, tested out surgical processes on animals before applying them to humans.
Animals have often been used in the history of scientific study. In the 1880s, Louis Pasteur showed the germ theory of medicine by putting anthrax in sheep. In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning. On November 3, 1957, a Russian dog, Laika, became the first animal to orbit the earth. In the 1970s, antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were made using armadillos, then given to humans. In 1974, Rudolf Jaenisch produced the first genetically changed mammal. He put DNA from a virus into the genome of mice. Genetic study grew quickly after that. In 1996, Dolly the sheep was born—the first cloned mammal.
In the 20th century, toxicology testing became important. In the 19th century, laws about drugs were less strict. Drugs did not have to be checked for safety. But in 1937, a drug called Elixir Sulfanilamide killed more than 100 people. They caused great and long lasting pain, vomiting, and fits. After that, the U.S. congress made laws that said that drugs had to be tested on animals before they could be sold. Other countries passed similar laws.
Even back in the 17th century, people disagreed about animal testing. In 1655, Edmund O'Meara said that "the miserable torture of vivisection places the body in an unnatural state." O'Meara and others said that animals could be affected by pain during vivisection, making results unreliable. Others also disliked animal testing because they felt that animals should not be hurt for humans. Others opposed animal testing for different reasons: many believed that animals were not as good as humans and that they were so different that results of animal testing would not work on humans.
Supporters had different views. They argued that experiments on animals were necessary for knowledge. Claude Bernard, the "prince of vivisectors" and the father of physiology famously wrote in 1865 that "the science of life is a superb and dazzlingly (brightly) lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly kitchen". He declared that "experiments on entirely conclusive for the toxicology and hygiene of effects of these substances are the same on man as on animals, save for differences in degree". Because of Bernard, animal testing became a regular scientific method. Surprisingly, though, his wife, Marie Françoise Martin, began the first anti-vivisection society in France in 1883.
In 1896, Dr. Walter B. Cannon said, “The antivivisectionists are the second of the two types Theodore Roosevelt described when he said, ‘Common sense without conscience may lead to crime, but conscience without common sense may lead to folly, which is the handmaiden (servant) of crime.’ ” The public first began giving its attention to the supporters and opposers of animal testing during the brown dog affair in the early 1990s. In the brown dog affair, hundreds of medical students and anti-vivisectionists and police argued over a memorial to a vivisected dog.

 was the 123rd emperor of Japan according to the traditional order of succession. His reign started in 30 July 1912 and ended with his death in 1926. He was Emperor of Japan from 1912-1926 he was also involved in World War 1 to fight against the German Empire (Empire of Germany) and was allies with the British Empire,French Third Republic,and Portuguese Empire,Australia to fight against Kaiser Wilhelm II from 1914-1918 .

Emperor Taishō (meaning "Great Justice") was the name given to Yoshihito at the time of his coronation. Emperors of Japan receive a new name at the time of their coronation, and people start using the new name, both to refer to the emperor himself and the name of the era during which he reigned.
Events of Taishō's life.
Taishō's early life was marked by many changes in the role of emperor; and his reign was a period of consolidation.

Trivium is a heavy metal band from Orlando, Florida. They started in 1999 and became very successful. The members are: Matt Heafy (vocals, guitars), Corey Beaulieu (guitars), Paolo Gregoletto (bass) and Alex Bent (drums). 

The word trivium, from Latin, is made of two parts. The first part "tres" meant "three" and the second part "vía" meant "way". 
In antiquity and the High Middle Ages, there were different ways of teaching young men at the university. The trivium was three simplest ways to study the world, and so young men learned them first. After the trivium, they studied the quadrivium. Together, these subjects were called the seven liberal arts. The most difficult, and final subject studied was theology.
The three subjects were related to talking about the world. These subjects were grammar, logic and rhetoric. They were ways of preparing for the quadrivium, which includes arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy.
Grammar.
One way of studying the world is to look at the form of the words. Grammar is the mechanics of the language.
When a man studied grammar, he studied how words were put together, and how words were combined to make sentences, paragraphs, chapters, and stories.
The word "grammar" has a more limited meaning now than it did before now. Many subjects, such as syntax and phonetics were part of grammar.
Logic.
One way of studying the world is to look at the meaning of words. Logic is the mechanics of thought and analysis. Logic is the study of how meanings are related to each other, and how to make good decisions. A fallacy is when someone does not draw a conclusion according to the rules of logic. An old name for logic was dialectics.
Rhetoric.
One way of studying the world is to look at communicating with words. Rhetoric is the mechanics of discourse. Discourse is the process of two or more people communicating about an idea. Young men studied rhetoric in order to learn how to instruct and to persuade. 

The London School of Economics and Political Science (more commonly London School of Economics or LSE) is a college of the University of London in Westminster. The college opened in 1895. It joined the University of London in 1900. Today it is one of the leading universities for Law, Economics and Political Sciences. QS ranked it as the second best university in the world for social science in 2013. 
Some of the most notable people who attended the college are:
It is a member of the Russell Group. In 2011 17,654 people applied for 1,271 undergraduate places. This means there were 13.8 applicants for every place. Over half of LSE's students are postgraduates. 16 Nobel Prize winners have been LSE students or staff. It has the highest percentage of students from another country in the world and 46% of staff are from other countries.

The Ancient Olympic Games were a series of athletic competitions held between the city-states of Ancient Greece. They used to be called the Olympic Games (; "Olympiakoi Agones") until the modern day Olympic Games started. The Ancient Olympic Games began in 776 BC in Olympia, Greece.
Prizes at the games were olive wreaths, palm branches and woollen ribbons. The ancient Olympics were played in the honour of the God Zeus. 
Women were not allowed to participate or even to see the competitions.
There is no agreement on when the Games officially ended, but many historians think it is 393 AD, when the Christian Roman emperor Theodosius I declared that all Pagan religious practices should end. Another date might be 426 AD, when the next emperor Theodosius II ordered the destruction of all Greek temples. The stadium in Olympia got buried by landslides and other natural disasters. After the Olympics stopped, they were not held again until the modern Olympic Games were started in 1896 in Athens.
Famous athletes.
Here are athletes that competed at the Games:

Tao (Pinyin Dào ) is a metaphysical concept found in Taoism, Confucianism, and more often in ancient Chinese philosophy. The Chinese character translates as "way," "path," or "route,". In Taoism, the Tao was the origin of the whole universe. Taoists believe that the "myriad things", or everything in the universe from animals to materials to ideas, originally came from the Tao, and when something disappears, it's energy (or "qi") goes back to the Tao to be absorbed and re-birthed in a different form. 
The Tao is a cosmic force that can't be named or described, which is the natural harmony between all living things, and the way they all move together. Taoists thought that if someone "forgot themselves", and let go of intentions, they would be able to "move effortlessly" (wu wei, or "non-action"), and be in harmony with the Tao, like the animals, plants, and everything else. This harmony is the ultimate goal of Taoism.

Vitis is a genus of about 60 species of vining plants in the flowering plant family Vitaceae. The genus is made up of species most often found in the Northern hemisphere. It is economically important as the source of grapes, both for direct consumption of the fruit and for fermentation to produce wine. The cultivation of grapevines is called viticulture. A farm or garden where grapes are grown is a vineyard.

Sulfur dioxide (also sulphur dioxide) is the chemical compound with the formula SO2. It is a gas. It smells like burnt matches or rotten eggs. It can also cause suffocation. Sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanoes and in various industrial processes. It is also used to protect wine from oxygen and bacteria. It can be produced by burning sulfur. It dissolves in water to produce sulfurous acid. It can be oxidized to trioxide, which is dissolved in sulfuric acid to make more sulfuric acid. It is used to make sulfites.

Human nature refers to the characteristics of mankind. This means ways of thinking, feeling and acting which humans have naturally.
What these characteristics are, what causes them and how fixed human nature is, are good questions. They among the oldest and most important questions in western philosophy. These questions affect ethics, politics and theology. Human nature is a source of advice on how to live well, but it also puts limits and obstacles on living a good life.
The complex implications of such questions are also dealt with in art and literature, while the humanities inquire into human nature, and what it means to be human.
Theories of human nature.
Many great thinkers have had definite ideas on human nature, but some ideas have lasted better than others. An example of this is the best-selling college textbook which first appeared in 1974 as "Seven theories of human nature". The seven theories were those of:
Thirty years later the selection was of ten theories:
Aristotle.
Aristotle, Plato's most famous student, made some of the most famous and influential statements about human nature.
In his works some clear statements about human nature are made:
For Aristotle, reason is what is most special about humanity compared to other animals, and is what we achieve at our best.
Much of Aristotle's description of human nature is still influential today, but the particular teleological idea that humans are "meant" or intended to be something, has become much less popular in modern times.
Biological theories.
Humans are mammals, and have developed by a process of evolution. It follows that what is called human nature is inherited, and had been the product of natural selection. We are not blank slates; our mental life and behaviour has ancient roots. This is the question of nature vs nurture, and the subject-matter of evolutionary psychology. Ethology and sociobiology has also looked at these issues from the perspective of human evolution and heredity.

A belly dance is a Middle Eastern type of dancing. In the Arabic language, it is called raqs sharqi (which means "oriental dance"). Many boys and girls in countries where belly dancing is popular will learn how to do it when they are young. The dance involves movement of many different parts of the body; usually in a circular way.
The term "Belly dance" is translated from the French language "danse du ventre". However, this dance is done by every part of the body. The most featured body part usually is the hips. Belly dancing is very different depending on country and region, both in costume and dance style.
History.
Belly dancing came from the dances performed in the Middle East and North Africa. One theory is that belly dance may have come from Arabia, a dance when the pagan Arabs were worshipping a goddess before the rise of Islam. A third theory is that belly dance was always danced just for entertainment.
Another theory is that belly dance was originally danced by women for women in the Levant, and North Africa.
The courtly pleasures of the Muslim Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs included belly dancing, soirée, and singing. Belly dancers and singers were sent from all parts of the vast Arab Empire to entertain.
Belly dance was taken from Egypt by the Roma people to Turkey.

His mother was a cleaner who was unmarried and she raised him with the help of her mother and he knew his father and he was hard to control because of his antisocial behaviour along with his brother and he was taken with his brother into local authority care when he was 10 years old. Although a Protestant he went to a Roman Catholic school. He got in trouble at school as a child, he also often ran away and went to London to clubs where his glam rock career started and he started calling himself Paul Raven in 1960 when his glam rock career started and then Gary Glitter in 1971 which he is known as. He has become infamous after being convicted of possessing child pornography and of child sexual abuse.

He was briefly married to Anne Merton with who he had a son called Paul and a daughter called Sarah but Glitter and Merton divorced. Later when he lived in Cuba he had a Cuban girlfriend called Yudenia Sosa Martinez with who he had another son in 2001 called Gary Glitter Jr. In the 1970s Giltter was also convicted of driving under the influence and had used drugs such as cocaine and had a drug overdose.
Glitter - who became a vegetarian and embraced Buddhism - lived in Cambodia until 2002 when he was extradited to Vietnam where he was sentenced to three years jail in early 2006 for child sex offences he committed in Vietnam but on appeal twice with his Vietnamese lawyer he was released in November 2008.

Swallows and Amazons is a series of children's books by the English writer Arthur Ransome. The series is named after the title of the first book in the series. The 12 books are about the adventures of groups of children during school holidays. Events mostly take place in England and Scotland between the World War I and World War II. The stories usually are about outdoor activities, especially camping, fishing and sailing.
Overview.
The series remains popular today for its lovely, yet often realistic, depiction of childhood and the interplay between children's imagination and reality. It is part of the basis for a large tourist industry in the Lake District and Norfolk Broads areas of England, where many of the books are set. There are also several groups dedicated to the study and promotion of Ransome's work which are largely inspired by the series. The first was the Arthur Ransome Club in Japan. There is also the British-based group, The Arthur Ransome Society, which has an international membership.
The series begins with "Swallows and Amazons", published in 1930. It tells the story of the Walker children, who sail a dinghy (boat) named "Swallow", and the Blackett children, who sail a dinghy named "Amazon". The Walkers are staying at a farm near a lake during the school holidays; the Blacketts live in a house on the opposite shore. The children meet on an island on the lake, and have a series of adventures that weave imaginative tales of pirates and exploration into everyday life in inter-war, rural England.

Arthur Michell Ransome (born 18 January 1884 in Leeds - died 3 June 1967) was an English writer and journalist. He is best known for writing the "Swallows and Amazons series" of children's books. 
Ransome was born in Leeds. His father was Professor of History there. His father's death in 1897 affected Ransome for a long time. He always tried to get past his belief that his father had did not think his abilities were very good.
Ransome got his formal education first in Windermere. He then studied at the Rugby School (where he lived in Lewis Carroll's study room). He did not fully like his time there because of his poor vision, lack of skills at sports, and limited achievement. He attended Yorkshire College, his father's college studying chemistry. After a year there, he stopped going to the college. He went to London to become a writer. He took low-paying jobs as an office assistant in a publishing company. He also worked as editor of a magazine, "Temple Bar Magazine", that was not making much money. During this time, he was writing and became a member of the literary scene of London.
"Swallows and Amazons".
Ransom's most well known book series, "Swallows and Amazons", tells the stories of school-holiday adventures of children. The stories are mostly set in the Lake District and the Norfolk Broads. Many of the books involve sailing. Other common things are fishing and camping. The books are so popular that they give a basis of a tourist industry around Windermere and Coniston Water — the two lakes that Ransome used as the basis for his fictional North Country lake.

The Stanley Cup playoffs are an elimination tournament in the National Hockey League.
To win the Stanley Cup, a team must win 16 playoff games, 4 in each of the 4 rounds. 
The playoffs have 4 rounds. Each round is a best-of-seven series. This means up to seven games are played until one team wins 4 of the games. The first three rounds decide which team from each conference will move on to the last round. The last round is called the Stanley Cup Finals. The winner of that set of games becomes the NHL and Stanley Cup winner. 
The first round of the playoffs is called the Conference Quarterfinals. There are four games in each conference. The winners of the first round advance to the second round. The third round is the Conference Finals. The two teams left in each conference (Eastern Conference and Western Conference) play each other. The conference champions advance to the Stanley Cup Finals.
For the first three rounds, the higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Finals, it goes to the team with the better regular season record. The team with home-ice advantage hosts games 1, 2, 5 and 7, while the opponent hosts games 3, 4 and 6 (games 5–7 are played "if needed").
Unlike regular season games, which have an altered format for overtime games (3 skaters and a goalie per side), playoff games have regular squads (5 skaters and a goalie per side) and are all played as sudden death format.
History.
Before the 1993–94 season, the style was completely different. The league was split into four divisions, and the best four teams in each of the divisions went to the playoffs. Also, instead of the top team playing the 8th place team in the conference, the first place team played the fourth place team in each division, and the second place team played the third place team. In the second round, the two winning teams in each division would face each other for the divisional championship. The divisional winners in each conference would play one another in the third round for the right to advance to the Stanley Cup Final. This style is still used for deciding the teams in the playoffs in the American Hockey League.

The Latin alphabet in Turkic countries is the common alphabet officially used in most countries with Turkic languages. Turkic languages can also be written in Arabic, Persian and Cyrillic.
History.
After World War I, many Turkic countries implemented a policy of westernization, centered even on the use of the Latin alphabet.
The first was Turkey in 1928, where Kemal Atatürk substituted the Arab alphabet with the Roman alphabet after ordering the end of the Ottoman Empire.
Soon all the Turkic-speaking countries of the Soviet Central Asia did the same and used the so-called "unified Turkish Latin alphabet" based on the one of Atatürk's Turkey, but during WWII, Stalin ordered a Russification process in his Soviet Union and the Latin alphabet was replaced again by the Cyrillic alphabet.
After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, most of the newly independent Turkic Asian countries put back the Latin alphabet. There are small differences between each country's alphabet.
Letters of Latin alphabet.
The Turkish alphabet used in Turkey, based on Latin capital and lower case letters, has 29 letters (but other countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have more letters). Unusual among languages that use the Latin alphabet, Turkish has both a dotted and dotless version of the letter "I".
Of these 29 letters in the Latin alphabet of Turkey, 8 are vowels (A, E, I, İ, O, Ö, U, Ü); the 21 others are consonants. The letters Q, W, and X of the English alphabet do not occur in this Turkish Latin alphabet, and, in fact, were once illegal in Turkey.
The Turkish alphabet used in other Turkic countries, like Kazakhstan, when using Latin alphabet like in the case of Qazaqsa, has some different letters.
For example, the Qazaqsa Latin alphabet has 38 letters:

The Church of Scotland is the national church of Scotland, established by law. It is Presbyterian. The Presbyterian Church of Scotland is distinguished from the Anglican Church in a number of ways. It does not have bishops or archbishops; nor is the British monarch its head. The leading minister is called the Moderator, who is the chair of the General Assembly for one year. Ministers of the Kirk, as it is called, may be called Rectors.
The established kirk has suffered schism (breaks), and this has given rise to the "Wee Frees": the Free Church of Scotland, and (a further schism) the Free Church of Scotland (continuing) (the Wee Wee Frees); and the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland (also, confusingly, called the Wee Wee Frees). 
The Scottish Presbyterian church was formed when it broke away from Rome in 1560. Its theology (beliefs) were based on the ideas of John Knox, a disciple of John Calvin. The free kirks tend to take the Bible more literally. 
About 10% of the people in Scotland are members of this church, but when asked in a census, 47% of people said this was their religion.
In 2023 there were around 4500 churches in Scotland, but fewer people going to services, so there were plans to save money by closing many of them.
God's Invitation.
In 1992, the Kirk's ruling body (the General Assembly) approved the following simple summary of its beliefs.

Totemism is a belief about the relationship between people and nature. The term totem comes from an Ojibwe word meaning “a relative of mine”. It was first written about in 1791 by a trader, James Long. It has been recorded across native tribes of America, Africa and Australia. It has been the subject of much research into ethnic groups. Usually, totems of a kinship group will be animals or plants. They will be represented in sacred objects and will belong exclusively to them.
Early records.
Totemism was considered a primitive religion by many European thinkers in the 1800s. It was thought to be related to beliefs about food and incest taboos. In 1869, John Ferguson McLennan said that "there is no race of men that has not come through this primitive stage of speculative belief". Early thinkers had the idea that beliefs in totemism came from indiginous clans being uneducated about the difference between humans and animals. This is not still talked about as true in modern discussions on totemism.
Totem poles.
Totem poles are carved with symbols on large trees, mostly cedar or spruce, by native northwest North American clans. Totem poles are also found in Alaska. They are not for worship, but early missionaries had them burned down. This was a mistake because the poles just tell stories about the clan they belong to. Eagles or ravens are carved at the highest level. Lower down the pole are carved beavers, foxes, bears and frogs. A carving of a person is located on top. He is the watchman, who warns about approaching danger in the village.
History of totemic theory.
Émile Durkheim said in 1915 that totemism was just a way of thinking about groups in society. Durkheim decided this because he spent time working with Aboriginal Australian clans. Each clan had its own totem, which could be any natural feature such as animals, plants or rivers. These totems and symbols of them were worshiped and protected. This was because only as long as the totem was healthy would the clan stay healthy. Durkheim decided that the worship of the totems was a type of self-worship for the clan. 
Claude Lévi-Strauss published "Totemism" in 1962. In this book he says that totemism is a way that humans tend to classify people into similar groups. Once a population has made rules like exogamy (marrying outside the group) it becomes important to keep the clan different from others. But humans themselves do not have different features like wolves or birds do, so giving the identity of an animal to the clan makes its member distinctly different. This makes social boundaries.

Neocolonialism is a system where empires pretend to let their colonies be free, but they continue to run them secretly. The term "neo" means "new", so it means that the system is a new version of colonialism. The word neocolonialism was carefully explained by socialists in the 1960s, who were afraid their countries wouldn't really be independent. The socialists mostly talked about the old empires controlling the politics and economy of their countries, but some people also talk about neocolonialism as a way to control culture too.
Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana after it became independent from the British Empire, wrote a well-known book about neocolonialism. Many people have heard of the idea because of his book. Che Guevara is another famous opponent of neocolonialism.
Most people who use the word neocolonialism and believe it describes the world today are socialists, anti-imperialists, and other types of leftists. Liberals and right-wing people tend to disagree with the idea of neocolonialism.

Ocala is a city in Marion County, Florida. In 2020, the number of people recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau was 63,591. It is the county seat of Marion County, and the principal city of the Ocala, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area, which in the 2020 census had a population of 375,908.
History.
Ocala is found near the old site of Ocale or Ocali, a major Timucua village and chiefdom during the 16th century. The city of Ocala today borrowed the name from the village. The name is believed to mean "Big Hammock" in the Timucua language. Hernando de Soto passed through Ocale during his famous journey through what is today the southeastern United States in 1539. Ocale is not mentioned in any later accounts; it seems to have been abandoned in the wake of de Soto's attack.
In 1827 the U.S. army outpost of Fort King was built near the current site of Ocala as a buffer between Seminoles and white settlers. The fort saw service during the Second Seminole War and was later used as the first courthouse for Marion County in 1844. Fort King was the beginning of the current city of Ocala, which was established in 1846. Greater Ocala is known as the "Kingdom of the Sun". Rail service reached Ocala in June 1881, encouraging economic development. Two years later, much of the Ocala downtown area was destroyed by a fire on Thanksgiving Day, 1883. Buildings were rebuilt with brick, granite and steel rather than lumber. By 1888, Ocala was known state-wide as "The Brick City".
In December 1890, the Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union, an early version of the Populist Party held its national meeting in Ocala. At the meeting, the Alliance adopted a platform that would become known as the "Ocala Demands". This platform included removal of national banks, low interest government loans, free and limitless coinage of silver, reclamation of excess railroad lands taken by the government, a graduated income tax, and direct election of United States senators. Most of the "Ocala Demands" were to become part of the Populist Party platform.
Ocala was an important center of citrus production until the Great Freeze of 1894-1895.
In the twentieth century, Ocala increased in fame as a center for tourism in Florida. Important attractions included the Silver Springs Nature Theme Park, Wild Waters water park, and the now-defunct Western-themed Six Gun Territory, all in nearby Silver Springs, Florida. (See Six Gun Territory Gallery.) Silver Springs is a nature theme park that surrounds the headwaters of the Silver River, the largest artesian spring formation in the world.
The first thoroughbred horse farm in Florida was created by Carl G. Rose in 1943. Earlier, in 1916, Rose had come to Florida from Indiana to oversee the first asphalt road ever constructed in the state. When he ran into problems with the asphalt, he tried to work with one of Florida's abundant resources: limestone. He also realized that the limestone would be a good source of nutrition for raising strong horses, so he took a gamble in 1943 and bought acreage along State Highway 200 at $10 per acre, which became Rosemere Farm. The next year one of his horses, Gornil, won at Miami's Tropical Park, making him the first Florida-raised thoroughbred to win a Florida race. Close on Rose's heels, the entrepreneur Bonnie Heath soon set up his own thoroughbred horse farm and produced the state's first Kentucky Derby winner. Both of these men have major highways named after them in Ocala. Bonnie Heath Farm is now owned and operated by his son Bonnie Heath, III, and his wife Kim. Rosemere Farm was sold long ago, and Ocala's Paddock Mall and Central Florida College were built on the site.
In 1956, the Ocala area Thoroughbred market received a raise when Needles became the first Florida-bred to win the Kentucky Derby. In 1978, Marion County-bred and -raised Affirmed won the Triple Crown. Today, Marion County is one of the major thoroughbred centers of the world, with over 1,200 horse farms in total and about 900 thoroughbred farms totaling some . Ocala is well known as the horse capital of the world, one of only five cities (four in the USA and one in France) allowed under Chamber of Commerce guidelines to use this title based on yearly money produced by the horse industry. There are some 44,000 jobs created by the breeding, training and related support brought about by the horse industry that generates over $2.2 billion in yearly money. Ocala and "Postime Farms" also support one of the biggest horse shows in the country. H.I.T.S or "Horses in the Sun" is a Dressage/Jumper event lasting about two months and brings with it some 6 to 7 million dollars to the local Marion county economy each year. There are over 100 different breeds aside from thoroughbreds including the Tennessee Walker, Paso Fino, Morgans, SaddleBreds, Drafts, and the American Quarter Horse. Other horse events in the area include cowboy mounted shooting by the Florida Outlaws, as well as endurance rides, barrel races, "extreme" cowboy events, jumper shows, trick shows, parades, draft pulls, and more.
Ocala began undergoing rapid growth in the 1970s with the development of the Interstate 75 and the founding of Disney World, located some southeast.
In the last decades of the twentieth century, the greater Ocala area experienced one of the highest growth rates in the country for a city its size. The population of Marion County in 2000 was over 250,000, up from under 100,000 in 1975. Much of the county's growth is attributable to the area's growing popularity as a retirement destination, primarily in two areas southwest and south of the city: the SR 200 corridor and The Villages, respectively.
Many historic homes are preserved in Ocala's large housing Historic District, established in 1984. A focus of this district is East Fort King Street, featuring many excellent examples of Victorian architecture. Ocala structures on the National Register of Historic Places include the Coca Cola Building, the E. C. Smith House, East Hall, the Marion Hotel, Mount Zion A.M.E. Church, the Ritz Historic Inn, and Union Train Station.
The original Fort King site itself was called a National Historic Landmark in 2004.
Government and Politics.
Ocala is governed by a five member board of councilors and a mayor, all of which are chosen without caring about their party. Its charter was written in the council-manager form, leaving the mayor with few powers other than refusing legislation passed by the council and tending to some duties involving the police department. The city manager handles most leadership and money issues. Although a small majority of the city's voters are Democrats, Ocala's politics match those of the rest of Marion County in that all of its elected legislators - with one exception - are registered Republicans. In the 2008 presidential election, John McCain carried both the city and the county, the second one by a landslide, even though they lost Florida as a whole to Barack Obama by a narrow margin.
Geography.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The surrounding farms are famous for their thoroughbred horses, in terrain similar to Kentucky bluegrass. Ocala is also known for nearby Silver Springs, Florida, site of one of the largest artesian spring formations in the world and Silver Springs Nature Theme Park, one of the earliest tourist attractions in Florida.
The long Ocklawaha River flows north from Central Florida until it joins the St. Johns River near Palatka, Florida.
Marion County is also home to the Ocala National Forest which was established in 1908 and is now the second largest national forest in the state. The Florida Trail, also known as the Florida National Scenic Trail, cuts through Ocala National Forest.
Silver River State Park was established in the early 1990s to preserve the areas around the Silver River to the east of Ocala near Silver Springs.
Weather.
Ocala has two main seasons: the dry season (October–May) and the wet season (June–September). During the dry season, there is almost endless sunshine with very little rain. In January, the morning low temperatures are often in the 30s and 40s, but the cloudless sunny weather typically warms the dry air up to near 70 by the afternoon. During the wet season, afternoon thunderstorms are a daily thing. These storms are often severe (unofficially, Ocala is known to have more cloud-to-ground lightning per square mile than any other city in the world). The typical morning low temperatures during the wet season are in the 70's and typical daytime high temperatures are in the 90s. Due to the city being relatively far away from the moderating influence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, Ocala's summertime temperatures are often the highest in the state while winter temperatures are often the lowest compared to other cities on the peninsula. Also, Ocala's distance from the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico means the city has more days of sunshine than Florida's coastal cities. This is, in part, why the Ocala/Marion County area is called "the kingdom of the sun." The last snowfall of any significance fell on December 24, 1989, when the city was struck by an ice and snow storm. However, the morning of January 9, 2010, there was a dusting of snow on the ground in city center. A plume of record cold air mixed with moisture caused wintry precipitation to erupt across northern and central Florida.
Demographics.
As of the census of 2020, there were 63,591 people living in the city. There were 28,284 housing units, of which 25,531 were occupied (90.3%). The racial makeup of the city was 60.0% White, 19.3% African American, 0.3% Native American, 3.9% Asian, 5.3% from other races, and 11.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 17.1% of the population.
Economy.
In 2022, the median income for a household in the city was about $44,756, and the median income for a family was about $53,917. The per capita income for the city was about $24,066. About 23.1% of people were below the poverty line, including 32.1% of those under age 18 and 19.4% of those age 65 or over.

An undulator is an insertion device from high-energy physics and usually part of a larger installation, a synchrotron storage ring. It is a periodic structure of dipole magnets. A static magnetic field is alternating along the length of the undulator with a wavelength formula_1. Electrons traversing the periodic magnet structure are forced to oscillate. So the electrons give off energy as electronmagnetic radiation. The radiation produced in an undulator is very intense and concentrated in narrow energy bands in the spectrum. The light beam is also collimated on the orbit plane of the electrons. This radiation is guided through beamlines for experiments in various scientific areas.
The important dimensionless parameter 
formula_2 
where "e" is the particle charge, "B" is the magnetic field, "formula_3", "formula_4" is the electron rest mass and "c" is the speed of light, characterizes the nature of the electron motion. For formula_5 the oscillation amplitude of the motion is small and the radiation displays interference patterns which lead to narrow energy bands. If formula_6 the oscillation amplitude is bigger and the radiation contributions from each field period sum up independently, leading to a broad energy spectrum. When K is much bigger than 1, the device is no longer called an "undulator"; it is called a wiggler.
Physicist think about undulators both using classical physics and relativity. This means that though the precision calculation is tedious the undulator can be seen as a black box. An electron enters this box and an electromagnetic pulse exits through a small exit slit. The slit should be small enough so that only the main cone passes, so that the side lobes may be ignored. 
Undulators can provide hundreds of time more magnetic flux than a simple bending magnet and as such are in high demand at synchrotron radiation facilities. For an undulator that repeat N times (N periods), the brightness can be up to formula_7 more than a bending magnet. The intensity is enhanced up to a factor of N at harmonic wavelengths due to the constructive interference of the fields emitted during the N radiation periods. The usual pulse is a sine wave with some envelope. The second factor of N comes from the reduction of the emission angle associated with these harmonics, which is reduced in proportion to 1/N. When the electrons come with half the period, they interfere destructively. So, the undulator stays dark. The same is true if the electrons come as a bead chain. Because the bunch of electron spreads out the more times that they travel around the synchrotron, physicists want to design new machines that throw out the electron bunches before they have a chance to spread out. This change will produced more useful synchrotron radiation.
The polarization of the emitted radiation can be controlled by using permanent magnets to induce different periodic electron trajectories through the undulator. If the oscillations are confined to a plane the radiation will be linearly polarized. If the oscillation trajectory is helical, the radiation will be circularly polarized, with the handedness determined by the helix.
If the electrons follow the Poisson distribution, a partial interference leads to a linear increase in intensity.
In the free-electron laser the intensity increases exponentially with the number of electrons. 
Physicists measure an undulator's effectiveness in terms of spectral radiance.
History.
The first undulator was built by Hans Motz and his coworkers at Stanford in 1953. One of their undulators produced the first ever coherent infrared radiation. Their total frequency range was from visible light down to millimeter waves. The Russian physicist V.L. Ginzburg showed that undulators could be made in principle in a 1947 paper.

Imaginaerum is the seventh album by the Finnish symphonic metal group Nightwish. It is their second album with Swedish vocalist Anette Olzon. A movie of the same name was released in 2012. The movie has songs from the album in it. The album was No.1 in Finland.

Romania at the Olympics is a history which began in 1900.
The International Olympic Committee's official abbreviation for Romania was RUM. It is now ROU.
History.
A team from Romania was first at the Olympic Games in 1900. They had only one participant. The National Olympic Committee for Romania is the "Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee". It was formed and recognized in 1914. The nation first sent a team to the Games in 1924. They have been to each of the Summer Olympic Games and Winter Olympic Games since then except for two times. Notably, Romania was the lone Eastern Bloc nation to participate at the 1984 Summer Olympics, which the other nations boycotted. That was also Romania's most successful Olympic Games: they won 20 gold medals and 53 medals total.
Romanian athletes have won a total of 293 medals, with gymnastics as the top medal-producing sport.

Slovakia was first at the Olympic Games in 1994. They have been in every Games since then. Before Czechoslovakia broke up in 1993, Slovak athletes competed for Czechoslovakia at the Olympics.
Slovak athletes have won twenty medals altogether at the Summer Olympic Games. These were mostly for canoeing. The nation has also won four medals at the Winter Olympic Games.
The National Olympic Committee for Slovakia was made in 1992 and recognized in 1993.

Sweden was first at the Olympic Games at the inaugural 1896 Games. They have been in every Games since then with one exception for the 1904 Summer Olympics. Sweden has earned medals at all Olympic games except for two, the 1896 Games and the 1904 Games.
Sweden hosted the Games on one occasion, the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. The equestrian events of the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne were held in Stockholm, due to quarantine reasons.
Swedish athletes have a total of 475 medals at the Summer Olympic Games, and another 118 at the Winter Olympic Games.
The International Olympic Committee had Swedish officer and sports instructor Viktor Balck as one of its original members. The Swedish Olympic Committee was formed and recognized in 1913.
Sweden's Olympic Games bids.
Swedish Winter Olympic Games bids.
2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 Winter Games bids were declared non-finished applications by the Swedish Olympic Committee, due lack of political support from the Swedish government. The reason has been that the bidding is financially insecure for the Swedish society as a nation. 2018 Winter Olympic Games bids were promised support by the former government, but when the new government was elected, the bid was withdrawn. Östersund and Åre were the only applicant cities.

RTI Colombia (Radio Televisión Interamericana - in Spanish; Inter-American Radio and Television) is a Colombian television production company. Many of its series are co-produced with Telemundo, their strategic partner from the United States whose owner is NBC.

Henry Grattan (3 July 1746 – 6 June 1820) was an Irish politician. He was a member of the Irish House of Commons. He wanted changes such as Catholic Emancipation and more self government for the kingdom. He did not believe that Ireland and Great Britain should become a single country. He was one of the people who were most important in creating the constitution of 1782. This gave Ireland self-government. He was also important in ending Poynings law of 1494 and the Declaratory Act of 1720. 

Ukraine sent athletes to the Olympic Games for the first time as an independent nation in 1994. It has sent athletes to every Summer Olympic Games and Winter Olympic Games since then.
Before 1994, Ukrainian athletes were a part of the Soviet Union at the Olympics from 1952 to 1988. After the Soviet Union ended, Ukraine was part of the Unified Team in 1992.
Ukraine has won a total of 116 medals at the Summer Games and five at the Winter Games. Gymnastics has been the nation's best sport.
The National Olympic Committee of Ukraine was created in 1990. It was accepted by the International Olympic Committee in 1993.

Magnetic flux is a measure of the magnetic field lines passing through a surface, such as a loop of wire. The magnetic flux through a closed surface such as a sphere is always zero, because the magnetic field lines going into the closed surface are balanced by field lines coming out.
It is the alignment of electrons in the atomic shells of ferromagnets and the “spinning” electrons in electromagnets, that provides a material with it’s magnetism.
The SI unit of magnetic flux is the Weber (Wb; in derived units, volt-seconds). The CGS unit is the Maxwell.
Magnetic flux is sometimes used by electrical engineers designing systems with electromagnets or designing dynamos. Physicists designing particle accelerators also calculate magnetic flux.

Fess Elisha Parker, Jr. (August 16, 1924 – March 18, 2010), was an American actor.
Career.
His first movie was "Harvey" (1950) with James Stewart. Over the years, he worked on movies with many well known actors. These include Gary Cooper, Bob Hope, Jeff Chandler and Steve McQueen.
Fess Parker work for Disney on two movies about Davy Crockett In 1964, NBC hired him to do a television series about Daniel Boone. The series was about the Boone and his fights against the Indians and the redcoats in the American Revolution. The cast of the series included of Patricia Blair as Rebecca Boone, Albert Salmi as Yadkin, Ed Ames as Mingo, Roosevelt Grier as Gabe Cooper and Darby Hinton is Israel Boone. 159 episodes were made between 1964-1970.

To Catch a Predator is a television program designed to catch adults trying to have sex with children below the age of 16. People were lured to meet with a decoy under the pretense of sexual contact and then confronted. Show host Chris Hansen clarified in an interview with NPR News that these subjects should be labeled as potential sexual predators, and not pedophiles. "Pedophiles have a very specific definition, people who are interested in prepubescent sex," he stated. 
The series premiered in November 2004, and featured 12 investigations in total held across the United States. The investigations were conducted as undercover sting operations with the help of on-line watchdog group Perverted-Justice. Since the third installment, law enforcement and other officials were also involved, leading to the arrests of most individuals caught. No new episodes have aired since December 2007.
Rockwall County, Texas assistant district attorney Louis Conradt was caught sending pictures and messages to who he thought was a 13-year-old boy but was decoy from Perverted-Justice. When they tried to do a search warrant to his house, Conradt would commit suicide by shooting himself while the police and NBC crew were entering his house. The show would be cancelled afterwards.
NBC affiliates WTMJ in Milwaukee, KSHB in Kansas City and WBRE have also done local versions of "To Catch a Predator". Various spin-offs have aired in the same format, including "To Catch a Con Man", "To Catch an ID Thief", "To Catch a Car Thief" and "To Catch an i-Jacker", which featured iPod thieves. "To Catch a Predator" is also aired on FX and Crime &amp; Investigation Network in the United Kingdom, the Crime &amp; Investigation Network in Australia and New Zealand and FOX Crime in Portugal.
Later in 2016, Chris Hansen would host a similar segment called "Hansen vs. Predator" during episodes of "Crime Watch Daily".

Yugoslavia sent athletes to the Olympic Games for the first time in 1920. Before this, several athletes from Croatia, Slovenia and Vojvodina were on the Olympic teams of Austria or Hungary when those countries were part of the Empire of Austria-Hungary. A small team of two athletes been sent from the Serbia to the 1912 Summer Olympics.
"Yugoslavia" has been the name for Olympic teams from three distinct nations:
Two of the nations that were at one time part of Yugoslavia, (Croatia and Slovenia), started sending their own teams to the Olympics at the 1992 Winter Olympics. As of the 2008 Summer Olympics, all six former parts of Yugoslavia were sending their own teams to the Games.

These tables do not include "Yugoslavia" teams representing the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).

A telenovela, or simply novela, is a serial drama television program. It is popular in Latin American, Portuguese, and Spanish television programming. Telenovelas are different from soap operas, because unlike soap operas, telenovelas have an ending and do not run for many years. They usually come to an end after one television season (which is usually less than one year) or at most two television seasons (which is less than two years). Telenovelas rarely run more than two seasons. The telenovela combines drama with the 19th century "feuilleton" and the Latin American radionovela. They are often used to give cultural messages by adding them into storylines.
Because the telenovela is similar to the American soap opera, the telenovela is often called a "Spanish soap opera" in the United States. While most English language soap operas have no ending, almost all telenovelas run for a limited time. They are usually shown five or six days a week and run for an average of 120 episodes.

Harold Egbert Camping (July 19, 1921 – December 15, 2013) was an American Christian radio broadcaster. His parents were Dutch immigrants. He served as president of Family Radio, a California-based radio station group that broadcasts to more than 150 markets in the United States, since 1958. In 2011 he retired from active broadcasting following a stroke, but maintained a role at Family Radio until his death. Camping is notable for applying numerology to his interpretations of Bible passages in an attempt to predict dates for the End Times. 
His 2011 end times prediction was that on May 21, 2011 Jesus Christ would return to Earth, the righteous would fly up to heaven, and that there would follow five months of fire, brimstone and plagues on Earth, with millions of people dying each day, culminating on October 21, 2011 with the end of the world. He had previously predicted judgment days on May 21, 1988, and September 6, 1994.
His prediction for May 21, 2011 was widely reported, in part because of a massive publicity campaign by Family Radio, and it prompted responses from both atheist and Christian organizations. After May 21 passed without the predicted incidents, Camping said he believed that a "spiritual" judgment had occurred on that date, and that the physical Rapture would occur on October 21, 2011, simultaneously with the destruction of the universe by God. Except for one press appearance on May 23, 2011, Camping largely avoided press interviews after May 21, particularly after he suffered a stroke in June. October 21, 2011, passed without the predicted apocalypse, leading the International Business Times to proclaim Camping a "false prophet." 
Camping was reported to have retired from his position at Family Radio as of October 16, 2011, only days before his last predicted date for the end of the world. However, his daughter later clarified that he had not retired outright, but was maintaining a role at the Family Radio while working from home. Camping admitted in a private interview that he no longer believed that anybody could know the time of the Rapture or the end of the world, in stark contrast to his previously staunch position on the subject.

Coit Tower is a tower in the Telegraph Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California. The tower, in the city's Pioneer Park, was built in 1933. Lillie Hitchcock Coit left one-third of her estate to the city "to be expended in an appropriate manner for the purpose of adding to the beauty of the city which I have always loved".
The art deco tower is made of unpainted reinforced concrete. Architects Arthur Brown, Jr. and Henry Howard designed it. The tower has fresco murals by 27 different on-site artists and their assistants, plus two additional paintings installed after creation off-site.
The tower was not designed to resemble a fire hose nozzle, despite Coit's affinity with the San Francisco firefighters of the day, in particular with Knickerbocker Engine Company Number 5.

Lake Charles is the most populous city in the southwest Louisiana. It is the second most populous city in the Acadiana (after Lafayette). It is the fifth most populous city in the U.S. state of Louisiana (after New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Shreveport and Lafayette). The actual population is about 85,000. The city was founded as Charleston, March 7, 1861. The name was changed to Lake Charles on March 16, 1867. The city was founded by and named for Charles Sallier.

 (1328 – 29 March 1368) was the 97th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession. His reign started in September 1339 and ended on 29 March 1368..
This 14th century sovereign was named after the 10th century Emperor Murakami and "go-" (�), translates literally as "later"; and thus, he is sometimes called the "Later Emperor Murakami". The Japanese word "go" has also been translated to mean the "second one"; and in some older sources, this emperor may be identified as "Murakami, the second", or as "Murakami II".
Traditional narrative.
His personal name was , also known as Yoshiyoshi.
He reigned from Sumiyoshi, Ōsaka, Yoshino, Nara, and other temporary locations.
Events of Go-Murakami's life.
Prince Noriyoshi was a member of the Southern Court during the Nanboku-chō period of rival courts.
After his death.
According to the Imperial Household Agency, the mausoleum ("misasagi") of Go-Murakami is in Osaka Prefecture. The emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine in the precincts of Kanshinji temple (���) in Kawachinagano, Osaka.
Eras of Go-Murakami's reign.
The years of Go-Murakami's reign are more identified by more than one era name.

In mathematics, a surface integral is a definite integral taken over a surface (which may be a curve set in space). Just as a line integral allows one to integrate over an arbitrary curve (of one dimension), a surface integral can be thought of as a double integral integrating over a two-dimensional surface. Given a surface, one may integrate over its scalar fields (that is, functions which return numbers as values), or its vector fields (that is, functions which return vectors as values). 
Surface integrals have applications in physics, particularly with the classical theory of electromagnetism. 
Surface integrals of scalar fields.
Consider a surface "S" on which a scalar field "f" is defined. If one thinks of "S" as made of some material, and for each x in "S" the number "f"(x) is the density of material at x, then the surface integral of "f" over "S" is the mass per unit thickness of "S". (This is only true if the surface is an infinitesimally thin shell.) 
One approach to calculating the surface integral is then to split the surface in many very small pieces, assume that the density is approximately constant on each piece, find the mass per unit thickness of each piece (by multiplying the density of the piece by its area), and then sum up the resulting numbers to find the total mass per unit thickness of "S".
To find an explicit formula for the surface integral, mathematicians parametrize "S" by considering on "S" a system of curvilinear coordinates, like the latitude and longitude on a sphere. Let such a parametrization be x("s", "t"), where ("s", "t") varies in some region "T" in the plane. Then, the surface integral is given by
where the expression between bars on the right-hand side is the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives of x("s", "t").
For example, to find the surface area of some general functional shape, say formula_2, we have
where formula_4. So that formula_5, and formula_6. So, 
which is the formula used for the surface area of a general functional shape. One can recognize the vector in the second line above as the normal vector to the surface.
Note that because of the presence of the cross product, the above formulas only work for surfaces embedded in three dimensional space.
Surface integrals of vector fields.
Consider a vector field v on "S", that is, for each x in "S", v(x) is a vector.
The surface integral can be defined component-wise according to the definition of the surface integral of a scalar field; the result is a vector. For example, this applies to the electric field at some fixed point due to an electrically charged surface, or the gravity at some fixed point due to a sheet of material. It can also calculate the magnetic flux through a surface.
Alternatively, mathematicians can integrate the normal component of the vector field; the result is a scalar. An example is a fluid flowing through "S", such that v(x) determines the velocity of the fluid at x. The flux is defined as the quantity of fluid flowing through "S" in a unit amount of time. 
This illustration implies that if the vector field is tangent to "S" at each point, then the flux is zero, because the fluid just flows in parallel to "S", and neither in nor out. This also implies that if v does not just flow along "S", that is, if v has both a tangential and a normal component, then only the normal component contributes to the flux. Based on this reasoning, to find the flux, we need to take the dot product of v with the unit surface normal to "S" at each point, which will give us a scalar field, and integrate the obtained field as above. This gives the formula
The cross product on the right-hand side of this expression is a surface normal determined by the parametrization.
This formula "defines" the integral on the left (note the dot and the vector notation for the surface element).
Theorems involving surface integrals.
Various useful results for surface integrals can be derived using differential geometry and vector calculus, such as the divergence theorem, and its generalization, Stokes' theorem.
Advanced issues.
Changing parametrization.
The discussion above defined the surface integral by using a parametrization of the surface "S". A given surface might have several parametrizations. For example, when the locations of the North Pole and South Pole are moved on a sphere, the latitude and longitude change for all the points on the sphere. A natural question is then whether the definition of the surface integral depends on the chosen parametrization. For integrals of scalar fields, the answer to this question is simple: the value of the surface integral will be the same no matter what parametrization one uses.
Integrals of vector fields are more complicated, because the surface normal is involved. Mathematicians have proved that given two parametrizations of the same surface, whose surface normals point in the same direction, both parametrizations give the same value for the surface integral. If, however, the normals for these parametrizations point in opposite directions, the value of the surface integral obtained using one parametrization is the negative of the one obtained via the other parametrization. It follows that given a surface, we do not need to stick to any unique parametrization; but, when integrating vector fields, we do need to decide in advance which direction the normal will point to, and then choose any parametrization consistent with that direction.
Parameterizations work on parts of the surface.
Sometimes surfaces do not have parametrizations which cover the whole surface; this is true for example for the surface of a cylinder (of finite height). The obvious solution is then to split that surface in several pieces, calculate the surface integral on each piece, and then add them all up. This is indeed how things work, but when integrating vector fields, one needs to again be careful in choosing the normal-pointing vector for each piece of the surface, so that when the pieces are put back together, the results are consistent. For the cylinder, this means that if we decide that for the side region the normal will point out of the body, then for the top and bottom circular parts, the normal must point out of the body too.
Inconsistent surface normals.
There are surfaces which do not have a surface normal at each point with consistent results (for example, the Möbius strip). If such a surface is split into pieces, on each piece a parametrization and corresponding surface normal is chosen, and the pieces are put back together, the normal vectors coming from different pieces cannot be reconciled. This means that at some junction between two pieces will have normal vectors pointing in opposite directions. Such a surface is called non-orientable. Vector fields cannot be integrated on non-orientable surfaces.

Narrandera ( ) is a town in southern New South Wales, Australia. It is near the junction of the Newell and Sturt Highways, on the banks of the Murrumbidgee River. In 2006 there were 3,961 people living in Narrandera.
History.
Narrandera is a river town with a long history. Captain Charles Sturt, the famous explorer, was the first European to see the area that later became known as Narrandera. However Sturt, who passed through on 12 December 1829, was not the first explorer to see the Murrumbidgee River. The upper Murrumbidgee, the "Big Water", was first discovered in April 1821, by Charles Throsby. The name "Narrandera" probably comes from Wiradjuri word "nharrang", meaning "frill-necked lizard".
The Narrungderra were the local indigenous people. They were all but destroyed by settlement, disease brought by European settlers, and clashes with the settlers. The last major battle between the indigenous people and European settlers took place near Massacre Island, and is said to have left only one survivor.
Narrandera is first recorded as a pastoral station or "run" (Narrandera Run) in 1848. The property was owned by Mr Edward Flood covered about .
The township developed in the early 1860s. Gillinbah Post Office opened nearby on 1 March 1859 and was replaced by the Narrandera office in 1861. A Gillenbah office was open from 1881 to 1892 and from 1906 to 1941.
The Borough of Narrandera began on 17 March 1885. The centenary of Local Government in Narrandera was celebrated in 1985.
Narrandera today.
The town of Narrandera is at the centre of a productive farming region. Its attractive tree-lined streets contrast with the open plains that surround it.
The Narrandera Memorial Gardens include the unusual Hankinson Fountain. Manufactured by the Royal Doulton Company of England, the ceramic fountain is one of only two known in the world, the other in India. It was given to the people of Narrandera by Alderman and Mrs Hankinson in 1922 in honour of locals who served in World War I. The Hankinson Fountain was smashed by an act of vandalism in 1971 and was restored by Charles Pearce.
To the east of Narrandera farmers grow cereal crops, sheep and wool. To the west, is the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) fed by water from the Burrinjuck Dam. The MIA is a region where farmer grow rice and other cereals with irrigation, as well as citrus, wine grapes and potatoes.
The town also has number of historic attractions, such as a fig tree on the corner of King and Cadell Streets, which is thought to be 150 years old; and the Mon Repos, a residence built in a Queen Anne-style, which was built in the 1890s.
Narrandera's Irrigation Canal which carries water to the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area flows through the town. It begins west at Berembed Weir where water is taken from the Murrumbidgee River. The canal follows the natural bed of Bundidgerry Creek and in places is very wide and has no levee banks. Lake Talbot was formed in 1924 when the bank of the Irrigation Canal gave way, flooding the river flat between the canal and Bundidgerry Hill. The shallow lake was allowed to remain and became an important recreational feature of the town. The eastern end of the lake is used by water skiiers. The western end is a wetland habitat for native fauna. A wetland has been made near Lizard Drive, only from the Murrumbidgee River. The Narrandera Wetland is a collection point for storm water run-off from the town.
Transport.
Narrandera is well served for transport. The Sturt Highway and the Newell Highways cross just south of Narrandera. Interstate buses pass daily - note that the destination can be listed as Jillenbah.
The Narranderra-Leeton airport is 5 km west of town. Regional Express (REX) operate several turboprop return services daily to Sydney, an hour and 10 minutes (approx) flying time away.
Narrandera's railway station is serviced by the weekly Sydney to Griffith XPlorer. It stops on the way to Griffith at 2:33pm on Saturdays and stops on the way back to Sydney at 8:45am on Sundays. CountryLink buses carry passengers daily to and from Wagga, to meet Sydney and Melbourne bound train services.
In popular culture.
The book Jessica by Bryce Courtenay has Narrandera as the main town near the place where the book is set.
Notable citizens.
Notable citizens from Narrandera include:

Imagine an electric field E passing through a surface. Consider an infinitesimal area (dA) on that surface across which E remains constant. Also assume that the angle between E and dA is i. The electric flux is defined as EdAcos(i). E and dA are vectors. Flux is the dot product of E and dA. Using full vector notation, the electric flux formula_1 through a small area formula_2 is given by
The electric flux over a surface "S" is therefore given by the surface integral:
where E is the electric field and dA is a differential area on the surface formula_5 with an outward facing surface normal defining its direction. 
For a closed Gaussian surface, electric flux is given by:
where QS is the net charge enclosed by the surface (including both free and bound charge), and �0 is the electric constant. This relation is known as Gauss' law for electric field in its integral form and it is one of the four Maxwell's equations.
Electric flux is not affected by charges that are not within the closed surface. But the net electric field, E, in the Gauss' Law equation, can be affected by charges that lie outside the closed surface. Gauss' Law is true in all situations, but people can only use it to calculate when high degrees of symmetry exist in the electric field. Examples include spherical and cylindrical symmetry. Otherwise, the calculations are too hard to do by hand and must be worked out using a computer.
Electrical flux has SI units of volt metres (V m), or, equivalently, newton metres squared per coulomb . So, the SI base units of electric flux are kg•m3•s−3•A−1.

The Sportclub Hakoah Graz ( - strength) was a Jewish sports and football club from the Styrian capital Graz. After Sturm and GAK it was the third top league team from Graz.
History.
The club was founded on 12 March 1919 to offer the Jewish people of Graz (around 4000) the possibility to do sports. The old club Jüdischen Turnvereins zu Graz was dissolved in 1917. Jewish officials were against the club. The club was highly accepted by the young football players.
In 1921, the football section took part in the 2.Klasse of the Styrian football championship. The first classes of the federal states were the highest, because at that time there was no Austrian-wide championship. The champion of Viennas highest league were considered Austrian champion. They played in blue and white jerseys with the Star of David on the breast. It was difficult for them to play because they had no ground of their own. Due to the antisemitism of that time other clubs often did not allow them to use their grounds. In 1923, they leased their own ground.
In the 1921/22 season, they reached the first place and were promoted to the 1. Klasse. In the 1. Klasse, the club was again confronted with antisemitism. The Deutscher Sportverein Leoben and Turnverein Leibniz did not want to play against a Jewish club. They were disqualified. During the years in the first class Hakoah often reached places on top of the table.
In 1935, the club was relegated to the 2. Klasse. The reason for this was that some players went to other clubs and some ended their career because antisemitism grew at that time. The club also lost its ground which was only leased. The contract was not prolonged. In the Second Class, they gained again strength but the occupation of Austria by Nazi Germany ended its history. The club was dissolved like all other Jewish sports clubs in Austria.

Gastroliths, or gizzard stones, are small rocks kept by an animal inside its stomach or at an early part of the alimentary canal. The function of these is to mash up the food so digestion takes place faster. Typically, animals which do this do not have suitable teeth for grinding, and the gastroliths are a good substitute for this. 
A second function, in aquatic animals, is that gastroliths can be used for ballast to make diving easier.
Identification.
Several pieces of evidence are needed to show that a rock was used by a fossil animal to aid its digestion. First, the stone must be unlike the rock found in its geological vicinity. Secondly, it should be rounded and polished, because inside a gizzard any genuine gastrolith would grind against other stones and fibrous materials, like the action of a rock tumbler. Lastly, the stone must be found with the fossils of the animal which ingested it.
Occurrence.
Among living vertebrates, gastroliths are common among crocodiles, alligators, herbivorous birds, seals and sea lions. Domestic fowl need access to "grit". Stones swallowed by ostriches can exceed a length of . Amphibians such as the Axolotl ingest rocks that are presumed to be gastroliths. Apparent microgastroliths have also been found in frog tadpoles. Ingestion of silt and gravel by tadpoles of various frog species improves buoyancy control.
Sauropod dinosaurs appear to have used stones to grind tough plant matter. An example of this is the early Cretaceous theropod "Caudipteryx zoui" from northeastern China. It was discovered with a series of small stones, in the area of its skeleton that would have corresponded with its abdominal region. Aquatic animals, such as plesiosaurs, may have used them as ballast, to help balance themselves or to decrease their buoyancy, as crocodiles do. Some fossil gastroliths are rounded and polished, many stones in living birds are not polished at all. Gastroliths associated with dinosaur fossils can weigh several kilograms.

French grammar is the rules about how to speak and write the French language. It is similar to the grammar of other Romance languages. 
French is moderately inflected. This means that some words change their form in different situations.
Verb.
In French, verbs are conjugated to show information. That means they change endings.
Person.
Verbs are conjugated to match with grammatical person.
Irregular Verbs.
Most French verbs are regular, which means that the someone can guess how to conjugate a verb based on what letters a verb ends with. However, some verbs are irregular. Irregular verbs do not follow the normal pattern of conjugation. Instead, the forms must be learned differently. An example of an irregular verb in French is "être" (to be).
Noun.
Gender.
Every French noun has a gender. A noun can be either masculine or feminine.
Number.
The plural of a noun usually ends with -"s". For example, dog ("chien") becomes dogs ("chiens"). However, if a noun ends in -"au", -"eu", or -"ou", it can have -"x" at the end as a plural. For example, game ("jeu") becomes games ("jeux"). If a noun already ends with -"s", -"x", or -"z", it does not change in the plural.
Adjectives.
In French, adjectives change in order to agree with the gender and number of the noun it describes.
Word order.
The word order in French is subject-verb-object. In the sentence "Je mange le gâteau" (I eat the cake), "je" (I) is the subject and "le gâteau" (the cake) is the object. However, if the object is a pronoun, it goes before the verb. If "le gâteau" is replaced by "le" (it), the sentence becomes "Je le mange" (I eat it).

Qinhuangdao (���) is a city in the north of China. It is in Hebei Province.
It is about east of Beijing, on the Bohai Sea. The city had 2,987,605 people as of 2010. Qinhuangdao is one of fourteen coastal open cities, which are important foreign trade ports in north China. It was approved as a national grade tourist city by the State Council. Famous scenic spots include Shanhaiguan and Beidaihe. Qinhuangdao City is a state-level economic and technological development zone of Qinhuangdao.
The name in Chinese means "island of the Qin Emperor" or "Emperor Qin's island", since it was where Emperor Qin Shi Huang sent men to search for immortals, or living beings who cannot die or grow old, across the sea.
Geography.
Qinhuangdao City, Hebei Province, is in the northeast of China , north latitude 39 ° 24 '~ 40 ° 37', longitude 118 ° 33 '~ 119 ° 51'.  Qinhuangdao's climate is a humid, temperate, monsoon climate, influenced by the ocean.
Transportation.
Qinhuangdao's train station serves the Beijing-Harbin Railway, Daqin Railway and Tsuyama railway. China's first express passenger line between Qinhuangdao and Shenyang Passenger starts here. The line became the official carrier on October 12, 2013.
Qinhuangdao Shanhaiguan Airport has flights from Shijiazhuang, Wuhan and Shanghai.
Qinhuangdao's Port is one of China's bigger energy output ports. It is one of the major ports where China's Shanxi Coal can go to other countries. It is a natural, ice-free harbor.
Industry.
The very important industries are glass, ship making, Metallurgy (making gold), and auto parts.
Education.
Yanshan University and the Hebei Institute of International Business and Economics (HIIBE) is in Qinhuangdao.

Yanshan University is a university in Qinhuangdao, Hebei, China.

In particle physics, a beamline is the path in a particle accelerator of the particles.
In materials science, physics, chemistry, and molecular biology, a beamline leads to the experimental endstation utilizing particle beams from a particle accelerator, synchrotron light obtained from a synchrotron, or neutrons from a spallation source or research reactor.
Beamline in a particle accelerator.
In particle accelerators, the beamline is usually housed in a tunnel and/or underground, cased inside a cement housing. The beamline is usually cylindrical metal. Typical names include, "beam pipe", and/or a blank section called a "drift tube". This entire section must be under a good vacuum in order to have the beam travel for a long distance.
A survey and alignment crew carefully align the beamline segments by using a laser tracker. All beamlines must be within micrometre tolerance. Good alignment helps to prevent beam loss, and beam from colliding with the pipe walls, which creates secondary emissions and/or radiation.
Synchrotron radiation beamline.
Regarding synchrotrons, a beamline is the instrumentation that carries beams of synchrotron radiation to an experimental end station, which uses the radiation produced by the bending magnets and insertion devices in the storage ring of a synchrotron light source. A typical application for this kind of beamline is crystallography. Scientists also use synchrotron light in many other ways.
A large synchrotron laboratory will have many beamlines, each optimized for a particular field of research. The differences will depend on the type of insertion device (which, in turn, determines the intensity and spectral distribution of the radiation); the beam conditioning equipment; and the experimental end station.
A typical beamline at a modern synchrotron will be 25 to 100 m (82 ft to 328 ft) long from the storage ring to the end station, and may cost up to millions of US dollars. For this reason, a synchrotron facility is often built in stages, with the first few beamlines at the start of operation, and other beamlines being added later as the funding permits.
The beamline elements are in radiation shielding enclosures, called hutches, which are the size of a small room (cabin). A typical beamline consists of two hutches, an optical hutch for the beam conditioning elements and an experimental hutch, which houses the experiment. Between hutches, the beam travels in a transport tube. People are not allowed to enter hutches when the beam shutter is open and radiation can enter the hutch. Hutches have complex safety systems with redundant interlocking functions to make sure that no one is inside the hutch when the radiation is turned on. The safety system will also shut down the radiation beam if the door to the hutch is accidentally opened when the beam is on. In this case, the beam is turned off by dumping the electron beam circulating in the synchrotron. So, opening one door will shut down all of the beamlines in the facility.
Experimenters use the following elements that are used in beamlines for conditioning the radiation beam between the storage ring and the end station:
The combination of beam conditioning devices controls the thermal load (heating caused by the beam) at the end station; the spectrum of radiation incident at the end station; and the focus or collimation of the beam. Devices along the beamline which absorb significant power from the beam may need to be actively cooled by water, or liquid nitrogen. The entire length of a beamline is normally kept under ultra high vacuum conditions.
Neutron beamline.
An experimental end station in a neutron facility is called a neutron beamline. Superficially, neutron beamlines differ from synchrotron radiation beamlines mostly by the fact that they use neutrons from a research reactor or a spallation source instead of photons. The experiments usually measure neutron scattering from the sample under study.

Fred Burton (born January 2, 1958) is STATFOR's vice president for intelligence. STRATFOR is a global intelligence company. Burton is thought to be "one of the world's foremost experts on security, terrorists and terrorist organizations." This basically means that he is thought to be one of the world's best intelligence workers.
He was a special agent with the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service.
Washington asked Burton to help the investigation of the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. He used to be the deputy chief of the counter-terrorism part of the U.S. State Department's Diplomatic Security Service. He also investigated the killing of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the al Qaeda New York City bombing plots before the September 11 attacks and the Libyan-backed terrorist attacks against diplomats in Sana'a and Khartoum. He helped in the arrest of Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993.
Burton is the author of a memoir called "Ghost: Confessions of a Counterterrorism Agent". It was published by Random House in 2008. Another memoir is "Chasing Shadows: A Special Agent's Lifelong Hunt to Bring a Cold War Assassin to Justice", published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2011.
Burton was moved to the Texas Border Security Council on September 11, 2007 by Governor Rick Perry.
In August 2009 he was hired as the Texas Department of Public Safety's Assistant Director for Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism but left after 2 months. This was because he wanted to work on his writing and speaking career.

Hispanic (Spanish: "Hispano", "hispánico") is a word that originally meant a relationship to Hispania. This is the Iberian Peninsula and includes Portugal, Andorra, Gibraltar and Spain. Now the word is used with a more limited meaning. 
In the United States, Hispanic and Latino are different ethnic categories. Hispanic simply means a person who comes from a country where Spanish is the official language, this includes Puerto Rico of the United States whereas Latino means a person who comes from a country in Latin America (which includes only Mexico of North America, the Caribbean, Central America, and South America). 
Spanish names, the Spanish language, and Spanish customs can also be found in other areas that were part of the Spanish and Portuguese Empires, such as in Equatorial Guinea in Africa, or in the Spanish East Indies (e.g. Philipines) and the Portuguese Brazil.

The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (LLFPA) is an Act of Congress about pay discrimination that was signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 29, 2009.
The bill amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 stating that the 180-day statute of limitations for filing an equal-pay lawsuit regarding pay discrimination resets with each new discriminatory paycheck. The law was a direct answer to the "Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.", , a U.S. Supreme Court decision holding that the statute of limitations for presenting an equal-pay lawsuit begins on the date that the employer makes the initial discriminatory wage decision, not at the date of the most recent paycheck, as a lower court had ruled.
A first bill to amend the statutory limitations period and supersede the "Ledbetter" decision was introduced in the 110th United States Congress but was never enacted, as after having been passed by the House it failed to survive a cloture vote in the Senate due to the opposition of most of the Republican Senators. 
During the campaign for the 2008 elections, the Democrats criticized Republicans for defeating the 2007 version of the bill, citing Republican presidential candidate John McCain's opposition. Then-candidate Barack Obama supported the bill.
After the 2008 election gave the Democratic Party control of both the House and Senate, a new version of the bill was introduced in the first session of the 111th United States Congress and quickly passed both bodies. It became the law signed by the new President Obama after he took office on January 20.
Court rulings.
Lilly Ledbetter, a production supervisor at a Goodyear tire plant in Alabama, filed an equal-pay lawsuit seeking back pay for pay discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. She worked for that company for many years without learning that she was paid much less than the men holding the same job. She filed the lawsuit six months before her early retirement in 1998. The District court said her lawsuit was filed on time, but the Court of Appeals said her lawsuit was too late. Ledbetter appealed the decision to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 by a 5-4 majority vote that Ledbetter's complaint was filed too late because the discriminatory decisions relating to pay had been made more than 180 days prior to the date she filed her charge, as explained by Justice Samuel Alito. The minority position explained by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg proposed an interpretation according to which the law runs from the date of any paycheck that contains an amount affected by a prior discriminatory pay decision.
The "Ledbetter" decision was cited by federal judges in 300 cases before the LLFPA was passed. These cases involved not only Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, but also the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Fair Housing Act, Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act and Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.
The case had never received much attention before going to the Supreme Court, but the Court's ruling ignited legal groups on the left and Democrats that took action to transform the "Ledbetter" case into a rallying issue for the left. Some activists saw Lilly Ledbetter as an ideal standard-bearer in their attempt to persuade the public that the Supreme Court was moving too far to the right. 
Among the first to criticize the Court's decision was Marcia Greenberger, president of the National Women's Law Center, that saw in the ruling a "setback for women and a setback for civil rights" and called Ginsburg's opinion a "clarion call to the American people that this slim majority of the court is headed in the wrong direction." Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women &amp; Families, also condemned the decision, saying, “If employers can keep the discrimination hidden for a period of time, they can continue to discriminate without being held accountable.” On the other side, the majority's findings were applauded by the US Chamber of Commerce, that called it a "fair decision" that "eliminates a potential wind-fall against employers by employees trying to dredge up stale pay claims."
The Bill.
The House Democrats were fast to react. On June 12, the caucus spoke against the Supreme Court decision. Claiming lead from Justice Ruth Ginsburg's minority opinion, which invited the Congress to take action by amending the law, the Democrats announced their intention to intervene: House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller said that a bill was to be passed to avoid future court rulings in line with "Ledbetter", clearly putting that "a key provision of the legislation will make it clear that discrimination occurs not just when the decision to discriminate is made, but also when someone becomes subject to that discriminatory decision, and when they are affected by that discriminatory decision, including each time they are issued a discriminatory paycheck", as said by Rep. Miller.
Republicans immediately opposed the bill as drafted, with Education and Labor Committee ranking member Howard McKeon raising the issue that companies would be held liable for actions taken by managers who were not leading the company anymore: "At the end of the day, such a loophole conceivably could allow a retiring employee to seek damages against a company now led by executives who had nothing to do with the initial act of discrimination".
The issue divided lawyers. The American Bar Association passed a resolution supporting the new bill. Other lawyers, such as Neal Mollen, argued that extending the term limit would put a strain on the chances of an adequate defense for the employers, as to defend themselves one "has to rely on documents and the memory of individuals, and neither of those is permanent. If a disappointed employee can wait for many years before raising a claim of discrimination ... he or she can wait out the employer, that is ensure that the employer effectively unable to offer any meaningful defense to the claim".
Organizations that supported the bill included the: American Civil Liberties Union, AFL-CIO, American Federation of Teachers, National Education Association, American Rights at Work, American Library Association, People For the American Way, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, National Employment Lawyers Association, Hadassah, National Women's Law Center, National Network to End Domestic Violence, Center for Inquiry - Washington DC
American Association of University Women, Alliance for Justice, Legal Momentum, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, National Partnership for Women and Families, Coalition of Labor Union Women, Moms Rising, National Organization for Women, American Association of Retired Persons, Women's Voices, Women Vote Action Fund, 21st Century Democrats, 9to5, National Association of Working Women, the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, and Women Employed.
Organizations that opposed the bill include the: U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Eagle Forum, Society for Human Resource Management, National Association of Manufacturers, American Bakers Association, College and University Professional Association for Human Resources, Associated Builders and Contractors, and American Housing &amp; Lodging Association.
Legislative history.
The bill ( and ) was defeated in April 2008 by Republicans in the Senate who cited the possibility of frivolous lawsuits in their opposition of the bill and criticized Democrats for refusing to allow compromises.
The bill was re-introduced in the 111th Congress (as and ) in January 2009. It passed in the House of Representatives with 247 votes in support and 171 against. The vote was nearly perfectly split along party lines, with only three Republicans voting in favor (Ed Whitfield of Kentucky, Don Young of Alaska and Chris Smith of New Jersey) and three Democrats voting nay (Travis Childers of Mississippi, Allen Boyd of Florida, and Parker Griffith of Alabama).
The Senate voted 72 to 23 to invoke cloture on S. 181 on January 15, 2009. (The vote to invoke cloture ends debate on a bill, and usually leads to a final vote within a few days.) The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act passed the Senate, 61-36, on January 22, 2009. The votes in favor included every Democratic senator (except Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, who was absent from the vote because of health issues) and five Republican senators. 
As president, Obama actively supported the bill. The official White House blog said:
President Obama has long championed this bill and Lilly Ledbetter's cause, and by signing it into law, he will ensure that women like Ms. Ledbetter and other victims of pay discrimination can effectively challenge unequal pay.
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced that the House would vote on S.181 (the bill passed by the Senate) during the week of January 26, getting the bill to President Obama's desk sooner rather than later. On January 27, the House passed S.181 by a 250-177 margin. 
On January 29, Obama signed the bill into law. It was the first act he signed as president, and it fulfilled his campaign pledge to nullify "Ledbetter v. Goodyear". However, some newspapers criticised him for signing it only two days after it was passed by the House. The "St. Petersburg Times" which mentioned his campaign promise to give the public five days of notice to comment on legislation before he signed bills. The White House through a spokesman answered that they would be "implementing this policy in full soon", and that currently they were "working through implementation procedures and some initial issues with the congressional calendar".

Event Centre rock (also known as arena rock, corporate rock, industry rock,or stadium rock) is a word to describe a form of rock music which is played, or intended to be played, in large venues, such as event centres, arenas, stadia, and open-air concert spaces. In such a way, genres which traditionally fall within the categories of event centre rock tend to be (yet not always) loud and anthemic; event centre rock is most traditionally associated with heavy metal, progressive rock, hard rock, glam metal or pop rock genres. Often, yet not always, event centre rock is categorised as being more mass-scale, commercially appealing, and radio-oriented music. Due to the often commercial nature of event centre rock, it is occasionally called corporate rock.
Event centre rock is generally associated with the grand shows that artists and groups within the style would hold. At these performances, large sound systems, and often elaborate lighting, additional effects and fireworks, would be included. The 1970s and 80s were a major period in event centre rock.
Whilst event centre rock has seen large popularity over the years, especially from the 1960s to the 1980s, it has also been criticised for its often commercial and extravagant nature, especially with regards to the shows and concert tours that event centre rock bands and artists would have. To some extent, genres such as pub rock, punk rock, indie rock and alternative rock grew as a reaction against the nature and aesthetic of event centre rock, opting for a less commercial and over-the-top style.
Famous bands associated with event centre rock include Kiss, Queen, Aerosmith, Journey, and Styx, amongst several others.

On 25 December, 2011, there were a number of attacks on Christmas Day during church services in northern Nigeria. There were bombings and shootings at churches in Madalla (near the capital, Abuja), Jos, Gadaka and Damaturu. At least 39 people were killed. The attacks were claimed by the Islamist group Boko Haram.

Magnetic reluctance, or magnetic resistance, is a measurement used in the analysis of magnetic circuits. It is like resistance in an electrical circuit, but rather than dissipating magnetic energy it stores magnetic energy. As an electric field causes an electric current to follow the path of least resistance, a magnetic field causes magnetic flux to follow the path of least magnetic reluctance. It is a scalar, 
extensive quantity, like electrical resistance.
Reluctance is usually represented by R.
History.
The term was coined in May 1888 by Oliver Heaviside. The notion of “magnetic resistance” was first mentioned by James Joule and the term "magnetomotive force” (MMF) was first named by Bosanquet. The idea for a magnetic flux law, similar to Ohm's law for closed electric circuits, is attributed to H. Rowland.
Definition.
The total reluctance is equal to the ratio of the "magnetomotive force” (MMF) in a passive magnetic circuit to the magnetic flux in this circuit. In an AC field, the reluctance is the ratio of the amplitude values for a sinusoidal MMF and magnetic flux. (see phasors)
The definition can be expressed as:
where
It is sometimes known as Hopkinson's law and is analogous to Ohm's Law with resistance replaced by reluctance, voltage by MMF and current by magnetic flux.
Magnetic flux always forms a closed loop, as described by Maxwell's equations, but the path of the loop depends on the reluctance of the surrounding materials. It is concentrated around the path of least reluctance. Air and vacuum have high reluctance. Easily magnetized materials such as soft iron have low reluctance. The concentration of flux in low-reluctance materials forms strong temporary poles and causes mechanical forces that tend to move the materials towards regions of higher flux so it is always an attractive force (pull).
The reluctance of a uniform magnetic circuit can be calculated as:
or
where
The inverse of reluctance is called "permeance".
Its SI derived unit is the henry (the same as the unit of inductance, although the two concepts are distinct).
Applications.
Reluctance can also be applied to:

Ampère's circuital law, discovered by André-Marie Ampère in 1826, relates the magnetic field around a closed loop to the electric current passing through the loop. It is now one of Maxwell's equations, which form the basis of classical electromagnetism.
Original Ampère's circuital law.
The law relates magnetic fields to electric currents that produce them. A scientist can use Ampere's law to determine the magnetic field associated with a given current or current associated with a given magnetic field, if there is no time changing electric field present.
In its original form, Ampère's Circuital Law relates the magnetic field to its electric current source. 
The law can be written in two forms, the "integral form" and the "differential form". The forms are equivalent, and related by the Kelvin–Stokes theorem. It can also be written in terms of either the B or H magnetic fields. Again, the two forms are equivalent (see the "proof" section below).
Ampère's circuital law is now known to be a correct law of physics in a magnetostatic situation: The system is static except possibly for continuous steady currents within closed loops. In all other cases the law is incorrect unless Maxwell's correction is included (see below).
Integral form.
In SI units (the version in cgs units is in a later section), the "integral form" of the original Ampère's circuital law is:
or equivalently,
where
See below for further explanation of the curve "C" and surface "S". There are a number of ambiguities in the above definitions that require clarification and a choice of convention.
First, three of these terms are associated with sign ambiguities: the line integral formula_5 could go around the loop in either direction (clockwise or counterclockwise); the vector area dS could point in either of the two directions normal to the surface; and "I"enc is the net current passing through the surface "S", meaning the current passing through in one direction, minus the current in the other direction—but either direction could be chosen as positive. These ambiguities are resolved by the right-hand rule: With the palm of the right-hand toward the area of integration, and the index-finger pointing along the direction of line-integration, the outstretched thumb points in the direction that must be chosen for the vector area dS. Also the current passing in the same direction as dS must be counted as positive. The right hand grip rule can also be used to determine the signs.
Second, there are infinitely many possible surfaces "S" that have the curve "C" as their border. (Imagine a soap film on a wire loop, which can be deformed by moving the wire). Which of those surfaces is to be chosen? If the loop does not lie in a single plane, for example, there is no one obvious choice. The answer is that it does not matter; it can be proven that any surface with boundary "C" can be chosen.
Differential form.
By the Kelvin–Stokes theorem, this equation can also be written in a "differential form". Again, this equation only applies in the case where the electric field is constant in time; see below for the more general form. In SI units, the equation states:
where
Note on free current versus bound current.
The electric current that arises in the simplest textbook situations would be classified as "free current." For example, the law can apply to the current that passes through a wire or battery. In contrast, "bound current" arises in the context of bulk materials that can be magnetized and/or polarized. (All materials can to some extent.) 
When a material is magnetized (for example, by placing it in an external magnetic field), the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms, but behave as if they were orbiting the nucleus in a particular direction, creating a microscopic current. When the currents from all these atoms are put together, they create the same effect as a macroscopic current, circulating perpetually around the magnetized object. This magnetization current JM is one contribution to "bound current". 
The other source of bound current is bound charge. When an electric field is applied, the positive and negative bound charges can separate over atomic distances in polarizable materials, and when the bound charges move, the polarization changes, creating another contribution to the "bound current", the polarization current JP.
The total current density J due to free and bound charges is then:
with Jf the "free" or "conduction" current density.
All current is fundamentally the same, microscopically. There are often practical reasons for wanting to treat bound current differently from free current. For example, the bound current usually originates over atomic dimensions, and one may wish to take advantage of a simpler theory intended for larger dimensions. The result is that the more microscopic Ampère's law, expressed in terms of B and the microscopic current (which includes free, magnetization and polarization currents), is sometimes put into the equivalent form below in terms of H and the free current only. For a detailed definition of free current and bound current, and the proof that the two formulations are equivalent, see the "proof" section below.
Shortcomings of the original formulation of Ampère's circuital law.
Two issues regarding Ampère's law are important. First, there is an issue regarding the continuity equation for electrical charge. There is a theorem in vector calculus that states the divergence of a curl must always be zero. Hence 
and so the original Ampère's law implies that 
But in general 
which is non-zero for a time-varying charge density. An example occurs in a capacitor circuit where time-varying charge densities exist on the plates.
Second, there is an issue regarding the propagation of electromagnetic waves. For example, in free space, where 
Ampère's law implies that 
but instead 
To treat these situations, the contribution of displacement current must be added to the current term in Ampère's law. 
James Clerk Maxwell conceived of displacement current as a polarization current in the dielectric vortex sea, which he used to model the magnetic field with water (hydrodynamically) and with mechanical systems (mechanically). He added this displacement current to Ampère's circuital law at equation (112) in his 1861 paper "" .
Displacement current.
In free space, the displacement current is related to the time rate of change of electric field.
In a dielectric the above contribution to displacement current is also present, but a major contribution to the displacement current is related to the polarization of the individual molecules of the dielectric material. Even though charges cannot flow freely in a dielectric, the charges in molecules can move a little under the influence of an electric field. The positive and negative charges in molecules separate under the applied field, causing an increase in the state of polarization, expressed as the polarization density P. A changing state of polarization is equivalent to a current.
Both contributions to the displacement current are combined by defining the displacement current as:
where the electric displacement field is defined as:
where �0 is the electric constant, "�"r the relative static permittivity, and P is the polarization density. Substituting this form for D in the expression for displacement current, it has two components:
The first term on the right hand side is present everywhere, even in a vacuum. It doesn't involve any actual movement of charge, but it nevertheless has an associated magnetic field, as if it were an actual current. Some authors apply the name "displacement current" to only this contribution.
The second term on the right hand side is the displacement current as originally conceived by Maxwell, associated with the polarization of the individual molecules of the dielectric material. 
Maxwell's original explanation for displacement current focused upon the situation that occurs in dielectric media. In the modern post-aether era, the concept has been extended to apply to situations with no material media present, for example, to the vacuum between the plates of a charging vacuum capacitor. The displacement current is justified today because it serves several requirements of an electromagnetic theory: correct prediction of magnetic fields in regions where no free current flows; prediction of wave propagation of electromagnetic fields; and conservation of electric charge in cases where charge density is time-varying. For greater discussion see Displacement current.
Extending the original law: the Maxwell–Ampère equation.
Ampère's equation was extended by including the polarization current, thereby remedying the limited applicability of the original Ampère's circuital law.
Treating free charges separately from bound charges, Ampère's equation including Maxwell's correction in terms of the H-field is (the H-field is used because it includes the magnetization currents, so JM does not appear explicitly, see H-field and also Note):
(integral form), where H is the magnetic H field (also called "auxiliary magnetic field", "magnetic field intensity", or just "magnetic field", D is the electric displacement field, and Jf is the enclosed conduction current or free current density. In differential form,
On the other hand, treating all charges on the same footing (disregarding whether they are bound or free charges), the generalized Ampère's equation (also called the Maxwell–Ampère equation) is (see the "proof" section below):
in integral form. In differential form,
In both forms J includes magnetization current density as well as conduction and polarization current densities. That is, the current density on the right side of the Ampère–Maxwell equation is:
where current density JD is the "displacement current", and J is the current density contribution actually due to movement of charges, both free and bound. Because , the charge continuity issue with Ampère's original formulation is no longer a problem. Because of the term in "�0∂E / ∂t", wave propagation in free space now is possible.
With the addition of the displacement current, Maxwell was able to hypothesize (correctly) that light was a form of electromagnetic wave. See electromagnetic wave equation for a discussion of this important discovery.

The differential form of the equation (again, including Maxwell's correction) is

A climbing route is a trail that a mountain climber uses to go up a mountain.
It is often simply called a "climb".
Examples : on and on are climbing routes.
The difficulties and lengths of climbing routes (as well as descriptions and photographies) can be found in books called climbing guides. For instance, is a climbing guide that describes climbing routes of North America.

The summit is the top of a mountain or hill. In geography, the elevation of mountains is measured. The elevation is the difference in height between sea level and the top of a mountain or hill. A peak is a pointed mountain, though not always.

An enterotype is a classification of gut flora. It is based on the ecosystem in the human intestinal system. The classification is done by identifying the bacteria and protists which live there. This is called the "human gut biome". 
Research shows there are three distinct ecosystems in the guts of people. People can be classified into one of three groups based on the bacteria in their intestines. The enterotype of each person is set while the person is an infant. 
The enterotype affects how well a person can digest food or absorb drugs. Chimpanzees have enterotypes that look similar to human enterotypes.
Type 1 has high levels of "Bacteroides". "Prevotella" are common in Type 2. Type 3 has high levels of "Ruminococcus".

Terrazzo is a building material that has the cross-section of polished rock chips decorating its appearance.
It is a composite material made up of chips surrounded by a binder. It is poured in place or precast. It is used for floors or walls. It consists of marble, quartz, granite, glass or other suitable chips, sprinkled or unsprinkled, and poured with a binder that is cement-like, chemical or a combination of both. Terrazzo is cured, ground and polished to a smooth surface. Sometimes, it is finished to produce a uniformly textured surface that is not flat.
Production.
Terrazzo artisans create walkways, floors, patios, and panels by exposing marble chips and other fine aggregates on the surface of finished concrete or epoxy-resin. Much of the preliminary work of terrazzo workers is similar to that of cement masons. Marble-chip, cementitious terrazzo requires three layers of materials. First, cement masons or terrazzo workers build a solid, level concrete foundation that is 3 to 4 inches (7.6 cm to 10 cm) deep. After the forms are removed from the foundation, workers add a 1-inch (2.54 cm) layer of sandy concrete. Before this layer sets, terrazzo workers partially embed metal divider strips in the concrete wherever there is to be a joint or change of color in the terrazzo. For the final layer, terrazzo workers blend and place into each of the panels a fine marble chip mixture that may be color-pigmented. While the mixture is still wet, workers toss additional marble chips of various colors into each panel and roll a lightweight roller over the entire surface.
In the 1970s, polymer-based terrazzo was introduced and is called thin-set terrazzo. Initially polyester and vinyl ester resins were used as the binder resin. Today, most of the terrazzo installed is epoxy terrazzo. The advantages of this material over cement-based terrazzo include: a wider selection of colors, 1/4 inch to 3/8 inch (.63 cm to .95 cm) installation thickness, lighter weight, faster installation, impermeable finish, higher strength, and cracking less. The disadvantage of epoxy resin based terrazzo is that it can only be used inside, not outside buildings. Epoxy-based terrazzo will lose its color and slightly peel when used outdoors. Cement-based terrazzo will not.
In addition to marble aggregate blends, other aggregates have been used such as mother of pearl and abalone shell. Recycled aggregates include: glass, porcelain, concrete and metal. Shapes and medallions can be fabricated on site by bending divider strips or off site by water-jet cutting.
When the terrazzo is thoroughly dry (or cured in the case of thin-set terrazzo), helpers grind it with a terrazzo grinder, which is somewhat like a floor polisher, only much heavier. Slight depressions left by the grinding are filled with a matching grout material and hand-troweled for a smooth, uniform surface. Terrazzo contractors then clean, polish, and seal the dry surface for a finish that shines.
Historical.
Venetian construction workers invented terrazzo for use as a low cost flooring material using leftover marble chips from upscale jobs. The workers would usually set them in clay to surface the patios around their living quarters. Consisting originally of marble chips, clay, and goat milk (as the sealer), production of terrazzo became much easier after the 1920s and the introduction of electric industrial grinders and other power equipment.
Newly-set terrazzo will not look like marble unless it is wet. So, they used the goat's milk to act as a sealer and preserving the wet and marble-like look.
Archaeological.
Archaeologists use the word "terrazzo" to describe the floors of early neolithic buildings (PPN A and B, ca. 9,000–8,000 BC) in Western Asia, that are constructed of burnt lime and clay, colored red with ochre and polished. The embedded crushed limestone gives it a slightly mottled appearance.
The use of fire to produce burnt lime, which was also used for the hafting of implements, predates the use of pottery by almost a thousand years.
In the early Neolithic settlement of Cayönü in eastern Turkey ca. 90 m2 of terrazzo floors have been uncovered. The floors of the PPN B settlement of Nevali Cori measure about 80 m2. They are 15 cm thick, and contain about 10-15 % lime.
Other sites with terrazzo floors include Nevali Cori, Göbekli Tepe, Jericho, and Kastros (Cyprus).
Terrazzo and sustainability.
Terrazzo flooring is an original recycled product, created centuries ago by Venetian workers using the waste chips from slab marble processing. Today Terrazzo continues to provide environmentally friendly durability and low maintenance, typically lasting the life of the building. With no volatile organic compounds (VOC), it earns further point on indoor air quality ratings. Recycled content is still a standard feature of modern terrazzo. 
Terrazzo aggregates, binders and finished flooring systems can contribute to U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) credits, under the LEED-NC rating system, version 2.2. 
The evaluation of a construction product for its environmental impact considers the longevity of the material, the composition, recycled materials, maintenance requirements, embodied energy, and lifetime environmental impact. 
Durability is at the core of green construction. Terrazzo flooring can be refinished repeatedly, reusing instead of replacing materials. It can be restored to its original luster at a fraction of the cost of replacement. Even century-old floors have generally proven need little more than minor repairs and refinishing to return them to their original beauty.
Terrazzo flooring (both cement and thin-set epoxy) also requires only minimal, low-cost maintenance. Routine maintenance should be no more than dry and damp mopping, with an occasional spray buffing. Waxing or chemical cleaners only serve to cloud or damage the finish. Annual stripping and resealing can be done with water-based products. 
Terrazzo is composed of naturally occurring aggregates, recycled glass or plastic and processed cement or epoxy binders. The binders constitute 25-30 percent of the volume of a floor; the remainder is composed of aggregates, pigments and fillers. 
Post-consumer recycled glass or post-industrial stone from slab granite and marble processing increase the amount of recycled content in Terrazzo, along with recycled aluminum divider strips.
Both cement-based and thin-set epoxy Terrazzo systems are made of zero VOC materials. Terrazzo produces little or no off-gassing over the life of a cured floor. The non-porous Terrazzo finish resists microbial growth and moisture. 
The potential for local sourcing is another environmental strength of Terrazzo. Manufactured on site, Terrazzo installations generally produce minimal post-commercial waste and save on transportation costs. 
On typical projects, Terrazzo can realistically contribute to five LEED credits: MRcr4 (2), MRcr5 (2) EQcr4 (1). Terrazzo may also potentially contribute to MRcr1 (1), and in extreme cases, ldcr1 (1), for a total of eight points.

Maccabi Tel Aviv Football Club (; "Moadon Kaduregel Maccabi Tel Aviv") is an Israeli football club. It is one of the oldest clubs in Israeli football. The club is also the most successful. They have won 18 championships, 22 national cups, 2 Asian Champions Cups and 3 Toto cups. The homeground of the team is the Bloomfield Stadium in Tel Aviv, where also the city rival Hapoel Tel Aviv is playing.
History.
The club was founded in 1906. It was the first Jewish football club in Ottoman Palestine. The name was then Rishon Lezion-Yafo. The first match was a 3-0 win against a team of French sailors. After the foundation of Tel Aviv in 1909 the clubs name was changed into Maccabi Tel Aviv. Maccabi was founding member of the Palestine Football Association and the Palestine League.
In 1936 the club was invited to play in the United States. On the way Maccabi played in France versus Racing Paris and Olympique Lille. In the United States they played against an All-star team of New York City at Yankee Stadium. Maccabi also defeated the American Soccer League team in Brooklyn and Philadelphia on their home ground 1–0. Other matches were against St. Louis Stars and the Boston Celtics. They played also in Canada, where they drew 1–1 with Toronto All-Stars. In 1939 they played 18 matches in Australia.
After the independence in 1948 Tel Aviv was the most successful club in Israel's top league. 
The 1950s decade is considered to be their "golden age" because they won 5 league championships and 4 cups. The club was almost relegated in 1976 but beat Beitar Jerusalem in the relegation play-off.
In the 2011/12 season they reached the group stage of the UEFA Europa League. The team played versus PSV Eindhoven, Rapid Bucharest and Legia Warsaw. They failed to reach the next stage (2 wins, 1 draw, 3 lost).
Current team.

In an Israel team only 5 foreigners are allowed. The foreigners are:

 was a Japanese supercentenarian and at the time of her death the oldest living Japanese person for over one and a half year after Kame Chinen's death on 2 May 2010, and the second-oldest living person in the world behind American woman Besse Cooper.
Cooper and Hasegawa were, after the death of Italianwoman Venere Pizzinato who was just three days younger than Hasegawa and died 4 months before Hasegawa, the last two living people born in 1896.
Hasegawa was visited by Governor Furukawa of Saga Prefecture at her nursing home on Senior Citizen's Day in September 2008.
Hasegawa died of natural causes at 8.28am on 2 December 2011, just 12 days after celebrating her 115th birthday, and was succeeded as the oldest living Japanese person by Jiroemon Kimura, and as the oldest living Japanese woman by Koto Okubo. Hasegawa, Kimura and Okubo were the first three Japanese persons who became 115 years old after 116-year-old Tane Ikai's death in July 1995.

Shantungosaurus was a huge hadrosaur found in the Upper Cretaceous Wangshi Formation of the Shandong Peninsula in China. It was the largest known hadrosaur.
The skeleton of a medium-sized individual mounted at the Geological Institute of China in Beijing is in length, and the type skull is long. The weight of this genus is estimated at up to . With a composite mounted skeleton 17 meters long (55.7 ft) it is the largest known ornithischian and the largest non-sauropod dinosaur. 
It had an unusually long tail, presumably to counterbalance the great weight of the body at the animal's hips.
Like all hadrosaurs its beak was toothless, but its jaws were packed with around 1,500 tiny chewing teeth. A large hole near its nostrils may have been covered by a loose flap, which could be inflated to make sounds.
First described in 1973, "Shantungosaurus" is known from five incomplete skeletons.

Rhabdodontids were herbivorous ornithopod dinosaurs from the Cretaceous. They were similar to large, robust hypsilophodonts, with deep skulls and jaws. The family were defined as "the most recent common ancestor of "Zalmoxes robustus" and "Rhabdodon priscus" and all the descendants of this common ancestor". In 2005, Paul Sereno defined the family as "the most inclusive clade containing "Rhabdodon priscus" but not "Parasaurolophus walkeri"". The Rhabdodontidae includes the type genus "Rhabdodon", "Zalmoxes", "Mochlodon", and possibly "Muttaburrasaurus". Rhabdodontid fossils have been found in Europe and Australia in formations from 100 to 65 million years ago.

The United States Naval Academy (also known as USNA, Annapolis, or Navy) is a four-year coeducational federal service academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft began it in 1845. It is the second-oldest of the United States' five service academies. It educates officers mostly to join the United States Navy and Marine Corps. The campus is on the former grounds of Fort Severn where the Severn River flows into Chesapeake Bay. It is about east of Washington, D.C. and southeast of Baltimore, Maryland. The entire campus is a National Historic Landmark. The campus has many historic sites, buildings, and monuments. One monument is the Herndon Monument, once a year the upper three classes add grease and challenge the freshmen to reach the tip (usually unsuccessfully).
Candidates for admission generally must both apply directly to the academy and receive a nomination, usually from a congressman. The candidates lacking in academics can potentially receive a nomination to the Naval Academy Preparatory School located in Newport, Rhode Island. Students are officers-in-training and are called "Midshipmen". The Navy pays for the Midshipmen's college expenses in exchange for the students serving in the military upon graduation. About 1,300 "plebes" enter the Academy each summer for the orientation program, this class consists of not only high school students but also enlisted Sailors and Marines. Only about 1,000 Midshipmen graduate after the four years. Graduates are usually commissioned as Ensigns in the Navy or Second Lieutenants in the Marine Corps, and occasionally as officers in the US Air Force, US Army, and U.S. Coast Guard. The academic program grants a bachelor of science degree. Midshipmen get grades on a broad academic program, military leadership performance, and mandatory participation in competitive athletics. Midshipmen are required to adhere to the Academy's Honor Concept.
On 3 June 1949 Wesley A. Brown became the first African-American to graduate. On 8 August 1975, Congress authorized women to attend service academies. The class of 1980 was inducted with 81 women midshipmen.
Sports.
Annapolis has a very broad sports program. All students must play at least one sport each semester, either at intramural (within the school) or intercollegiate (against other schools) level.
The intercollegiate sports teams are known as the Navy Midshipmen. Most of the Academy's teams play in the Patriot League. The football team plays at the top level, known as Division I FBS, in the American Athletic Conference.

The criticism of Buddhism is much like the criticism of any other religion. It is mainly done by people who do not agree with what the religion says and what it believes. The criticism often comes from agnostics, skeptics, materialist philosophy, people who follow other religions, or by Buddhists who want change.
Not true to Buddhist principles.
Criticisms include some beliefs that are only found in some Buddhist cultures and institutions. These are not all true to original Buddhist principles. Sam Harris, a New Atheism supporter, and believers in Buddhist meditation say that many followers of Buddhism treat it as a religion in the wrong way. They say that their beliefs are often "naive, petitionary, and superstitious". ("Petitionary" means making a petition, or a request, as when asking for help.) They think this stops the followers from living the true Buddhist principles.
Some critics say Buddhist followers and leaders have been interested in property and money. They think that they are corrupt and are more interested in wealth and power rather than Buddhist principles. There have been many sex scandals involving teachers in Western Buddhist groups.
War and violence.
Michael Jerryson believes Buddhism has been connected to government since its start. He thinks that the inability to understand the idea of a country without Buddhism leads to a kind of religious nationalism. He feels this is found in many Buddhist conflicts. In medieval Southeast Asia, there were many Buddhist states. These included the Pagan Kingdom, the Sukhothai Kingdom, and the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa. In Sri Lanka, modern monks often took part in the politics of the country. They did this even though the Buddha only believed in helping others make their own choice in the government. Peace activists such as A. T. Ariyaratne have also used Buddhism for ways of doing things.
East Asian Mahayana Buddhists also often get money from the government. The Zen priest Brian Daizen Victoria wrote in his book "Zen at War" that Buddhist groups justified Japanese militarism. He said they helped the Japanese Army on the battlefield. Because of the book, several groups said sorry for their actions.
Accusation of violence.
After the 2008 problems in the Tibetan area of the PRC, China claimed that the Dalai Lama helped to create the problems and violence. A Chinese spokesperson said that a large number of guns and explosives had been found in monasteries in the capital of Tibet.
Feminist criticism.
Buddhism has been criticized because it treats women as less than men. This mainly deals with women monks. Most schools of Buddhism have more rules for Bhikshuni (nuns) than bikshu (monks). Buddhists say that in the time of the Buddha, nuns had more problems like their safety. Monks often traveled in the forest and between cities. Because of this, more rules were created for nuns, for instance: nuns are not allowed to travel alone.
At the 2007 Hamburg congress, The Dalai Lama said that men and women have equal rights, but at times, culture affects how things are done.

Warka is a small city in Poland in Masovian Voivodeship. The Pilica river runs through the city. 11,435 people live there.

The Digital Visual Interface (or DVI) is a video interface standard. It is used to send video between a source (such as a personal computer) and a display (such as a monitor). This interface cannot be used to transmit audio unless it is connected to a High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) converter. HDMI and DVI use the same protocol for signalling, named Transition-minimized differential signaling.
The DVI standard has is widely used in the personal computer industry. Many desktop personal computers and monitors can use it. Most desktop personal computers and liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors sold in stores today have more than one video interface, including DVI. Many other devices (such as projectors and televisions) can use DVI as part of HDMI. 
HDMI is a newer video interface standard. Many laptops still have an old-fashioned VGA connector. Many models in the 2010s have HDMI ports. Fewer laptops have DVI.
DVI was created by the Digital Display Working Group (DDWG). It was created to replace the "legacy analog technology" VGA connector standard. DVI is designed to carry uncompressed digital video data to a display. It works very well with the HDMI standard in digital mode (DVI-D), and VGA in analog mode (DVI-A). It is also found in some television sets even though it has been widely replaced by HDMI.

Tokyo Mew Mew (also known as Mew Mew Power in English) is a manga/anime series by Mia Ikumi and Reiko Yoshida. The series is about five girls who are able to change into superwomen based on endangered species. The girls fight a group of three aliens, Quiche, Pie, and Tart, who plan to take over Earth. The aliens attack the girls by creating "chimera animals" that the girls fight.
The manga was published from 2000 to 2003. The anime was broadcast from April 6, 2002 until March 29, 2003. It was broadcast on both TV Aichi and TV Tokyo.

Beitar Jerusalem Football Club (Hebrew: ������ ������ ���"� �������, Moadon Kaduregel Beitar Yerushalayim) is an Israeli football club from Jerusalem. The club has been controversial because of its links with the right wing politics and to the Likud party since it was created. The fans chant racist things towards Arabs.
History.
The club was founded in 1936 by David Horn. He was the head of the local Betar movement. The Betar movement was a Zionist youth organisation. Most of the early players came from this group. In 1938 the club stopped playing because the manager and some of the players were arrested and deported by the British authorities in Palestine. In 1943, they were able to play again, but in 1947 the British blocked the games on the day the 1948 Arab-Israeli War started. A player was also killed when he entered a British camp. During his existence the club was very successful. The team has never been relegated from the Israeli Premier League. It was one of the original 14 Israeli Premier League teams at the time of its foundation in 1999. In the all-time table of the league Beitar ranks 4th.
The farthest they have ever gone in a European competition was in the 2016-17 Europa League where they made it to the play off round. 
Stadium.
The club first home was the "Banana Field" close to Beitar youth group's "nest". In the 1950s the club moved to the YMCA Stadium. Later it was shared with Hapoel Jerusalem. The YMCA was nicknamed the sandbox because the field was in a very poor condition.
In 1991 both clubs moved to the Teddy Stadium, named after longtime Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek. Initially the stadium was two-sided and held 12,000 spectators. This was increased to 21,600 when a third side was completed in 1997. 

Sadler's Wells Theatre is a performing arts theatre in London. It is in Rosebery Avenue, Clerkenwell in the London Borough of Islington. The theatre which now stands is the sixth building that has been there since 1683. There are two performance spaces: a 1,500 seat main auditorium and the Lilian Baylis Studio. There are many rehearsal rooms and technical facilities. Sadler's Wells is one of the most important theatres for dance in the United Kingdom. Several dance companies perform there.
During World War II the theatre was closed and the dance and opera companies toured to many parts of the United Kingdom. After World War II the dance company was renamed Sadler's Wells Ballet. The opera company became the English National Opera. When the theatre reopened they performed Benjamin Britten's opera "Peter Grimes".
In 1946 the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden reopened and the ballet company was invited to become the resident company there. A second ballet company was formed to perform at Sadler's Wells. This was called the Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet. In 1956 the Sadler's Wells company later moved to Covent Garden where it became The Royal Ballet Touring Company. After a number of years as a touring group, it returned to Sadler's Wells in 1976, becoming the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet.
In 1990 the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet moved to Birmingham and changed its name to Birmingham Royal Ballet. Since then there has not been a resident ballet company at Sadler's Wells.
The opera company moved out of Sadler's Wells Theatre to the London Coliseum in 1968 and was later renamed English National Opera. Sadler's Wells Theatre was used by foreign companies and by dancers at the beginning of their careers. The Lilian Baylis Theatre opened in 1988.
The theatre that now stands was opened in 1998. The first performance was of "Iolanthe" and was given by Rambert Dance Company. 

Hunter Ripley Rawlings III (born December 14, 1944) is an American classics scholar and academic administrator. He is best known for serving as the 17th president of the University of Iowa from 1982 until 1995 and as the tenth president of Cornell University from 1995 until 2003. He also served as Cornell's interim president in 2005-2006. He is president of the Association of American Universities (AAU).
Originally from Norfolk, Virginia, Rawlings received his B.A. with honors in classics from Haverford College in 1966. From there he moved to Princeton University, where he received a Ph.D. in classics in 1970. After graduating from Princeton, he joined the faculty at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He became a full professor there in 1980. Rawlings began his career in academic administration at Colorado, serving as chairman of the classics department and later as associate vice chancellor for instruction. In 1988, Rawlings was named President of the University of Iowa, a position he held until 1995. 
Rawlings then came to Cornell University. He was its tenth president, serving from 1995 until 2003. At Cornell, he was good at asking people for money. Rawlings started several new positions and programs to support undergraduate education. Cornell built of several new dormitories and centralized the location of freshmen dormitories on campus (initially protested by Al Sharpton and others due to alleged racial implications). Rawlings promoted stronger undergraduate admission standards. Rawlings began initiatives in certain areas of science and engineering that he considered important to the future (such as bioinformatics, computational biology, computer and information sciences, genomics, and materials science), and began plans for Weill Hall, a large new life sciences building. He encouraged cooperation between the humanities and social sciences. He also worked on an agreement to start a branch of Cornell's medical school in Qatar.
While President of Cornell, Rawlings also held the rank of professor of classics, and continued to hold this position after he left the presidency. He taught an undergraduate course in classics the last two years he was president. At the same time, many students and alumni leaders criticized his hands-off approach toward the student body and his focus on the business operations of Cornell.
After the sudden resignation of his successor as president, Jeffrey Lehman, effective June 30, 2005, Rawlings became Cornell president again until a permanent replacement could be found. David J. Skorton became the new president on July 1, 2006. (Like Rawlings, Skorton was previously President of the University of Iowa.)
Currently, he serves a professor of classical history in Cornell's Department of History and Department of Classics.
Rawlings is a member of many prominent organizations, including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and served as a committee chair of the AAU. On June 1, 2011, he became President of the AAU.

Wind chimes are chimes that are made up of tubes, rods, bells or other objects that are made of wood or metal. Wind chimes are usually hung outside a house near a garden. They make sounds when the wind blows the parts to collide. In popular music, wind chimes can be used for harmonic music. 
Wind chimes, usually of bronze, were used in ancient Rome, India, and China.

Triglav was an old Slavic god. The highest mountain in Slovenia is also called Triglav. Its name means " three-headed " in Slovene. An insurance company also uses the name Triglav.
Other myths are related to Triglav. These include "Zlatorog". Zlatorog is an immortal mountain goat. It has gold horns. It is currently being used as a logo for a brand of beer. On a mountain near Triglav, there is a formation in the rocks of the mountain that looks like the face of a Giant girl. This is said to be proof of the Giants.

Kandahar is the second largest city in Afghanistan. Alexander the Great visited the town and named it after himself. Alexander the Great founded Kandahar in the 4th century BC. He called it "Alexandria Arachosia". About 500,000 people live there in 2015. It is in the central-south of Afghanistan. Kandahar is the capital of Kandahar Province. It is an important trading centre for sheep, wool, cotton, silk, felt, food grains, fresh and dried fruit, and tobacco. Kandahar has an international airport.

Oliver Heaviside (Camden, London 18 May 1850 – Torquay, Devon 3 February 1925) was a self-taught English electrical engineer, mathematician, and physicist.
Although he was well known in the scientific world during his life, it was not until after his death that people realized how much he had changed the study of mathematics and physics. He used complex numbers to study electrical circuits and did a lot of work on electromagnetic wave theory which made it necessary to find new ways of working with differential equations. He did work on Maxwell's field equations and vector analysis. In fact, he was the inventor of Vector Calculus. Part of the ionosphere is co-named after him: the Kennelly-Heaviside layer. His personality was very eccentric and he is a good example of what many people think of as a mad scientist.
Life.
Heaviside was born in Camden Town, London. His father was a skilled wood engraver. His uncle, Sir Charles Wheatstone (1802-1875), co-invented the telegraph and made famous experiments in 1837 from Euston Station.
Heaviside was short and he had red-hair. When he was young he suffered from scarlet fever which made him rather deaf, especially in his later years. Heaviside studied at Camden House School until he was 16 and continued to study at home until he was 18. He got a job as telegraph operator and spent some time working in Denmark. He noticed that operating speeds were 40% faster from England to Denmark than the other way round, and in 1871 he found a fault in the telegraph cable from England to Denmark. In 1873 he got a copy of the first edition of Maxwell’s book "A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism". He was very influenced by this book and it helped him to produce many mathematical ideas. At this time he was working in Newcastle. In 1875 he went back to London to live with his parents. There he spent a lot of time writing up his discoveries, but no one wanted to publish his papers because they were too difficult to understand. He analysed alternating currents 15 years before they started to be used commercially.
When his parents moved to Paignton he moved with them. After their deaths he lived at Newton Abbott and then, from 1908 until death, in Torquay. He was unmarried.
Eccentric behaviour.
In his old age Heaviside became more and more eccentric. He was poor, and lived alone in a large house in Torquay that he could not afford to heat properly. He liked it when friends visited, but many people were put off because he could often be rude. He could not cook, and a friendly policeman regularly came to the house to bring him food. Because Heaviside was deaf and could not hear the knock on the door the policeman used to open the letterbox and blow his whistle loudly. The house and garden was in a terrible mess. He had lumps of granite in his house for furniture. He often put the letters W.O.R.M. after his name, just for a joke. He took to painting his finger nails pink. On at least one occasion he dyed his hair black and, while it was wet, he wore a teacosy on his head.
When, in 1925, he fell off a ladder and was taken by ambulance to a nursing home, it was the first time he had ever been in a motor vehicle. He told the ambulance driver that he had enjoyed the ride. He died at the nursing home in Torquay a month later and was buried in Paignton.
His work.
Heaviside was like Sir Isaac Newton in that he worked alone and did not always publish the whole of his experiments. He wrote a lot of ideas in his notebooks, but he did not think these ideas were ready for publication, yet they turned out to be very important. For example, he suggested that there was an atmospheric conducting layer many kilometers above the earth’s surface which could be used for sending long-distance radio-waves around the curvature of the earth. In 1923 it was indeed discovered that there were complex, ionized layers (called the ‘‘ionosphere”). The Kennelly-Heaviside layer was later named after him. By 1950, 25 years after his death, there were more than 50 stations worldwide experimenting with radio communication in the upper atmosphere.
Heaviside made studies on how to transmit speech clearly in telephone communication. He studied reflection in telephone circuits (these produced disturbing echoes). From 1886 he spent most of his time on the propagation of electromagnetic waves through space which had been developed by Hertz and on the motion of atoms which had been discovered by J.J. Thomson.
Honours.
Heaviside was not interested in receiving honours. Indeed, he never made any money from his discoveries and often found it difficult to pay the bills. He was probably very pleased to be made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1891. He was awarded a £120 a year Civil List pension by the government. In 1908 he was elected an Honorary Member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and in 1918 Honorary Membership of the Americal Institute of Electrical Engineers. In 1921 he was the first person to be honoured with the Faraday Medal.
A famous quotation of Heaviside is:
"Shall I refuse my dinner because I do not fully understand the process of digestion"?

Rock en español is a Spanish language version of rock music. In English-speaking countries, people call Spanish rock "Rock en español", while in Spanish-speaking countries they call rock music "rock". Rock en español has music from the Caribbean such as ska, reggae and soca. Rock music began in 1956 when Gloria Ríos recorded "El relojito". Chicano rock are rock music sung by Mexican Americans, their version has R&amp;B influences.

Armenian rock is a type of rock music sung by Armenian people. In the Soviet era,rock music was forbidden because the CPSU believed it was a "Western anti-socialist" influence. However, in the 1980s popular rock bands in Armenia began to emerge. The Armenians blended folk music with their rock music. After Bolshevism, progressive rock music began to be popular among Armenian people. Since 2004, the Armenian Music Awards honors musicians who record rock music.

Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport is a county-owned public-use airport three miles (5 km) northeast of the central business district of Ithaca, the county seat and largest city in Tompkins County, New York, United States. The airport is near New York State Route 13. It serves the southern Finger Lakes Region. It is used for private as well as commercial passenger and freight aviation.
For over 50 years, the East Hill Flying Club has been at the airport. The club offers lessons and the use of seven small planes to its members. Taughannock Aviation which provides business jet charter and management is the fixed base operator for the airport.
History.
The original Ithaca Municipal Airport was located west of downtown Ithaca, near the inlet of Cayuga Lake. Its single short runway, proximity to the Lehigh Valley freight yards on the south side, the Cayuga Lake marshes on the north side, and fog in the lake valley limited its growth. Cornell University opened the existing airport on East Hill in 1948 and transferred its ownership to the County in 1956. The former airport site is now Cass Park, including an airplane hangar which was renovated in 1975 to house the Hangar Theatre.
In 1994, the runway was extended from in length to its present and an entirely new, 33,000 square foot (3,000 m2) terminal building opened, replacing the cramped, aging original building. The airport name changed from Tompkins County Airport to its current name on March 20, 2001. The northwest-facing runway 32 has an instrument landing system approach and an associated medium intensity approach light system with runway alignment lights. Runway 14, facing southeast, has an instrument approach based on the VOR/DME located at the airport. A short turf runway was built parallel to the paved runway, but during the 1980s another turf runway oriented north-south was available to the west of the terminal building and was
approximately long and wide.
Commercial traffic peaked in 1990 at 226,813 passengers. By 2000, the airport lost three of its major carriers. The airport was hurt by the small size of the market, relative proximity to Syracuse Hancock International Airport and other regional airports, and crowded conditions in Northeastern airspace. Trans World Airlines, United Airlines, and finally Continental Airlines left to serve more profitable routes, leaving US Airways the sole carrier.
In late 2004, after negotiations with the County, Northwest Airlines agreed to add Northwest Airlink service to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, which began on May 2, 2005. US Airways nonstop service to Pittsburgh resumed on November 9, 2005 but stopped again on April 1, 2006 due to low use. (Pittsburgh is a US Airways focus city.) Passenger traffic improved with the additional service; the airport served about 140,000 passengers in 2004, increasing to around 170,000 in 2007.
On October 6, 2008, Continental Connection resumed service between Ithaca and Newark Liberty International Airport with four daily flights.
Facilities and aircraft.
Ithaca Tompkins Regional Airport covers an area of which contains two runways: 14/32 with 6,601 x 150 ft (2,012 x 46 m) asphalt pavement and 15/33 with a 2,018 x 50 ft (615 x 15 m) turf surface.
For the 12-month period ending October 31, 2006, the airport had 53,038 aircraft operations, an average of 145 per day: 77% general aviation, 20% scheduled commercial, 2% air taxi and &lt;1% military. At that time there were 62 aircraft based at this airport: 68% single-engine, 15% multi-engine, 16% jet and 2% ultralight.
Cornell kept much of the land surrounding the airport to build a research park.
Ground transportation.
Bus.
TCAT Route 32 travels to the Commons and Cornell University Monday through Friday, As of 2010, Route 72 serves the airport on weekends.
Taxi.
Ithaca Dispatch (Cayuga, University, Yellow Cab) operates a taxi stand at the airport, although it may be necessary to call in advance, especially during peak hours. Fares to and from the airport are standardized.

Long Beach Airport is a city-owned public-use airport three nautical miles (6 km) northeast of the central business district of the City of Long Beach, in Los Angeles County, California, United States. It serves Los Angeles and Orange Counties. It is also called Daugherty Field. It used to be called Long Beach Municipal Airport.

A phase is one part of a cycle or change that goes in a circle. For example, the moon has phases. 
 &lt;br&gt;
The seasons of the year, spring, summer, fall, and winter, are also phases. The planet Venus has phases, like the moon: Galileo showed that the phases of Venus meant it must go around the Sun, not the earth.
 can be made for things that have phases. Things that have phases change in some way from time to time. For example, a pendulum in a clock moves from some position (called its "displacement") to the left (labelled -x with algebra), to the bottom, and then to some position to the right (labelled +x with algebra). Two pendulums may have the same length, but unless they begin swinging at the same time and place they will not move together. One may be swinging left while the other swings right. When something like that happens the two vibrations are "not in phase."

Los Alamitos Army Airfield is a military airport. It is one mile (2 km) southeast of central Los Alamitos, California, and within its city limits.

History.
In the 1930s the Long Beach Airport was owned by that city and was also used as a Naval Reserve air station. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, the United States Navy perceived as a hostile attitude on the part of the City of Long Beach regarding improvements and maintenance of Long Beach Airport. Without telling the Long Beach officials, the Navy began looking for a new place for its flight operations. Admiral Ernest J. King, then the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, and Admirals William D. Leahy, Joseph K. Taussig, and Allen E. Smith pointedly requested that the city of Long Beach repair the runways and reminded the city that the Pacific Fleet, then laying offshore in both Long Beach and San Pedro harbors, had a payroll of more than $1 million a month. Eventually the city complied with the Navy's requests.
Still, the city continued to show a hostile attitude toward approving a lease on any additional land that the Naval Reserve required.
The Navy was fed up with the city of Long Beach. It decided upon the purchase of some property owned by Susanna Bixby Bryant, a fact made known by the commander of the base, Commander Thomas A. Gray, to the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Admiral John H. Towers. The circumstances behind the purchase were revealed to James V. Forrestal, Under Secretary of the Navy, and by him to the House Naval Affairs committee who approved the purchase. Although Comdr. Gray had offered Mrs. Bryant $350 an acre, in the best patriotic spirit she sold the property at $300 an acre. The land is 4 miles east of the Long Beach Airport.
With the site acquired, in 1941, construction funds soon followed and Naval Reserve Air Base (NRAB) Los Alamitos began to take shape. The new base provided many jobs and spurred modest growth. On 1 June 1941, operations moved from Long Beach to Los Alamitos.
By May 1942, Los Alamitos was operating with a complete physical plant including administrative office, sick bay, a synthetic training facility, central files, classroom, and an assembly &amp; repair department. With a station complement of about 2,500 officers and men, the initial aviation cadets began their training. The first graduating class numbered 729 cadets, 180 having washed out. By the end of the year, the base's 36 planes had increased to 140, and in 1943, five outlying fields were acquired, Training was carried out mostly in plywood planes. When changed from the command of the Naval Primary Training Command to that of Naval Air Center, Eleventh Naval District, on 15 August 1943, it was used to station carrier air groups. Renamed a naval air station, its flight operations were conducted by a Fleet Air Detachment, with station complement dropping from about 250 officers and 2000 men to 40 officers and 500 men and the Assembly and Repair Department discontinued but still used by the CASU on board. Many CASUs and ARGUSs (groups to establish forward air bases) were formed at and dispatched from Los Alamitos during the war. With additional construction undertaken after mid-1943, the total investment at the station to 1 January 1945 was $4,827,014.64. Growing from one officer, one man, and one plane in 1928, Los Alamitos in 1945 had become one of the Navy's most important air stations.
On 15 August 1943 it became an operational training base for training of fleet units and was reclassified as a Naval Air Station. In addition to providing training, the base serviced aircraft from the battle fleet, including carrier air groups from USS Lexington, Saratoga, and Langley.
NRAB Los Alamitos was initially under the command of the naval operating base at San Pedro, California. Like other Naval Reserve Air Bases established during the 1930s, it fell under the command of the Naval Air Primary Training Command on 1 October 1942; Naval Air Center, Eleventh Naval District, San Diego, on 15 August 1943; and finally Naval Air Bases, Eleventh Naval District, on 10 August 1944. As an NRAB, the mission of Los Alamitos was to instruct, train and drill Naval Reserve aviation personnel living in the Eleventh Naval District.
Many former military personnel chose to stay on in the City of Los Alamitos after the war, living in such neighbourhoods as Carrier Row, where streets are named for World War II aircraft carriers.
As was the case with other naval air stations retained in operating status following the war, Los Alamitos suffered a period of transitions and changes. Under the command of the Chief of Naval Air Training at NAS Pensacola, its missions were to train reservists and service the fleet. On 1 March 1946, while it provided training, CASU 33 supported Air Group 98, but the devotion of activity could be measured by the fact that, as of 28 February 1946, it had only ninety-seven V-6 personnel on active duty as station keepers, yet until the end of September this group provided proficiency flying for more than 1,500 inactive reserve pilots. Meanwhile, CASU 706 supported Patrol Squadron 908 (VP-908), Escort Carrier Air Groups 779 and 778, and Carrier Air Group 716. On 16 August 1946, the first group of aviation cadets in the Selective Training Program came on board, and after 1 September, the station would be used by the Naval Air Transport Service (NATS). On 13 October, the record-making Truculent Turtle, which had flown nonstop for almost 4,500 miles, paid the station a visit. By the end of 1946, with 243 reserve pilots, 1,375 volunteer reserve pilots, 255 inactive reserve enlisted men, and 368 active duty station keepers, Los Alamitos was one of the busiest Naval Air Reserve Stations. Between January and March 1947, the station became the largest in the entire Naval Reserve air training program.
On 17 May 1947, the administration of NAF Litchfield Park, southwest of downtown Phoenix, Arizona, was placed under Los Alamitos to serve volunteer reserve aviation personnel in the Phoenix-Tucson area. With 1,300 organized reservists, 1,682 inactive reservists, 12 over-aged reservists, 7 women reservists, and 583 station keepers, Los Alamitos remained the largest Naval Air Reserve Station in the United States.
On board during the first quarter of 1948 were a light carrier aircraft group (CLG); two carrier air groups; two escort carrier air groups; two patrol plane squadrons; three transport squadrons; four fleet aircraft service squadrons; two Marine fighting squadrons and a Marine ground control interceptor unit; two volunteer units, one at Litchfield, one on the station proper; a NATS Unit; GCA; and an all-weather station. Until it was decided that there were not enough personnel to continue associated volunteer units at Bakersfield Municipal Airport and Santa Barbara, Los Alamitos assumed administrative responsibilities for them. At the station full operations were carried on for five days a week from 0730 to 1630. Saturday night was reserved for night flying. Operations were limited on Mondays and Thursdays; weekends were madhouses as the "weekend warriors" came on board.
On 7 November 1949, Los Alamitos received its first jet aircraft, an FJ-1 Fury. With all FGs replaced with F6F Hellcats, a reorganisation occurred on 1 December 1950 in which there was provided a wing staff with twenty-five squadrons. During the summer of 1950, 105 midshipmen from the United States Naval Academy reported for four days of an air cruise and 112 seamen reported for eight weeks of training duty. Meanwhile, there was a waiting list for pilots and ground officers. When the naval aviation cadet programme, which had opened on 1 July, closed on 25 October 1950, Los Alamitos had obtained a tenth of the cadets recruited in the entire nation. Meanwhile, in answer to President Truman's request for reservists to volunteer for duty during the Korean War, VG-781 requested mobilization as a complete unit, and was accepted – the first squadron in the nation to do so. Three Marine Corps Organized Reserve units were ordered to active duty, and so was VP-772. To speed up training, on 6 March and again on 16 May 1951 ninety-day trainees reported on board. The third group of trainees came on board for training 16 June and many of them and station personnel helped saved lives and property during heavy rains and floods that damaged the nearby town of Los Alamitos. On 15 January 1952, the first helicopter unit came to the base. Also in 1952, a reserve air intelligence unit came to the base.
On 16 July 1957, then-Major John H. Glenn, Jr., USMC, set the Transcontinental air speed record, flying a F8U-1 Crusader from NAS Los Alamitos to Floyd Bennett Field, New York, in 3 hours, 23 minutes, and 8.4 seconds. Project Bullet, as the mission was called, provided both the first transcontinental flight to average supersonic speed, and the first continuous transcontinental panoramic photograph of the United States. Glenn was awarded his fifth Distinguished Flying Cross for the mission.
For the next decade, operations at Los Alamitos were routine. In 1970, however, the Navy closed the station as a Naval Air Reserve training facility and let it serve merely as a Naval Air Station. In 1972, helicopter elements of both the California Army National Guard and United States Army Reserve moved from leased facilities at commercial airports to NAS Los Alamitos. Following approval of an environmental impact statement filed in August 1973, the base was designated an Armed Forces Reserve Center for which the Navy was designated host, and the California Army National Guard was charged with operating the airfield.
The senior command on post is the 40th Infantry Division (Mechanized), headquartered in the large, prominent building facing the flagpole and main entrance artery.
On 23 August 1977, 'ownership' of the base was transferred from the U.S. Navy to the U.S. Army. The U.S. Army 'licensed' the operation of the base to the California Army National Guard. The base was commanded by BG James Benson. Los Alamitos Army Airfield was commanded by LTC James C. Ghormley, III.
In July 2000, Los Alamitos Armed Force Reserve Center was renamed Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Center.
This place served as the starting line for the 14th season of the hit CBS Reality TV Show "The Amazing Race". The base's status as an alternate landing area for Air Force One was mentioned in a West Wing episode.

George Crabbe (born Aldeburgh, Suffolk, 24 December 1754; died Trowbridge, Wiltshire, 3 February 1832) was an English poet and naturalist. His poem "The Borough" which describes life in a small town in Suffolk, inspired Benjamin Britten to compose his opera "Peter Grimes".
Life.
George Crabbe was born in Aldeburgh, Suffolk. His father was a tax collector. As a child he loved poetry. In 1768, he was apprenticed to a local doctor, but he did not learn much from him. In 1771 he changed masters and moved to Woodbridge. There he met Sarah Elmy, who was to become his wife. She had the patience to wait until he had finished his medical studies before marrying him. She encouraged him in his verse writing. In 1775 he published his first work: "Inebriety". In 1780 he decided to give up being a doctor. He borrowed some money and went to London where he tried to become known as a poet. It took several years, during which time he became a clergyman. He became chaplain to the Duke of Rutland at Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire.
Crabbe became well-known when he wrote a poem called "The Village" (1783). It was a long poem which described life in the country as he had known it. In 1783, he married Sarah. In 1814, he became Rector of Trowbridge in Wiltshire, where he stayed. Now that he had a family he did not feel any more need to write poetry and so he wrote nothing for 22 years. He then wrote more poems about the village community, including "The Borough" (1810). By the time of his death, he was well known and a friend of William Wordsworth, Sir Walter Scott and other important literary figures of the time.
Crabbe also knew a lot about insects and made a detailed study of beetles.
Use in 20th century opera.
Like George Crabbe, the composer Benjamin Britten (1913-1976) also came from Aldeburgh. When he was in America during World War II he read Crabbe's poem "The Borough". It made him homesick and he decided to return to England. He wrote an opera "Peter Grimes" which was based on Crabbe's poem. It is one of the greatest operas of the 20th century.

A free-electron laser, or FEL, is a laser that produces a very bright beam of light. It is basically a super flashlight. It shares the same optical properties as conventional lasers such as emitting a beam consisting of coherent electromagnetic radiation which can reach high power. The FEL used operating principles to form the beam that are very different operating principles of a conventional laser. Unlike gas, liquid, or solid-state lasers such as diode lasers, in which electrons are excited while bound to atoms, FELs use a relativistic electron beam as the lasing medium which moves freely through a magnetic structure, hence the term "free electron." The free-electron laser has the widest frequency range of any laser type, and can be widely tunable, currently ranging in wavelength from microwaves, through terahertz radiation and infrared, to the visible spectrum, to ultraviolet, to X-rays.
Free—electron lasers were invented by John Madey in 1976 at Stanford University. The work builds on research done by Hans Motz and his coworkers who made the first undulator at Stanford in 1953 using the wiggler magnetic configuration which is at the heart of a free-electron laser. Madey used a 24 MeV electron beam and 5 m long wiggler to amplify a signal. Soon afterward, other laboratories with accelerators started developing such lasers.
Free-electron lasers use a lot of electricity when they operate. To reduce the energy needed to keep them operating, scientist use an energy recovery linear accelerator to recycle the high-energy electron beam that activates the laser.

Les nuits d'été ("Summer Nights"), Op. 7, is a song cycle by the French composer Hector Berlioz. It is a setting of six poems by Théophile Gautier. Berlioz finished composing the songs in 1841. At first they were just for a singer with piano accompaniment. The singer could be either baritone, contralto, or mezzo-soprano. Later Berlioz changed the work, making the voice a soprano and arranging the accompaniment for orchestra. The first song to be orchestrated was "L'Absence". He wrote this version for a singer called Marie Recio who went with him on a concert tour of Germany. All six songs were published in their orchestral version in 1856. That is how the work is nearly always performed nowadays. The titles of the songs are:

Kirkpatrick Sale (born in Ithaca, New York, June 27, 1937) is an independent scholar and author who has written about political decentralism, environmentalism, luddism and technology. People say he has a "philosophy unified by decentralism" and as being "a leader of the Neo-Luddites,", an "anti-globalization leftist," and "the theoretician for a new secessionist movement."
Early life and career.
Sale grew up in Cayuga Heights, Ithaca, New York, and would later say of the village that he "spent most of my first twenty years there, and that has made an imprint on me–on my philosophy, social attitudes, certainly on my politics–that has lasted powerfully for the rest of my life." He graduated from Cornell University, majoring in history, in 1958. 
He served as editor of the student-owned and managed newspaper, the "Cornell Daily Sun". Sale was one of the leaders of the May 23, 1958 protest against university policies forbidding male and female students fraternizing and its "in loco parentis" policy. Sale and his friend and roommate Richard Farina, and three others, were charged by Cornell. The protest was described in Farina's 1966 novel, "Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me."
In 1958 he collaborated with Thomas Pynchon on an unproduced futuristic musical called "Minstrel Island."
Upon graduating in 1958, Sale married Faith Apfelbaum. She later worked as an editor with Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Heller and Amy Tan. Faith died in 1999.
Sale worked initially in journalism for the leftist journal "New Leader", "a magazine founded in 1924 in part by socialists Norman Thomas and Eugene Debs," and the "New York Times Magazine". He then became a freelance journalist. He spent time in Ghana and wrote his first book about it. His second book, "SDS", was about the radical 1960s group Students for a Democratic Society, of which he was a founder. The book "is still considered one of the best sources on the youth activist organization that helped define 1960s radicalism." In 1968, he signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War. 
Subsequent books explored radical decentralism, bioregionalism, environmentalism, the Luddites and similar themes. He "has been a regular contributor to progressive magazines like "Mother Jones" and "The Nation" for the better part of his writing career," and has continued to write for those publications, as well as for "The American Conservative", "CounterPunch", "The New York Review of Books", and the "Utne Reader". Sale presented public affairs programming for WBAI in the early 1980s and has made appearances on alternative radio over the years.
Views.
History.
In his 1990 book, "The Conquest of Paradise: Christopher Columbus and the Columbian Legacy", Sale argued that Christopher Columbus was an imperialist bent on conquest from his first voyage. In a "New York Times" book review, historian and member of the Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Committee William H. McNeill wrote about Sale: "he has set out to destroy the heroic image that earlier writers have transmitted to us. Mr. Sale makes Columbus out to be cruel, greedy and incompetent (even as a sailor), and a man who was perversely intent on abusing the natural paradise on which he intruded." The book "Taking Sides: Clashing Views on Controversial Issues in American History" presents a debate between Sale and Robert Royal, vice president for research at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, who insisted that Columbus was a courageous risk-taker who advanced knowledge about other parts of the world.
Technology.
Sale "has written extensively and skeptically about technology," and has said he is "a great admirer" of anarchoprimitivist John Zerzan. He has described personal computers as "the devil's work" and in the past started public speeches by smashing one. During promotion of his 1995 book "Rebels Against the Future: The Luddites and Their War on the Industrial Revolution", Sale debated with "Newsweek Magazine" senior editor and technology columnist Steven Levy "about the relative merits of the communications age".
Sale has said that he does not "care much for popular music outside some of the Tin Pan Alley era tunes of the early 20th century." For example, "he once heard a 'racket' in a nightclub during ... the 1960s from some 'young man' everyone told him was a 'big deal.' That 'young man' turned out to be Bob Dylan." Kirk recalls that "he’d never heard anything so awful in his life."
In 1995, Sale agreed to a public bet with Kevin Kelly that by the year 2020, there would be three disasters: global currency collapse, significant warfare between rich and poor, and environmental disasters of some significant size. The bet was turned into a claim on the FX prediction market, where the probability has hovered around 25%.
Secession.
Sale believes that people should be able to break apart large nation-states into small pieces (secession). Sale has been called "one of the intellectual godfathers of the secessionist movement." He argues that the major theme of contemporary history, from the dissolution of the Soviet Union to the expansion of United Nations membership from 51 in 1945 to nations today, is the breakup of great empires. People on both left and right call for smaller, less powerful government.
In 2004, Sale and members of the Second Vermont Republic formed the Middlebury Institute which is dedicated to the study of separatism, secession, and self-determination. Sale is director of the institute. In 2006, Middlebury sponsored the First North American Secessionist Convention, which attracted 40 participants from 16 secessionist organizations and was described as the first gathering of secessionists since the American Civil War. Delegates issued a statement of principles of secession which they presented as the "Burlington Declaration".
In October 2007, the "New York Times" interviewed Sale about the Second North American Secessionist Convention, co-hosted by the Middlebury Institute. Sale told the interviewer, "The virtue of small government is that the mistakes are small as well." He went on to say, "If you want to leave a nation you think is corrupt, inefficient, militaristic, oppressive, repressive, but you don't want to move to Canada or France, what do you do? Well, the way is through secession, where you could stay home and be where you want to be.” The convention received worldwide media attention.
News stories about the Second North American Secessionist Convention in 2007 mentioned the controversial Southern Poverty Law Center's allegations that the other co-sponsor, The League of the South, was a "racist hate group." Sale responded, "They call everybody racists. There are, no doubt, racists in the League of the South, and there are, no doubt, racists everywhere." The Southern Poverty Law Center later criticized the New York Times' October 2007 Peter Applebombe interview of Sale for not covering its allegations.
Sale wrote the foreword to Thomas Naylor's 2008 book "Secession: How Vermont and all the Other States Can Save Themselves from the Empire." Sale continues to speak on secession and other issues around the nation.

Leka, Crown Prince of Albania was Albanian (also known as "King Leka I"; 5 April 193930 November 2011), was the only son of King Zog I of Albania. Leka was also called King Leka of Albania, but he was never the ruler of the country.
He was born in Tirana in 1939. Two days later, the family was forced to leave Albania after Italy invaded the country. When his father died in exile in 1961, Leka was crowned king in a hotel in Paris. He returned to Albania in 1993, but was not allowed to stay in the country. He made a second visit in 1997. The country held a vote to decide whether they wanted to go back to a monarchy or stay as a republic. The country voted for a republic, but Leka said the vote had been changed. His supporters created demonstrations against the government. Several people were killed in the demonstrations. Leka again had to leave Albania. 
In 2002, he made an agreement with the government and came back to Tirana.
Death.
He died on 30 November 2011 in Mother Teresa Hospital, Tirana from heart and lung illnesss. He was buried next to his wife’s and mother’s grave at the public Sharra cemetery in a Tirana suburb. Later he was buried in the royal mausoleum.

Graphene is one of the forms of carbon. Like diamonds and graphite, the forms (or 'allotropes') of carbon have different crystal structures, and this gives them different properties. Graphene is the basic 2D (two dimensional) form of a number of 3D allotropes, such as graphite, charcoal, fullerene and carbon nanotubes.
The term "graphene" was coined as a combination of graphite and the suffix '-ene' by Hanns-Peter Boehm, who described single-layer carbon foils in 1962. Graphene is like a honeycomb or 'chicken wire' structure, made of carbon atoms and their bonds. Graphite is many graphene sheets stacked together.
Three million graphene sheets stacked to form graphite would be only one millimetre thick.
The Nobel Prize in Physics for 2010 was awarded to Sir Andre Geim and Sir Konstantin Novoselov "for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene".
Graphene supercapacitors are among the possible applications.
Graphene oxide.
An international team from the University of Manchester made a membrane of graphene oxide. They showed it blocked many gases and liquids but let water through. Sir Andre Geim said: "Helium gas is hard to stop. It slowly leaks even through a millimetre-thick window glass but our ultra-thin films completely block it. At the same time, water evaporates through them unimpeded. Materials cannot behave any stranger".
Latest idea.
Membranes of graphene will make pretty good bullet-stoppers. Research shows that an atom-thick layer absorbs a hit better than steel. The research team suggests that combining graphene with one or more additional materials to form a composite might be the way forward.
Graphene Batteries.
1. Internal Structure
The internal structure of a graphene battery is quite similar to that of a standard lithium-ion battery pack. There are 2 electrodes and an electrolyte solution to enable flow of charge. The difference is that one of the electrodes in graphene-based batteries, mostly the cathode, is replaced with a hybrid composite material (solid-state metal + graphene) used in place of a standard solid-state metal
2. Advantages
Smaller, slimmer battery: Graphene being a two-dimensional material is only a single layer of atoms. To help understand this better, when you stack 3 million layers of graphene is that you get 1 mm thickness. This means that graphene would allow smartphones to be slimmer than ever and provide more space from additional electronics and allow to place higher capacity batteries.
Higher capacity: Graphene has a higher energy capacity for the same size as compared to lithium-ion batteries. While Lithium-ion batteries are known to store up to 180 Wh per kilogram, graphene based batteries capable of storing up to 1,000 Wh per kilogram. So, the same size of graphene battery pack has a higher charge capacity than lithium-ion or other commonly used batteries.
Faster charging times: Graphene is an excellent conductor of electricity. Its two-dimensional honeycomb structure doesn’t offer any resistance to the flow of electrons. So, it can charge quickly and also provide greater endurance compared to lithium ion batteries.
Graphene patents.
The invention of graphene has led to many patents for its practical application. In 2013 the score was: 
South Korean electronics giant Samsung stands out as the company with most graphene patents to its name.

Rory Williams is a fictional character in the British science fiction television series "Doctor Who".He was played by Arthur Darvill. Rory was first seen at the start of the 5th series. He joined the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) as a companion in the middle of Series 5. Rory began as Amy Pond's fiancé. He was uncomfortable around the Doctor at first. This was because he believed that Amy cared more for the Doctor than she did for him. Later, he shows that he is truly a hero. Amy learns that she has always loved him and they get married. They conceive Melody Pond inside the TARDIS while it is travelling through time. Their baby is kidnapped at birth. Rory and Amy learn that their daughter is River Song, and become related to the Doctor when he marries River in The Wedding of River Song.
Appearances.
Television.
Early life.
Rory Williams has been a close friend of Amelia "Amy" Pond since they were children. They grew up in Leadworth, a fictional village near Gloucester, in South West England, along with their friend Mels. Mels secretly knows that she is their future daughter, Melody and is, oddly enough, who Melody is named after. (Yes, she is named after herself. Time is all "wibbily-wobbly" like that where the Doctor is involved) The kids often played dress up. Amy makes Rory dress as her "imaginary friend" the "Raggedy Doctor".
Amelia first kisses Rory while dancing the macarena. Amelia grew up thinking of herself as "counting as a boy" and Rory was afraid to ever tell her his feelings toward her. She never thought that Rory was in love with her. Because he had never shown any romantic interest in other girls, she thought he was gay. Because of this, she never acted on her own feelings towards him. A year or two before the Doctor returns to Leadworth, Mels tells Rory and Amy that they have feelings for each other. This starts their relationship and in the end causes herself to actually be born.
Series 5 (2010).
Rory is first seen in "The Eleventh Hour" (2010). At this point he is in a romantic relationship with Amy (Karen Gillan). In 2008, he works as a nurse at the local hospital. He is curious about coma patients that he sees in the village. He is shocked to meet Amy's 'imaginary' "Raggedy Doctor" (the Eleventh Doctor - Matt Smith). Although meeting him is confusing, he know it is the Doctor without being told.
During the next two years, the Rory and Amy decide to get married. The Doctor returns the night before Rory and Amy's wedding. She travels in time with him but only after the Doctor promises to return her before the next morning. After Amy tried to seduce the Doctor, the Doctor takes her and Rory to 1580s Venice to fix the couple's relationship. Rory has always a problem with the Doctor because of his connection with Amy and her interest in him. He grows more annoyed and even paranoid with the relationship. It gets worse when the Doctor tells Rory that she kissed him. When Rory says that they should go back to Leadworth, Amy asks him to travel with them. The Doctor agrees and Rory accepts. In the episode "Amy's Choice", They have a shared dream in which they are married and Amy is pregnant. As Rory is about to die, he tells Amy to look after their baby. This causes Amy to see how much she loves him. Rory travels with the Doctor and Amy until "Cold Blood". In that episode, he is shot dead after saving the Doctor. He is then absorbed by a crack in time and space. The crack removes him all of time. As he is a part of Amy's history, she does not remembers him any more because he never existed He was removed from existence completely.
He is seen again in "The Pandorica Opens". He is a Roman soldier in AD 102. It is shown that it is not really him but a plastic duplicate with Rory's memories. He tried to fight his programming, but still shoots Amy. In the last episode of series 5, "The Big Bang", the false Rory frees the Doctor from the Pandorica. He puts Amy inside the Pandorica to keep her safe. The Pandorica is said to be the greatest prison. It was built to keep the person inside it healthy forever. The fake Rory guarded the Pandorica (and Amy) for 1,894 years. He became known as the "Last Centurion". He guarded the Pandorica wherever it was taken. He moved it to safety when the warehouse in London it was being kept in was destroyed during The Blitz. Finally, he helped a young Amy open the Pandorica and set free the adult Amy who had been fully healed over time. The Auton Rory helped the Doctor, Amy, and River Song (Alex Kingston) save the universe from the explosion that caused the cracks in time.
After the cracks were fixed, Rory was returned to his timeline. Everyone's memories were returned and he and Amy got married. When the Doctor went to the reception, he called Rory "Mr Pond". Rory did not like the name at first but accepted that is basically the truth. The Doctor left Rory and Amy for their honeymoon.
Series 6 (2011).
In series 6, Rory is a full-time companion. After the Doctor saves the cruise ship they were on during their honymoon from crashing, Rory and Amy join him again in the TARDIS. After some time travelling with the Doctor, Rory and Amy return to Leadworth for two months.
Rory and the Doctor are friends but their relationship is troubled by Rory's feelings that Amy may love the Doctor more than him. In "Day of the Moon", he thinks that some of the things he hears Amy say are about the Doctor and not about him. He later learns that the comments were about him. He also gets concerned when he hears Amy tell to the Doctor that she never told Rory that she thought she was pregnant. He forgives this when he learns that she was worried that would be a problem with the baby because of traveling in the TARDIS so much.
Sometime before "The Rebel Flesh", the Doctor learns that the Amy with them is not the real Amy. She is a "Flesh" avatar. The real Amy had been kidnapped. At the end of "The Almost People", Rory did not know it was not the real Amy. When the Doctor tells him to move away from Amy, Rory does not want to but finally trusts the Doctor. Rory lets the Doctor destroy the false Amy just as the real Amy begins to give birth to her baby. Amy gives birth to their daughter Melody Pond, between "The Almost People" and "A Good Man Goes To War". The baby is kidnapped and replaced by a Flesh version as Rory and the Doctor fight to get to them. Rory shows courage against a group of Cybermen. He destroys their fleet with help from the Doctor. Rory's memories of being a centurion in the alternate timeline help him to fight the Headless Monks. After the battle, Rory helps a dying Sontaran nurse. In his final words, the Sonaran speaks of Rory and himself both being a warrior and a nurse. At the end of the episode River Song appears and it is learned that she is the daughter of Amy and Rory. In the alien language of the people who raised her there are no words for Melody or Pond. The closest translation of "Melody" and "Pond" is "River" and "Song". In "Let's Kill Hitler", it is learned that Rory and Amy named their daughter Melody after their childhood friend Mels. Rory and Amy later learn that Mels is also Melody. They also see her regenerate into River Song.
As they travel, Rory sees that it can be dangerous to be on the TARDIS. He gets to the point in his travels that he tells the Doctor he does not want to travel any more if they are going to always be as risk.
In "The God Complex" Rory is the only person on the TARDIS is not hunted by the creature that feeds on faith. The Doctor thinks this is because Rory has no faith of his own. Rory also says that after traveling in the TARDIS there was very few things he was afraid of any more. The Doctor sees the danger he is putting his friends in. He takes Amy and Rory back to Earth and gives them a house and a car as a gift.
When River creates an alternate reality by not killing the Doctor at Lake Silencio, Rory is now "Captain Williams". He is a soldier working for Amy Pond. They are not a couple in this version of history but Rory is still in love with Amy. He almost dies fighting the Silence, but is saved by Amy. The two are at River's marriage to the Doctor. In the now-fixed (main) timeline, Rory and Amy are still married and Amy has become a model/spokeswoman for a line of perfume. They are visited by their daughter River, who tells them that the Doctor is still alive.
Reception.
The fact that Rory dies often has been criticized. Digital Spy reviewer Morgan Jeffery wrote, "One of the key elements in Doctor Who is obviously the sense of danger and the lingering presence of death, but Rory's repeated demises and resurrections are now becoming so frequent that comparisons to "South Park's" Kenny seem almost inevitable." "SFX" gave Rory the third spot in the top 10 resurrections of science fiction TV. It said "it's becoming a cliché. But it's not one we mind too much, mainly because it's always done with such gusto. Except, perhaps, in the pirates episode which was a fairly gusto free zone all round".
However, critics have liked that Rory has had many times to be heroic in series 6. After "A Good Man Goes to War" as broadcast, io9's Charlie Jane Anders compared the character to Wesley Wyndam-Pryce (Alexis Denisof). That character's story in American television programmes "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Angel" showed him changing from comic relief to a warrior. Anders said: "Yes, we're thrilled that Rory is getting his Wesley Wyndam-Pryce on. Badass Rory is, as we already observed, totally badass. But this episode exemplified the recent trend towards Amy being reduced to a bystander, victim, or worse." 
Rory's change into a heroic character has also led to a series of "Rory Williams Facts" in the style of the popular Chuck Norris Facts internet meme.

A rhythmite is layers of sediment or sedimentary rock laid down in a repeated pattern. This pattern may be varves, which are an annual pattern, or shorter or longer-term rhymites. Tides in some places have left rhythmites.
Longer-term rhythmites.
Rhythmites can show long-term prehistoric events, such as periodic floods, sea level changes, glaciation changes, earth's orbital variations, and other periodic climate changes.
Many rock formations show repeating patterns of strata. For example, clay layers may alternate with sandstone layers; or carbonate layers alternate with shales. This is usually caused by repeating cycles of climate. In warmer times the sea rises, and carbonate rocks are deposited in shallow subtropical seas. Later, ice builds up at the poles and the sea level drops. Then the same area is close to shore, and gets sand and mud washed down by rivers.
Deposits on land show patterns for similar reasons. A low-lying area will be a lake or a swamp during hot, wet periods, and maybe a desert or a mudflat during dry periods. Erosion takes place during the dry periods, and deposition takes place during the wet periods.
However, temperature and sea-level changes are not the only causes of rhythmites. In volcanic areas a pattern of deposition in lakes may be regularly interrupted by eruptions of volcanic ash, so that in the record of the rocks shales and mudstone alternates with tuff.

A sundown town is a town that is or was purposely all-white. The term is widely used in the United States in areas from Ohio to Oregon and well into the South. The term came from signs that were allegedly posted stating that people of color had to leave the town by sundown. The minority people could not visit after sunset or spend the night in the town (even as a paying hotel customer). Such towns are also sometimes called “sunset towns” or “gray towns”.
History.
Some towns placed signs at the town's boundary with statements similar to the one posted in Hawthorne, California, which read "Nigger, Don't Let The Sun Set On YOU In Hawthorne" in the 1930s.
In some cases, keeping minorities out was official town policy, through restrictive covenants written in land deeds, or by agreement between the real estate agents of the community. In others, the policy was enforced through intimidation. For example, law enforcement officers could stop all minorities found after sunset.
Though no one knows the number of sundown towns in the United States, the largest estimate was that the nation had several thousand. The highest proportion of confirmed sundown towns are in the state of Illinois. It is difficult to confirm sunset towns because the towns did not keep, or do not want to show, official documents stating their status as sundown towns. For example, "One Hundred Years of Progress: The Centennial History of Anna, Illinois," although more than 400 pages long, never mentions Anna's 1909 expulsion of African Americans, the sundown signs at the northern and southern city limits in 1954, or anything else about race. 
Since the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, and especially since the Civil Rights Act of 1968 prohibited racial discrimination concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing, the number of sundown towns has decreased. However, as sociologist James Loewen writes in his book on the subject, it is impossible to precisely count the number of sundown towns at any given time, because most towns have not kept records of the ordinances or signs that marked the town's sundown status. His book, "Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism", notes that hundreds of cities across America have been sundown towns at some point in their history.
Loewen's book mentions that sundown status meant more than just African-Americans not being able to live in these towns. Essentially any African-Americans (or sometimes other groups) who came into sundown towns after sundown were subject to harassment, threats, and violent acts—up to and including lynching.
Other minorities targeted.
In addition to the expulsion of African Americans from some small towns, Chinese Americans and other minorities were also driven out of some of the towns where they lived. Loewen says one example is that in 1870, Chinese made up one-third of the population of Idaho. Following a wave of violence and an 1886 anti-Chinese convention in Boise, almost none remained by 1910. The town of Gardnerville, Nevada, is said to have blown a whistle at 6 p.m. daily alerting Native Americans to leave by sundown.
In addition, Jews were excluded from living in some sundown towns, such as Darien, Connecticut.
Books that refer to Sundown towns.
James Loewen's book, "Sundown Towns" describes sundown towns. Several other books also show the existence of sundown towns. Sundown towns are mentioned in "Following the Color Line", by Ray Stannard Baker; "Free But Not Equal", by V. Jacque Voegeli; "Black Ohio and the Color Line", by David Gerber; "The Negro in Indiana", by Emma Thornbrough; "Mobile Americans: Residential and Social Mobility in Omaha", by Howard Chudacoff; "Race and Kinship in a Midwestern Town", by James DeVries; "The Sociogenesis of a Race Riot" by Roberta Senechal.

A microbial cyst is a resting or dormant stage of a microorganism, usually a bacterium or a protist or rarely an invertebrate animal, that helps the organism to survive in unfavorable environmental conditions. It can be thought of as a state of suspended animation in which the metabolic processes of the cell are slowed down and the cell ceases all activities like feeding and locomotion. "Encystment" also helps the microbe to spread easily, from one host to another or to a better environment. When the encysted microbe reaches an environment good for its growth and survival, the cyst wall breaks down by a process known as "excystation".
Unfavorable environmental conditions trigger the making of a cyst. These include the lack of nutrients or oxygen, extreme temperatures, lack of moisture and presence of toxic chemicals, which are not good for the growth of the microbe.
Composition of the cyst wall.
Different organisms have cyst walls made of different things. The cyst walls of bacteria are formed by the thickening of the normal cell wall with added peptidoglycan layers. The walls of protozoan cysts are made of chitin, a type of glycoprotein. Nematode cyst walls are made of chitin reinforced by collagen.

The Pentium F00F bug is a hardware bug (design flaw) found in most original Pentium computer processors (but not in Pentium II, III, or 4). The bug allows a malicious program running as an unprivileged (non-root) user to crash the computer by running the instructions (in hexadecimal) F00FC7C8. In assembly language, this represents "lock cmpxchg8b eax". If the system has crashed because of this bug, the only way to fix it is to reboot the computer, usually by unplugging it and plugging it back in. It does no permanent damage to the computer, but it may cause data loss. The bug was discovered in November 1997. Many operating systems made since 1997 have protection against this bug.

A skeleton key (also master key or pass key) is a key that can open all of the locks in a set. 
For example, in an office building, each employee would have a key that only opens his/her office, and the manager or owner would have a key that opens all of the offices in that building. 
More complicated setups are also possible. For example, if there are cleaners in the office building, and each cleaner only cleans one floor, the cleaner for a each floor could have a "sub-master" key that opens only the offices on that floor, while each employee still has a key that opens only his/her office and the manager still has a key that opens all of the doors. The exterior doors might also be configured so that they can be opened by any employee key, cleaner key, or the manager's master key. The more complicated the setup, the more important it is to use locks that have a large number of key possibilities. Disc-detainer locks are especially suitable for master keying due to their large number of key possibilities.

Transition Minimized Differential Signaling (or TMDS) is a standard that is used to transport uncompressed data to a digital device. The data transmitted is digital. By using a digital signal instead of an analogue signal, the impact of Electromagnetic interference on the signal is reduced. This mode of transmission is mainly used for audio and visual data.
TMDS uses 8b/10b encoding. The code set is different from the original, developed by IBM. Encoding is a two-stage process that uses XOR and XNOR gates. Whether to use XOR or XNOR operation is selected, so that the number ofsignal transitions is minimal; this is where the name is from.
S/PDIF is a similar standard, used in consumer audio equipment.

A maxi single is a CD single that contains more than two tracks. The first maxi-single was released during the 1970s. There are also cassette maxi singles that began in the 1990s.

A refrain is a verse or group of verses that is repeated at intervals in a piece of music or poetry. In song, it is often called the chorus. The refrain is often very different from the verse in melody, rhythm, and harmonics. It usually has a higher level of dynamics and activity, often with added instrumentation.
In music, a refrain has two parts: the lyrics of the song, and the melody. Sometimes refrains use slightly different words as they are repeated. Such lines are still able to be recognised as part of the refrain by the fact that it is always has the same tune or melody. The rhymes, if present, are also kept even if the words are sometimes different. In popular music, the chorus contrasts with the verse, which leads into it, while the bridge contrasts with and leads into both. Many popular songs from the middle of the 20th century consist only of a chorus.
The word comes from the Vulgar Latin word "refringere", and later from the Old French "refraindre", both of which mean "to repeat".

The Jadeite Cabbage (), or Jadeite Cabbage with Insects, is a Chinese sculpture. It is a piece of jadeite carved into the shape of a Chinese cabbage head. It also has a locust and a katydid hiding in the leaves.
The work is part of the collection of the National Palace Museum in Taipei, Taiwan.
Description.
The Jadeite Cabbage is a small sculpture. It measures only . It is think. It is "hardly larger than a human hand".
Jade is translucent: it lets light pass through the sculpture. The combination of several colors in the jade gives the leaves the various colors of a real cabbage. The sculpture was made from one piece of half-white, half-green jadeite. The piece of jade has many imperfections. These include cracks and patches of different colors. These were used as the veins in the cabbage's stalks and leaves.
The sculpture is seen as a symbol of female virtue. The white stalk is a symbol of purity, the leaves show fertility and the locust and katydid symbolize children.
History.
The sculptor of the Jadeite Cabbage is not known. It was first shown in the Forbidden City's Yonghe Palace. This is the home of the Qing Empire's Guangxu Emperor's Consort Jin. She likely got the sculpture as part of her dowry for her wedding to Guangxu in 1889. After the end of the Qing Empire in the Chinese Revolution of 1911, the sculpture became part of the collection of the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City. The piece survived the Second Sino-Japanese War (World War II) and the Chinese Civil War. It was finally made a part of Taiwan's National Palace Museum.
Notability.
The Jadeite Cabbage has been called the "most famous masterpiece" of the entire National Palace Museum. It is said the be one of the "Three Treasures of the National Palace Museum". The other two are the Meat-Shaped Stone and the Mao Gong Ding. It was picked by the public as the most important item in the museum's entire collection. People thought it was a bad thing in 2009 when it was learned that souvenir copies of the sculpture were being made in China and not in Taiwan. These copies were being sold at the museum.

Alfred Henry Maurer (April 21, 1868 – August 4, 1932) was an American modernist painter. He exhibited his work in avant-garde circles during the early 20th century.
Maurer was born in New York City, the son of a German lithographer. At the age of sixteen, Maurer quit school to work at his father's lithographic firm. In 1897 Maurer left for Paris, where he stayed the next four years, joining a circle of American and French artists. At the time, Maurer's style was realist. 
Briefly returning to New York, he was determined to show his skeptical father that he could paint. Maurer painted what arguably is his most famous painting "An Arrangement", using a woman next door as a model and completing the work (on a borrowed piece of cardboard) in a matter of hours. The painting received first prize at the 1901 Carnegie International Exhibition. Other awards received by Maurer included the Inness Jr. prize of the Salmagundi Club in 1900 and a bronze medal at the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo, New York in 1901. In 1905 he won the third medal at the Liège International Exposition and a gold medal at the International Exposition in Munich. 
At the age of thirty-six, in Paris, Maurer changed his methods sharply. From that point on he painted only in the cubist and fauvist manner. By 1909 he was an important American avant-garde painter. He had a two-man exhibition with John Marin in New York City at the 291 Gallery. Four of his paintings were included in the Armory Show of 1913.
Leaving Paris shortly before World War I, he returned to his father's house, but was denied support. For the next 17 years, Maurer painted in a garret in his father's house, and gained no critical acclaim. However, he took part in exhibitions at the Anderson Galleries and others. He exhibited regularly at the New York Society of Independent Artists and was elected their director in 1919. In 1924 the New York dealer Erhard Weyhe bought the contents of Maurer's studio and represented the artist for the remainder of his career.

Dynamical systems theory is a field of applied mathematics that studies objects that change over time. Mathematicians in this field study equations that define these objects. A classic example includes equations of motion, which have been used to learn about basic behavior of mechanical systems. Equations can either describe changes across finite periods of time (or difference equations) or changes with time being continuous time (differential equations). When differential equations are used, the theory is called "continuous" dynamical systems theory. When difference equations are used, it is called "discrete" dynamical systems theory.
The theory looks at the long-term behaviour of dynamical systems. The study also includes the motion of planets, or electronic circuits. 

William Polk Carey (May 11, 1930 – January 2, 2012) was an American businessman. He was the first person to apply leaseback financing to things other than automobiles. Carey started W. P. Carey &amp; Co. LLC. It is a corporate real estate financing company. The headquarters of the company are in New York City in 1973. The company is the largest publicly traded limited liability company in the world. , the company owns more than 1,300 properties in 24 countries. It owns more than of space.
Early life, career, and family.
Carey was born May 11, 1930 in Baltimore, Maryland. He is a direct descendant of the 11th US President, James K. Polk. Carey's family has long ties in Baltimore. His great-great-great-grandfather James Carey was an 18th- and 19th-century Baltimore shipper, the chairman of the Bank of Maryland, a member of Baltimore's first City council, and a relative of Johns Hopkins. His grandmother, Anne Galbraith Carey, started the Gilman School for boys in the Baltimore suburb of Roland Park in 1897. As a young man, Carey left the Gilman School to go to the Pomfret School in Connecticut. After this, he studied at Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania. He served in the Air Force for two years. He then worked at his stepfather's car dealership to repay his college expenses. He learned about leaseback financing while he worked there. He then moved to New York City. Carey lived in New York City and Rensselaerville, New York. In 1988, Carey started the W.P. Carey Foundation. In 1999, he served as the Executive in Residence at the Harvard Business School.
Arizona State University W. P. Carey School of Business.
Carey was a benefactor to the Arizona State University College of Business. In 2002, Carey gave million to the College of Business. Because of this, the University renamed its business school the W. P. Carey School of Business.
The Johns Hopkins University Carey Business School.
Carey talks with Johns Hopkins University about a proposal to start a business school in the 1950s. John Hopkins was not interested. In December 2006, it was announced that Carey gave $50 million to Johns Hopkins University. He was a trustee emeritus at the school and donated the money through his W.P. Carey Foundation. It was the largest gift given to Hopkins in support of business education. John Hopkins school of business is now called the Carey Business School. The Hopkins business school was renamed after William Carey's great-great-great-grandfather, James Carey. The school offers a Master of Science in Real Estate program. It is one of the first in the Baltimore/Washington, D.C. area.
University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law.
On April 25, 2011, Carey gave $30 million to the University of Maryland School of Law. The gift was given to increase the school's endowment. The school was renamed after Carey's grandfather, Francis King Carey, He was a graduate of the Law School in 1880.
Contribution to The Gilman School.
In the mid-1990s, the Gilman School started discussing the renovations of Carey Hall. It was the school's main building and housed the Upper School students. Carey Hall was named after Carey's grandmother. It was built in 1910. The building had remained the same until late 2006. Carey gave $10million to the school's capital campaign fund. This amount was twenty percent of the total amount of money raised for the renovation of Carey Hall. On December 10, 2007, Carey Hall was re-opened.
Sewanee.
Carey is a direct descendent of Bishop Leonidas Polk, the founder of Sewanee, the "University of the South." Sewanee named an undergraduate business program in Carey's honor. Carey also funded the Carey Fellowships for honor business students. In 2006, Carey received an honorary degree from Sewanee.

Infinitesimals are quantities that are too small to measure. 
Infinitesimal calculus.
Newton and Leibniz developed the calculus based on an intuitive notion of an infinitesimal. In 1870, Karl Weierstraß provided the first rigorous treatment of the calculus, using the limit method. But in 1960, Abraham Robinson found that infinitesimals also provide a rigorous basis for the calculus. Many calculus courses still begin with the difficult limit concept, but others now adopt the easier to understand infinitesimal concept.
In differential calculus, in both the limit and infinitesimal versions, the velocity of a particle is represented by formula_1, where "s" is the position of the particle and "t" the time at which the velocity is measured. In infinitesimal calculus, d"s" and d"t" are simply very small quantities. In general, the term formula_2 is called the differential of the variable formula_3.
Assume that "s" = "t"2, we have that at time "t" + d"t", "s" + d"s" = (t + d"t")2. From these equations, we can determine d"s" in terms of d"t" by using simple algebra as follows:
 formula_4
which means that:
 formula_5
Because d"t" is infinitesimal, one can just ignore it, so the instantanous velocity is "v" = 2"t". One gets the same result using the limit version, with greater rigour. The infinitesimal derivation can also be made more rigorous.

The Second Battle of Ypres was a battle of the First World War. It was fought for control of the town of Ypres in western Belgium. It happened in the spring of 1915. It was the first time that Germany successfully used chemical weapons on a large scale on the Western Front. It was also the first time a former Colonial power defeated a major European power in European soil. The battle was the beginning of a new danger; gas, which will cost both sides thousands of casualties the rest of the war.
Prelude.
During the months of April and May 1915, the two sides fought over Hill 60. The allies captured the hill five days before the Second battle of Ypres began. Hill 60 was on the southeast edge of the Ypres Salient. It was an excellent Observation post to see the salient. Hill 60 would also be involved in the battle that followed. 
The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 had not allowed "projectiles" that carried poison gas. Before the second battle at Ypres, the Germans had placed 5,700 chlorine gas cylinders in front of their trenches. For weeks before the battle, the allied high command picked up intelligence the Germans intended to use poison gas. However, they didn't believe the Germans would do it.
Gas attacks.
The first casualties of the chlorine gas attack in World War One were the French (mostly Algerian soldiers). They were not trained for this kind of attack. When the first Chlorine gas was released into the air, the French began to retreat in massive numbers. This left the Canadians without any French support. It also left their center open to any German attack. But the Germans were unprepared for the results of the gas attack. Their reserves of manpower were low and they failed to take advantage of the French withdrawal. Canadian and British troops quickly filled the gap in the lines to stop the Germans from attacking.
Some Germans were exposed to the gas as well. By the end of the battle the Allies and Germans had suffered massive casualties. The Canadians alone suffered over 6000 casualties. Gas masks were rare at the time, and the Allied troops did not have them. A Canadian ceramic maker was able to recognize the color of the gas. He immediately told the soldiers to urinate on a towel and put it over their face. This isolated (separated) the gas components and stopped the gas from killing the Canadian soldiers.
This was actually the second time the Germans had used gas against enemy troops. The first attempt was at the Battle of Bolimov, Russia in February 1915. The freezing temperatures caused the gas to fall to the ground harmlessly.

Thelton Eugene Henderson (born November 28, 1933, Shreveport, Louisiana) is a federal judge in the Northern District of California. He has played an important role in civil rights as a lawyer, educator, and jurist.
Career.
Henderson received his undergraduate and law degrees from University of California, Berkeley. In 1962, he became the Justice Department's first African-American lawyer in the Civil Rights Division. He was sent to the South to monitor local law enforcement for any civil rights abuses, a role that included investigating the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing which killed four girls. In this capacity, he met Martin Luther King and other leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, after winning over their initial skepticism of being a government attorney.
After time in private practice, he served as director of a Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County office in East Palo Alto, California. In 1969, he became assistant dean at Stanford Law School, where he started the minority recruiting program and helped diversify the student body. He also assisted in creating Stanford's clinical program. During this time, he also was a consultant to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Office of Economic Opportunity, Carnegie Corporation, and Ford Foundation. In 1977, he left Stanford to start a law firm which specialized in civil rights, civil liberties and other issues of constitutional law. He also was a law professor at Golden Gate University.
Federal service.
In June 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed Henderson as U.S. District Court Judge. From 1990 to 1997, Henderson served as Chief Judge for the Northern District of California. Since 1998, he has served as Senior Judge.
In the late 1980s, Henderson presided over a long-running case over the fishing industry's practice of snaring dolphins in its tuna nets. Environmental groups charged that millions of dolphins had drowned because of the industry's refusal to follow existing safety regulations. He
also rejected attempts by the Clinton and Bush administrations to relax legal standards on fishing practices and loosen dolphin safe labeling on tuna.
In a landmark 1995 civil rights case, "Madrid v. Gomez", Henderson found the use of force and level of medical care at the Pelican Bay State Prison unconstitutional. During its subsequent federal oversight process, Henderson visited the prison.
In a 1997 decision, he struck down Proposition 209, the anti-affirmative action California initiative, as unconstitutional. Many supporters of Proposition 209 criticized his decision, and the next year a three-judge Court of Appeals panel overturned his decision.
In 2005, Henderson found that substandard medical care in the California prison system had violated prisoners' rights under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution to be protected from cruel and unusual punishment. Bad medical care had led to unnecessary deaths in California prisons. In 2006, he appointed Robert Sillen as receiver to take over the health care system of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation; he replaced Sillen with J. Clark Kelso in 2008.
In addition to his official work, he went to South Africa in 1985 with fellow judge Leon Higginbotham as a judicial observer and guest of the nation's black lawyers association. While there he was briefly detained and interrogated by white policemen.
Honors and Recognition.
Among his awards are the State Bar of California's Bernard Witkin Medal, the Pearlstein Civil Rights Award from the Anti-Defamation League, the Distinguished Service Award by the National Bar Association, the Lewis F. Powell, Jr. Award for Professionalism and Ethics from the American Inns of Court, the Judge Learned Hand Award from the American Jewish Committee and the 2008 Alumnus of the Year Award from the California Alumni Association at the University of California, Berkeley.
Additionally, the Thelton E. Henderson Center for Social Justice at Boalt Hall is named for him.
A documentary on his life, "Soul of Justice" by Abby Ginzberg, was released in late 2005.

The magnetic moment of a magnet is a quantity that determines the force that the magnet can exert on electric currents and the torque that a magnetic field will exert on it. A loop of electric current, a bar magnet, an electron, a molecule, and a planet all have magnetic moments.
Both the magnetic moment and magnetic field may be considered to be vectors having a magnitude and direction. The direction of the magnetic moment points from the south to north pole of a magnet. The magnetic field produced by a magnet is proportional to its magnetic moment as well. More precisely, the term "magnetic moment" normally refers to a system's magnetic dipole moment, which produces the first term in the multipole expansion of a general magnetic field. The dipole component of an object's magnetic field is symmetric about the direction of its magnetic dipole moment, and decreases as the inverse cube of the distance from the object.
Two definitions of moment.
In text books, two complementary approaches are used to define magnetic moments. In pre-1930's textbooks, they were defined using magnetic poles. Most recent textbooks define it in terms of Ampèrian currents.
Magnetic pole definition.
Physicists represent sources of magnetic moments in materials as poles. The North and South poles are an analogy to the positive and negative charges in electrostatics. Consider a bar magnet which has magnetic poles of equal magnitude but opposite polarity. Each pole is the source of magnetic force which weakens with distance. Since s always come in pairs, their forces partially cancel each other because while one pole pulls, the other repels. This cancellation is greatest when the poles are close to each other i.e. when the bar magnet is short. The magnetic force produced by a bar magnet, at a given point in space, therefore depends on two factors: on both the strength formula_1 of its poles, and on the vector formula_2 separating them. The moment is defined as
It points in the direction from South to North pole. The analogy with electric dipoles should not be taken too far because magnetic dipoles are associated with angular momentum (see Magnetic moment and angular momentum). Nevertheless, magnetic poles are very useful for magnetostatic calculations, particularly in applications to ferromagnets. Practitioners using the magnetic pole approach generally represent the magnetic field by the irrotational field formula_4, in analogy to the electric field formula_5.
Current loop definition.
Suppose a planar closed loop carries an electric current formula_6 and has vector area formula_7 (formula_8, formula_9, and formula_10 coordinates of this vector are the areas of projections of the loop onto the formula_11, formula_12, and formula_13 planes). Its magnetic moment formula_14, vector, is defined as:
By convention, the direction of the vector area is given by the right hand grip rule (curling the fingers of one's right hand in the direction of the current around the loop, when the palm of the hand is "touching" the loop's outer edge, and the straight thumb indicates the direction of the vector area and thus of the magnetic moment).
If the loop is not planar, the moment is given as
In the most general case of an arbitrary current distribution in space, the magnetic moment of such a distribution can be found from the following equation:
where formula_18 is the position vector pointing from the origin to the location of the volume element, and formula_19 is the current density vector at that location.
The above equation can be used for calculating a magnetic moment of any assembly of moving charges, such as a spinning charged solid, by substituting
where formula_21 is the electric charge density at a given point and formula_22 is the instantaneous linear velocity of that point.
For example, the magnetic moment produced by an electric charge moving along a circular path is
where formula_18 is the position of the charge formula_25 relative to the center of the circle and formula_22 is the instantaneous velocity of the charge.
Practitioners using the current loop model generally represent the magnetic field by the solenoidal field formula_27, analogous to the electrostatic field formula_28.
Magnetic moment of a solenoid.
A generalization of the above current loop is a multi-turn coil, or solenoid. Its moment is the vector sum of the moments of individual turns. If the solenoid has formula_29 identical turns (single-layer winding),
Units.
The unit for magnetic moment is not a base unit in the International System of Units (SI) and it can be represented in more than one way. For example, in the current loop definition, the area is measured in square meters and formula_6 is measured in amperes, so the magnetic moment is measured in ampere–square meters (formula_32). In the equation for torque on a moment, the torque is measured in Newton.meters and the magnetic field in tesla, so the moment is measured in N.m per Tesla (formula_33). These two representations are equivalent:
In the CGS system, there are several different sets of electromagnetism units, of which the main ones are ESU, Gaussian, and EMU. Among these, there are two alternative (non-equivalent) units of magnetic dipole moment in CGS:
and (more frequently used)
The ratio of these two non-equivalent CGS units (EMU/ESU) is equal exactly to the speed of light in free space, expressed in cm/s.
All formulas in this article are correct in SI units, but in other unit systems, the formulas may need to be changed. For example, in SI units, a loop of current with current I and area A has magnetic moment I×A (see below), but in Gaussian units the magnetic moment is I×A/c.
For relation between the notions of magnetic moment and magnetization see magnetization.

Left-wing anarchism is an extreme kind of left-wing libertarianism. It is a kind of politics that believes capitalism and the government both need to be removed. These anarchists want to end private property because they believe people who own it have unfair power over others. They want a future based on people working to help each other, instead of for money. But they want to make these things happen without using a government. It wants a society where there is no one in charge. Each person does what they need to without others to lead them. Left-wing anarchism often means the same as socialist anarchism and libertarian socialism. Left-wing anarchists have been a part of anti-globalization protests. For example, the protest in 1999 against the World Trade Organization in Seattle.
Other types of anarchism.
Ulrike Heider, a syndicalist, grouped anarchism into left-wing anarchism, right-wing anarchism (anarcho-capitalism), and green anarchism. People who study anarchists, including Bryan Caplan and Murray Bookchin, do not agree with her. They say her research was not good enough. Left-wing anarchism is distinguished from free-market anarchism and right-wing anarchism (such as that of Murray Rothbard).

Non sequitur means "does not follow." It is a type of logical fallacy: a bad argument that makes no sense. 
It is defined as a deductive argument that is invalid. The argument could have true premises, but still have a false conclusion.
The term ""non sequitur" usually refers to those types of invalid arguments which are not named formal fallacies (e.g. post hoc ergo propter hoc). In other words, in practice, "non sequitur"" refers to an unnamed formal fallacy. 
A non sequitur argument takes something that people accept is true, and says that because this is true, the conclusion is right. The problem is that the conclusion has nothing to do with the premise (original statement that people agree on).
People often have difficulty applying the rules of logic. For example, a person might say this syllogism is valid:
It would only be true if all winged animals were birds (which is not so).

Scared Shrekless is a television Halloween special. It was first shown on the American television network NBC on Thursday, October 28, 2010. The special is once again based on the characters from the "Shrek" franchise. While some of the actors reprised their roles, others don't return (such as Patrick Stewart, who is the new voice of Donkey).
Synopsis.
It is Halloween night, and Shrek's family is celebrating by scaring trick-or-treaters. Inside their house, Donkey, Pinocchio, The Three Little Pigs, Wolf and Gingy fail to scare the ogres, and Shrek claims that nothing can scare an ogre because ogres are "the kings of Halloween". To prove him wrong, Donkey proposes a challenge to see who can tell the scariest story, but Shrek amps it up by choosing to hold their contest in Lord Farquaad's abandoned castle, Duloc. Gingy starts first with a story about his girlfriend dumping him and asking the muffin man for a new girlfriend, made with loads of sugar, thus giving her the name Sugar as revealed in the credits. Gingy becomes happy with her but ends up becoming freaked out of all her love for him. After running away and pushing her in a big container of batter, he finally becomes free of her and decides to go home, but the batter that Sugar was dropped in ended up creating thousands of zombie-like versions of herself, surrounding Gingy and eating him. The Three Little Pigs get scared and run away with Wolf who claims they are his ride. Shrek comments on the falsehood of Gingy's "true" story, saying that he cannot be here if he was eaten, and he runs off as well.
Next, Donkey and Puss tell a story about them taking shelter from a thunderstorm at Boot's Motel. It starts off well but they end up fighting over whose story is better and generally making each other look bad. Donkey gets Pinocchio to spray Puss with water, making him run away. At last, Shrek tells the final story about him as a baby-sitter trying to sort out a crazed, seemingly possessed, Pinocchio, but after continuously getting beaten up by the living puppet, Shrek tries to catch him but Pincocchio jumps out of the window. After landing on the streets, a talking cricket pops out of Pinocchio's head, claiming to be his conscience and the voice in his head making him go crazy, only to be squashed under Pinocchio's foot.
Pinocchio denies that the story is true, but when Shrek shows him a Real Cricket, he screams and runs out. Now alone, Donkey and Shrek hear the wind moving about, and a walking suit of armour calling Donkey's name. Scared out of his wits, the Donkey admits defeat and runs away. Fiona reveals it was her and the babies who planned the ghost act and then they, along with Shrek, celebrate by egging the seven dwarves.

Richard W. Lariviere was President of the University of Oregon (OU) from 2009 to 2011. He is a Life Member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
He became president of OU in 2009. Lariviere's contract was not renewed in 2011 amid a racketeering scandal in the OU Dean of Students office. 
Lariviere has stated that he will remain at OU as a tenured faculty member.
Biography.
Lariviere was Visiting Lecturer in the South Asia Regional Studies Department of the University of Pennsylvania from 1978-79. He was a Visiting Professor at the University of Iowa from 1980-1982. Lariviere was dean of the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Texas at Austin from 1999 to 2006. He was executive vice chancellor and provost at the University of Kansas from 2006 to 2009.
As OU president, Lariviere answered to a number of different groups. He ran into two problems: OU salaries and OU governance. Before Lariviere arrived at OU, salaries were frozen for several years. OU could not compete with other colleges. In February 2011, Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber asked all the public universities in Oregon to limit payroll increases to six percent. But Lariviere found OU money that did not come from Oregon to give bigger pay increases to faculty and staff. This caused the unions to demand a pay increase from OU for their members.
All seven public colleges in Oregon are run by a single Oregon state board of higher education. Lariviere agreed to work with other public colleges to seek more independence in a plan that resulted in Senate Bill 242. Governor Kitzhaber signed that law on July 20, 2011 to give public college more control over how they spend money. At the same time, OU developed a separate legislative proposal (the "New Partnership") to start a separate 15-person board of trustees for OU and a $800 million state bond issue to match private donations to a new OU endowment fund. The governor and state board asked Lariviere to delay pushing for the OU legislation while Senate Bill 242 went through the legislature first. Because Lariviere and OU seemed to be working separately from the Governor and state board, the board voted to fire him on November 28, 2011. He was given 30 days to leave his office. The board hired Robert M. Berdahl as interim president.

Augustana University is a private liberal arts college in South Dakota. It is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The school is in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, United States. The 100-acre (40 ha) campus makes the school the largest private university in South Dakota. Some people call the college “Augie.”
It was first called "The Lutheran Normal School". It was started for the purpose of educating teachers. In 1918, the college got its current name after joining with Augustana College in Canton. This happened because synod officials worried about having enough money to run two institutions so close together. The schools were only 20 miles (32 km) apart. The college claims its founding as 1860, the same as its sister-school (which shares the same name) in Rock Island, Illinois. Augustana gets its name from the "Confessio Augustana", the Latin name for the Augsburg Confession of 1530.
Augustana regularly gets high rankings among other Midwestern schools. Publications such as "The Princeton Review" named Augustana a "Best Midwestern College" and "U.S. News &amp; World Report" listed Augustana as a "Best Buy" in 2009. "U.S. News &amp; World Report" has listed the school a top tier baccalaureate college in the Midwest for 13 years in a row, with Augustana placing third as of 2009. It got this ranking again in 2010.

Davison is a city in Genesee County in the U.S. state of Michigan and a suburb of Flint. The population was 5,143 at the 2020 census. Davison is located within Davison Township. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , which is all land. Davison was first settled in 1842 by Eleazer Thurston. Davison was named after Judge Norman Davison, who founded a nearby town formerly known as Davisonville, now known as Atlas.

A computer museum is a museum for the study of historic computer hardware and software. The International Council of Museums defines a "museum" as a "permanent institution in the service of society and of its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates, and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment, for the purposes of education, study, and enjoyment".
Some computer museums are a part of larger institutions. For example, the Science Museum in London and the Deutsches Museum in Munich. Others, such as the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, the MuseumsForum in Paderborn, and The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park, deal only with computing. Some deal mainly in the early history of computing. Others focus in the era that started with the first personal computers such as the Apple I, Altair 8800, Apple IIs, older Apple Macintoshes, Commodore Internationals, Amigas, IBM PCs and more rare computers such as the Osborne 1. Some deal more on research and conservation. Some museums are for computer education and entertainment. There are also private collections.
The term 'museum' has grown in common usage to include online collections, in much the same way other activities have made the change ('Online shopping', 'Online Gallery' etc.). Online Museums range in type and quality from those that collate and preserve material to those that simply show photographs of hardware from other sources. They are different from traditional museums mainly in that the exhibits can not be touched or interacted with in the traditional sense.

Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion (�ー���� �����ー��, Kōdo Giasu: Hangyaku no Rurūshu?), often called simply Code Geass, is a 2006 Japanese animeseries. It was created by Sunrise. The series was directed by Gorō Taniguchi and written by Ichirō Ōkouchi. The character designs were made by manga artist group Clamp. The series was broadcast from October 5, 2006 until July 28, 2007.
Plot.
The main character, Lelouch vi Britannia, used to be a prince of the Holy Empire of Britannia. He is a genius strategist. He meets a female named CC (referred to as C2). She gives him the power of "geass", which works differently for each person. His power is to force a person to do whatever he tells them to do. The power only works once per person and he must look them in the eyes for it to work. He wants to destroy Britannia. His only childhood friend, Suzaku Kururugi, is the main person stopping him from doing this because he thinks that Britannia can be changed from the inside. Lelouch and Suzaku are at Japan. Britannia conquered Japan after Lelouch was disowned for disrespecting his father, the king. Britannia stripped Japan of its prestige and renamed it Area 11. Lelouch's goal is to destroy Britannia. Suzaku does not agree with how Lelouch plans to do this. Suzaku joins the Britannian army to change the country from the inside. They fight each other—Lelouch's brains versus Suzaku's fighting talent.
Main Characters.

The kōan (; ) are groupings of related questions and answers which are a paradox. The "kōan" may be a story which cannot be understood or explained easily.
The "kōan" can be a special kind of metaphor with a hidden meaning, such as "the sound of one hand clapping".
History.
"Kōans" originate in the sayings and events in the lives of wise men and legendary figures. 
A "kōan" can refer to a story selected from Buddhist historical records and sutras.
The "kōan" is a fundamental part of the history and practice of Zen Buddhism.

Cinematic Sunrise was an American rock band signed to Equal Vision Records. The members of the band were Craig Owens (vocals), Bradley Bell (piano), Bryan Beeler (guitar), Marcus VanKirk (bass), Nick Martin (guitar), and Dave Shapiro (drums). Their only released work, "A Coloring Storybook and Long Playing Record" included a coloring book and four colored pencils with the purchase of the EP. "Basically, the whole idea - everything about Cinematic Sunrise - is just happy and fun. And there's nothing more fun than coloring," explains vocalist Craig Owens about the decision to include the coloring book with the EP.
History.
Owens and Bell were both in Chiodos at the time Cinematic Sunrise formed. The group differs majorly from Chiodos's post-hardcore sound, as Cinematic Sunrise plays more of pop rock and pop punk. The group's debut EP, titled "A Coloring Storybook and Long Playing Record", was released on May 13, 2008. Beeler recorded, and produced the EP. The EP barely reached the Billboard charts, at #196. The EP also hit #8 on the Top Heatseekers chart. It also got to #26 on the Top Independent Albums chart. The EP was re-released in late October 2008, with two new songs. This was because they ran out of the original copies, selling past 10,000 copies.
A Coloring Storybook and Long Playing Record.
"A Coloring Storybook and Long-Playing Record" is the first and only EP by the band Cinematic Sunrise, who is a side project of Chiodos' Bradley Bell and Craig Owens. The pair's pop rock project is all about having a good time and making music that is and fun to play. The record was first released with four color pencils. These would be used in a book that includes drawings of animals with pictures of the band members hidden somewhere in the coloring page. Craig Owens said in an interview that he wanted crayons, not colored pencils. He was supposedly not happy with Equal Vision's mistake.
On October 14, 2008, Equal Vision Records re-released "A Coloring Storybook and Long-Playing Record". The re-release includes two bonus tracks. They were titled "If Lilly Isn't Back by Sunset" and "Crossing Our Fingers for Summer".

The adaptive unconscious is a set of unconscious mental processes influencing judgment and decision making. It is different from conscious processing: it is faster, effortless, more focused on the present, but less flexible. It can be described as a quick sizing up of the world which interprets information and decides how to act very quickly and outside the conscious view. 
In some theories of the mind, the unconscious is limited to "low-level" activity, such as carrying out goals which have been decided consciously. In contrast, the adaptive unconscious is thought to be involved in "high-level" cognition such as goal-setting as well.
The term 'adaptive unconscious' suggests it has survival value and hence is an adaptation which was strongly selected in the past. Indeed, for much of vertebrate evolution, all mental activity was unconscious. No-one supposes that fish have consciousness. Thus our consciousness is added to an already-existing set of mechanisms which operate but whose operation is normally not felt by us.p23
Implicit learning.
Implicit (or 'tacit') learning is when a person learns without knowing it happens. 
An important point made by Reber is that "implicit learning is a fundamental 'root' process, one that lies at the very heart of the adaptive behavioral repertoire of every complex organism". What that means is that implicit learning is very much more ancient than the conscious type of learning that we, as humans, normally notice.
This is an expanding field of research. 
The classic examples are the acquisition of language and the process of socialization. Children learn to speak their native language and become socialized to their society without being conscious of the principles which guide their behaviour.
There has been much debate on the bare existence of implicit learning because of the fact that knowledge gained is not verbalizable. Little research has been conducted on the requirements for the process of implicit learning to take place.
Evidence 1: case studies.
The evidence for there being such a thing as the adaptive unconscious is a series of case studies which are hard to explain any other way.
The Kouros fraud.
After many scientific tests were done on an early Greek statue, the Getty Museum was about to buy it. However, a small group of experts looked at it and said immediately "It's a fake". Eventually, it was found to be a fake. The question was, how could anyone beat the battery of scientific tests just by looking at it? The sceptics were asked how they did it. One said "It doesn't look old, as if it had been centuries under the ground. Another said "Its fingernails don't look right". Apparently they had all seen something which triggered a doubt. Psychologists thought this might be an ancient mental mechanism which has survival value.
The fireman's 'ESP'.
A firefighter in Cleveland answered a routine call with his men. It was in a kitchen in the back of a one-story house. The firefighters broke down the door, laid down their hose, and began dousing the fire with water. This had little effect. As the fire lieutenant recalls, he suddenly thought to himself, "There's something wrong here", and he immediately ordered his men out. Moments after they fled, the floor they had been standing on collapsed. The fire had been in the basement, not the kitchen as it appeared. When asked how he knew to get out, the fireman thought it was ESP. What is interesting is that the fireman could not immediately explain how he knew to get out. From the 'locked door' in our brains, the fireman just 'blinked' and made the right decision. In fact, had he thought consciously about the situation, he would probably have lost his life and the lives of his men.p125
Exceptional intuition.
In a similar way, there are people who can repeatedly do something which seems amazing. It really is possible to spot who is lying, for instance, and it is a skill which can be trained and improved. It is possible to predict which couple will divorce and which will not. The time taken for each decision is short, and (to an observer) the amount of information available to the person making the decision seems very little.
Analysis paralysis.
'Thin slice' decisions based on limited information are one end of a scale. At the other end is the confusion caused by too much unorganised information: 'analysis paralysis'. There are many examples of the latter state being bad for decision taking.
Evidence 2: experiments.
A number of experiments have been done which strongly support the idea of an adaptive unconscious. The basic idea is to bias the unconscious, and see if it affects behaviour.
Scrambled sentences.
Subjects sort out four-word sentences from sets of five word. They concentrate on getting the sentences right. Unknown to them the unused word gives their minds a subtle bias. From one set, with extra words Florida, old, lonely, forgetful, wrinkle (and some neutral words) the experimental group "walked more slowly away from the experimental room".p54 The priming words had biased them to "think elderly". The idea is that of John Bargh.
Priming affects test results.
Priming significantly affects test results. A group being tested about the Trivial Pursuit game were split in two. One group was first asked to think about what it would mean to be a professor. They got 55.6% of the questions right. The other half were first asked to sit and think about soccer hooligans. They scored 42.6%. Other tests indicated that the two groups had similar mental ability. The difference between the results is highly significant.p57
Another test was even more startling. Black college students were given 20 questions from the Graduate Record Examination, a standard test used for entry to graduate schools in the U.S.A. Students were given a pretest questionnaire. One group were asked to identify their race; the other was not. The first group scores were "half" that of the second group. The experimenters later asked whether the question about their race affected them. They all said 'no' and added something like "You know, I just don't think I'm smart enough to be here".p59 Of course, this is of the greatest significance socially. Notice that, once again, the individuals did not notice consciously what had happened unconsciously.
What the ventromedial does.
The ventromedial area of the cerebral cortex is a small bit at front behind the nose. Neurologist Antonio Damasio studied patients who had damage to this area of the brain. 
People with damage to this area are still rational and as intelligent as before. But they lack judgement, and find it very difficult to make decisions. In fast-moving situations, the ability to make fairly good decisions rapidly is more important than making perfect decisions after lengthy thought. It can be a matter of survival.
Characteristics.
Unconscious processes have a number of typical features which are quite different from the conscious processes.
Access.
Obviously, by definition, unconscious processes are less available than conscious processes. Yet there is traffic between the two. For example, there is a well-known tendency for all training to move from halting, difficult conscious steps to smooth, semi-automatic performance. That, as Anderson recognised, is a shift from conscious to unconscious control as mastery is achieved. Anderson's key distinction is between 'declarative knowledge' (knowledge we are aware of and can talk about) and 'procedural knowledge', which guides action and decision-making, but which happens outside of conscious 'view'.
Learning also takes place in ways which are entirely unconscious to us at the time. A classic example is the way children learn their native language between the ages of about 18 months and four years. They do not study language the way an older person does. It happens automatically. Another example: people under anaesthetic can hear and be influenced by what they hear.
Access to memory also happens unconsciously: even when we try to remember, the actual process is unconscious. It can happen entirely unconsciously. An early experiment by Korsakoff on patients with loss of conscious memory showed this. He gave one patient mild electric shocks. Later, when Korsakoff returned, the patient had forgotten all about it. Yet when he saw the apparatus, the patient showed anxiety, and accused him of wanting to give him an electric shock. The experiment has been repeated since in various ways.
Failures of judgement.
It is easy to show that our snap judgements can also be quite wrong, especially when we are overwhelmed with information, or when we come to the decisions with unconscious bias and prejudice.
In experiments, subjects give verbal explanations of their own mental processes—for example why they chose one thing rather than another—as if they could directly introspect (look inside) the causes of their ideas and choices. This 'introspection illusion' may cause differences between the self and other people, because people trust these unreliable introspections when forming attitudes about themselves but not about others.

The Civic Star () is a French award.
It was established by the Académie française in 1930.
The star distinguishes those who contribute to the enrichment of the community, improvement of social life,and the progress of Humanity. It is particularly for those whose lives are of hard work, sacrifice and would remain unknown without this award. It is divided into four degrees: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Silver-gilt.
The star's motto is "" ('To honor the civic virtues - Serving national prestige').

A mathematical model is a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language. The process of building a mathematical model is termed mathematical modeling. Mathematical models are used in the natural sciences (such as physics, biology, earth science, meteorology) and engineering disciplines (e.g. computer science, artificial intelligence). They are also used in the social sciences (such as economics, psychology, sociology and political science). Physicists, engineers, statisticians, operations research analysts and economists use mathematical models a lot.
Mathematical models can take many forms. The types of models include: 
These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures. Mathematical models can include logical models. In many cases, the quality of a scientific field depends on how well the mathematical models built on theory agree with results of repeatable experiments. When theoretical mathematical models do not match experimental measurements, scientists try to correct the model. Such corrections lead the way to better theories to explain the facts.

Galactose (from the Greek stem ������– "galakt–", "milk") is a sugar. It has almost the same chemical structure as glucose. 
Large amounts of pure galactose do not exist in nature. Instead, galactose is usually found with glucose in lactose, a sugar found in milk and other milk products. After lactose is digested and absorbed, galactose arrives in the liver. There it is changed into either glucose or glycogen.

Rioting took place in several English cities, and towns, between 6 and 10 August 2011. Looting and arson also took place at this time. The riots started when a demonstration took place, on 6 August, about the police's shooting of Mark Duggan in Tottenham, North London. It turned into a riot. Over the next few days, the riots spread to other places in London and then to other areas of England. The riots caused five deaths. 186 police officers were hurt. The University of Nottingham found that British people became more racist after the riots. 
Shooting of Mark Duggan.

Jack Abramoff (; born February 28, 1958) is an American former lobbyist and businessman. In 2006, courts found him guilty of mail fraud and conspiracy. He was the center of very large corruption investigation. The investigation led to the conviction of White House officials J. Steven Griles and David Safavian, U.S. Representative Bob Ney, and nine other lobbyists and Congressional aides. He served three years, six months of a six-year sentence in federal prison before being released early to a Baltimore halfway house on June 8, 2010.
Abramoff was College Republican National Committee National Chairman from 1981 to 1985. He was a founding member of the International Freedom Foundation. He later became a lobbyist for the firm of Preston Gates &amp; Ellis and later the firm of Greenberg Traurig. He served as a director of the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, and Toward Tradition. His wife Pam and their five children live in Maryland.
Abramoff's lobbying and the scandals and investigation are the subject of two 2010 movies. These first movie was the documentary "Casino Jack and the United States of Money". It was released in May 2010. The second movie was "Casino Jack". It was released on December 17, 2010 and starred Kevin Spacey as Abramoff.
Scandal and criminal investigations.
In late 2004, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee began to investigate Abramoff's lobbying for American Indian tribes and casinos. In September he was called before the committee to answer questions about that work. He did not answer their questions and pleaded the fifth. In August 2005, Abramoff and Kidan were indicted by a federal jury in Miami for wire fraud in their dealings with SunCruz Casinos.
On January 3, 2006, Abramoff said he was guilty of three criminal felonies related to the defrauding of American Indian tribes and corruption of public officials in a Washington, D.C., federal court. The four tribes Abramoff and his associates had been involved with included Michigan's Saginaw Chippewas, California's Agua Caliente, the Mississippi Choctaws, and the Louisiana Coushattas. It was said that Abramoff defrauded the tribes of tens of millions of dollars.
The next day, he said he was guilty of two criminal felonies in a separate federal court, in Miami. These felonies involved the SunCruz deal.
On September 4, 2008, a Washington court found Abramoff guilty of trading expensive gifts, meals and sports trips for political favors. He was given a four-year term in prison. This time was to be served concurrent ("at the same time") with his earlier sentences.
Abramoff served three and a half years of a six-year sentence for conspiracy, honest services fraud, and tax evasion. He could have spent up to 11 years in prison for the mail fraud, conspiracy, and tax evasion charges because of the influence-peddling scandal in Washington. U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle sentenced Abramoff to four years in federal prison on September 4, 2008. Abramoff helped in a bribery investigation involving lawmakers, their aides, and members of the George W. Bush administration.
Biography.
Jack Abramoff was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey into a wealthy and well known Jewish family. His father, Franklin Abramoff, was president of the Franchises unit of Diners Club.
In 1968, when Abramoff was 10, his family moved to Beverly Hills, California. Abramoff studied at Beverly Hills High School. In high school he played football and was a member of the wrestling team.
As an undergraduate at Brandeis University, Abramoff was Chairman of the Massachusetts Alliance of College Republicans. That group organized student volunteers for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign. He graduated with a B.A. in English in 1981. He took six years to finish his degree. Abramoff got his Juris Doctor from the Georgetown University Law Center in 1986.
After graduating from Brandeis, Abramoff ran for election as chairman of the College Republican National Committee (CRNC). His campaign cost over $10,000 and was managed by Grover Norquist. Abramoff won the election after his main competitor was persuaded to drop out. Norquist was executive director of the committee under Abramoff. He later recruited Ralph Reed, a former president of the University of Georgia College Republicans chapter, as an unpaid intern. Reed was invited to sleep on Abramoff’s couch. At the CRNC, Abramoff created political alliances with College Republican chapter presidents across the nation. Many of these people later had key roles in state and national politics and business. Some of them would later work with Abramoff as a lobbyist. Some of those relationships were a main part of the federal investigation.
In 1984, Abramoff and other College Republicans formed the "USA Foundation". It was a non-partisan tax-exempt organization that held two days of rallies on college campuses around the United States. These rallies celebrated the first anniversary of the invasion of Grenada. In a letter to campus Republican leaders, Abramoff said:
In 1985, Abramoff joined Citizens for America. It was a pro-Reagan group that helped Oliver North build support for the Nicaraguan Contras. Citizens for America had a meeting of anti-Communist rebel leaders known as the Democratic International in Jamba, Angola. This conference included leaders of the Mujahedeen from Afghanistan, UNITA from Angola, the Contras, and opposition groups from Laos. Out of this conference came the International Freedom Foundation. Abramoff helped to organize, and also went to the conference. Abramoff's membership ended badly when Citizens for America's sponsor Lewis Lehrman, a former New York gubernatorial candidate, said that Abramoff had spent his money carelessly.
In 1986, Reagan made Abramoff a member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council.
Abramoff became a full-time lobbyist and used his CRNC friends to gain access to members of the Bush Administration. He represented indian tribes and on-line gambling interests. To get the gaming interest to hire him to fight against new laws to control gambling, Abramoff had his friends start efforts against gambling. Abramoff bought a restaurant in Washington, D.C. He used it to impress clients and government officials. Abramoff got press coverage and was known for wearing a fedora hat. Abramoff started a charity called the "Capital Athletic Foundation". In 2002, Abramoff started an Orthodox Jewish school in Maryland called "Eshkol Academy".
People convicted in Abramoff probe.
The lawmakers, lobbyists, Bush administration officials, congressional staffers, and businessmen in the Jack Abramoff public corruption probe were:
Indian tribes grand jury investigations.
Abramoff and his partner Michael Scanlon (a former Tom DeLay aide) conspired to bilk Indian casinos of about $85 million. The lobbyists also created lobbying against their own clients to force them to pay for lobbying services. These actions were the subject both of criminal prosecution and hearings by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. On November 21, 2005, Scanlon pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe a member of Congress and other public officials.
On January 3, 2006, Abramoff pleaded guilty to three felony counts (conspiracy, fraud, and tax evasion) involving his lobbying activities in Washington on behalf of Native American tribes. Abramoff and other defendants had to pay back at least $25 million that they took from clients. Abramoff also owes the Internal Revenue Service $1.7 million because of the tax evasion. In the agreement, Abramoff said he bribed public officials, including Ney. Also included: the hiring of congressional staffers and conspiring with them to lobby their former employers. This included members of Congress.
Later in 2006 Abramoff lobbyists Neil Volz and Tony Rudy pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges. In September 2006, Ney pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false statements.
SunCruz Casinos fraud conviction.
On August 11, 2005, Abramoff and Kidan were indicted by a federal grand jury in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on fraud charges from a 2000 deal to buy SunCruz Casinos from Konstantinos "Gus" Boulis. Abramoff and Kidan were said to have used a fake wire transfer to make people believe that they had made a $23 million down payment needed to qualify for a $60 million loan. Kidan received the same sentence as Abramoff—5 years, 10 months—which he began serving at Fort Dix Federal Penetentiary, in Fort Dix, New Jersey, on October 23, 2006. Ney also was implicated in helping to make the deal.
After the partners bought SunCruz in September 2000, the business relationship with Boulis got bad. It ending in a fight between Kidan and Boulis in December 2000. In February 2001 Boulis was murdered in his car. The murder is currently not solved. SunCruz is now owned by Oceans Casinos Cruises.
On March 29, 2006, Abramoff and Kidan were both sentenced in the SunCruz case to the minimum amount of 70 months. They also had to pay US$21.7 million in restitution. The judge, U.S. District Judge Paul C. Huck, got over 260 pleas for leniency from people. These included "rabbis, military officers and even a professional hockey referee." The defendants are still helping with federal investigators and will be sentenced later in the Indian lobbying case.
Guam grand jury investigation.
In 2002, Guam Superior Court hired Abramoff to lobby against a bill wanting to put the Superior Court under the authority of the Guam Supreme Court. On November 18, 2002, a grand jury issued a subpoena demanding that the administrator of the Guam Superior Court release all records dealing with to the contract. On November 19, 2002, U.S. Attorney Frederick A. Black, the chief prosecutor for Guam and the person who caused the indictment, was removed from the office he had held since 1991. The federal grand jury investigation was quickly ended and took no more action. In 2005 Public Auditor Doris Flores Brooks started a new investigation of the Abramoff contract.
In 2006 California attorney and Marshall Islands lobbyist Howard Hills, and Tony Sanchez, a former administrator of the Guam Superior Court, were indicted for unlawful influence, conspiracy for unlawful influence, theft of property held in trust, and official misconduct. It is believed that they allowed 36 payments of $9,000 in connection with a contract between Hills and the Guam Superior Court. These payments were written out to Hills, but went to Abramoff. Hills trusted Sanchez as a court official. Hills believed that this was temporary and agreed to help with the transition for what he thought was a standard government contract between Abramoff and the court. For this Hills got nothing. Before indictments or investigations were started, Hills ended his temporary contract with Abramoff and reported what he thought was unusual behavior to public officials when he thought that something may be wrong. In 2007, indictments were issued against Hills and Sanchez. In 2008 more indictments were handed down against Abramoff and Abramoff's firm at the time, Greenberg Traurig. The charges against both attorney Howard Hills and Greenberg Traurig have since been dismissed.
Incarceration and recent life.
On November 15, 2006, Abramoff began serving his term in the minimum security prison of Federal Correctional Institution, Cumberland, Maryland, as inmate number 27593-112. The Justice Department asked that he serve his sentence there so that he would be closer to agents in Washington to help with the investigations of his associates.
On June 8, 2010, Abramoff was transferred to a halfway house in Baltimore, Maryland. While there, he worked for kosher pizza firm Tov Pizza. He earned between $7.50 and $10.00 per hour.
He was released from the halfway house on December 3, 2010. On December 13, 2010, it was said that Abramoff ended working at Tov Pizza.
On 8 December 2011 Abramoff was on The Colbert Report. He promoted his book "Capitol Punishment: The Hard Truth About Corruption From America's Most Notorious Lobbyist".

The Palace of Culture and Science is the second-tallest building in Poland. It is in Warsaw. It is 237 metres high.
An agreement about the building was signed between the governments of the Polish People's Republic and the Soviet Union on 5 April 1952. The tower was an imposed and unwanted "gift" to the people of Poland. It was erected with great propagandist fanfare and named after Joseph Stalin upon its completion in 1955. Stalin's name was later removed from the colonnade, interior lobby and one of the building's sculptures.
To decide on the height of the building, Soviet and Polish architects gathered in the area of the Śląsko-Dąbrowski Bridge on the east bank of the Vistula river. Over the site of the future skyscraper flew a small plane pulling a balloon behind it. The group standing near the bridge had radio contact with the pilot of the plane. First, the balloon flew at an altitude of , then higher at and . The Soviets, led by Lev Rudnev, decided that was enough for the highest point of the city. The Poles, led by the plenipotentiary for the construction of the building and chief architect of Warsaw, Józef Sigalin, began to shout "Higher!" after every of balloon height increase. Finally, the tower was set at a height of , with a main structure, a turret and a spire.
In 2024 it is used as an exhibition centre and office complex. There is a multiplex cinema with eight screens, four theatres , the Museum of Evolution and the Museum of Technology, offices, bookshops, a large swimming pool, an auditorium hall for 3,000 people called Congress Hall, and a university, Collegium Civitas, on the 11th and 12th floors of the building. The terrace on the 30th floor, at , is a well-known tourist attraction with a panoramic view of the city. The Warsaw City Council and city offices are located in the building.

 was an island province of Japan in the area of Kagoshima Prefecture on the island of Kyūshū. The history of the province started in 674 and ended in 824.

A combination lock is a lock that is opened with a set of secret numbers instead of a key. Mechanical combination locks usually have a dial that is rotated to three different numbers (four numbers on some safe locks) to open the lock. Electronic combination locks usually have a keypad where the combination can be entered like a telephone number.
Mechanical combination lock.
The mechanical combination lock usually has three discs inside. The last disc is connected directly to the dial, and a notch on this disc rotates the second disc. A notch on the second disc in turn rotates the first disc. The lock is usually opened by rotating the dial clockwise to the first number, counterclockwise past the first number and to the second number, and clockwise to the third number (some locks use the reverse directions, and most safe locks require a return to 0 after entering the combination). This type of lock is popular on safes and padlocks. It is available for entry doors, but is not popular due to the amount of time required to enter the combination. The combination is usually set at the factory and can not be changed easily (if at all).
Electronic keypad lock.
The electronic combination lock uses a keypad that looks similar to a telephone keypad. The combination is entered one number at a time, like a telephone number. When the number is entered, a motor opens the lock. This type of lock is popular on safes and doors, but is almost never seen on padlocks. These locks require batteries or another source of electricity. There is sometimes a key backup in case the batteries die or the electronics fail. Most safe locks do not have a key backup, as a key backup can be picked. Most electronic locks allow the user to set the combination.
Advantages.
Combination locks can not be picked (as long as there is no key backup), and the user does not have to carry a key. There is little chance of getting locked out as long as the user is good at remembering the combination.
Disadvantages.
Mechanical combination locks can be difficult to use for people who have never used one before. The most common mistakes are forgetting to pass the first number when dialing the second number, and rotating the dial backwards. In an electronic combination lock, the batteries can die, preventing the lock from opening until the batteries are replaced. With most combination locks, it is possible for a thief to obtain the combination by watching a legitimate user entering it. On an electronic combination lock, a thief can sometimes guess the combination based on the amount of wear on the buttons. An example of worn buttons can be seen in the photo on the right. More-modern keypad locks require the user to press one or two other buttons indicated by LEDs after the combination is entered. This causes the other buttons that are not part of the combination to wear down as well, preventing a thief from determining which numbers are part of the combination based on wear marks.

In philosophy, determinism is the thesis that there are conditions that make future events happen the way they happen. Today, the term is mostly used in natural philosophy: there are natural laws and causality that govern certain aspects of nature. Some of those laws are not probabilistic, they apply all the time. The opposite position to this idea is called indeterminism. If there are really conditions that cause future events to be uniquely determined in advance, this will cause problems supporting the idea that there is free will. Other ideas that need the thesis of determinism are called fatalism and predestination.

Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz is an interactive fiction video game published by Infocom in 1981. It was written by Marc Blank, Dave Lebling, Bruce Daniels and Tim Anderson. It was the second game in the popular Zork trilogy. It begins where "Zork I" left off and leads into "Zork III". It is Infocom's second game.
Plot.
The player starts in the Barrow from Zork I armed only with the brass lantern and the elvish sword. The purpose of the game is not initially clear.
The Wizard of Frobozz is soon introduced. The wizard was once a good sorcerer, but when his powers began to go away he was exiled by Lord Dimwit Flathead. Now bordering on insanity, the wizard is a force to be reckoned with. Your goal, as you venture into the wizard's area, is to avoid his tricks and learn to control his magic.

Finding the treasures does not end the game, and finding all the treasures is not needed to finish the game. Instead, the adventurer must figure out a way to use the treasures in order to reach the game's finale.

Relativism is the idea that points of view have no absolute truth or validity. They only have relative, subjective value according to viewpoint and circumstances.
Common statements that might be considered relativistic include:
There are many forms of relativism.
The term often refers to "truth relativism", which is the doctrine that there are no absolute truths, i.e., that truth is always relative to some particular frame of reference, such as a language or a culture (cultural relativism).
As "moral relativism", moral principles apply only in a limited context. In context, principles and ethics do hold; out of context they do not.
There are similar ideas in nihilism, scepticism and amoralism. 
Various applications.
People who agreed with the idea of relativism include Paul Feyerabend, Isaiah Berlin and Richard Rorty. 
The Roman Catholic Church, especially under John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, has identified relativism as one of the most significant problems for faith and morals today.
The Church and some philosophers define relativism as the denial of absolute truth. They say that without absolute truth, there can be no moral values. If there are no moral values, there might not be sin, and God may not exist. In their view, relativism constitutes a denial of the capacity of the human mind and reason to arrive at truth. Truth, according to Catholic theologians and philosophers (following Aristotle and Plato) consists of "adequatio rei et intellectus", the correspondence of the mind and reality. Another way of putting it states that the mind has the same form as reality. This means when the form of the computer in front of someone (the type, color, shape, capacity, etc.) is also the form that is in their mind, then what they know is true because their mind corresponds to objective reality.
The denial of an absolute reference, of an "axis mundi," denies God, who equates to Absolute Truth, according to these Christian philosophers. They link relativism to secularism, an obstruction of religion in human life.
Pope Leo XIII (1810–1903) was the first known Pope to use the word relativism in the encyclical Humanum Genus (1884). Leo XIII condemned Freemasonry and claimed that its philosophical and political system was largely based on relativism.

Cheese analogues are substitutes of cheese that are made to imitate the taste and the look of real cheese. Such substitutes replace the dairy milk by other plant-based ingredients. The fat in the milk is replaced by other kinds of fat of animal or plant origin. Sometimes the proteins found in milk are also replaced by proteins from other sources. Cheese analogues are usually used because of health reasons, for example lactose intolerance. They are also used as a personal choice (e.g. veganism, or for religious reasons). In most cases, Cheese analogue is kosher. 
Cheese analogue cost less to make than real cheese. By carefully choosing the ingredients in the analogue, other characteristics such as the melting temperature and the taste can be changed. Flavour enhancers can be added to make the product taste similar to Parmesan, feta or Camembert cheese, for example. Food coloring is used to match the color of a cheese product. Real cheese undergoes a ripening process, cheese analogues do not have this: Usually, vegetable oil is heated, and mixed with a premade powder and water. Flavour enhancers are added. After cooling, the product is ready for packaging. 
In Europe, cheese analogue is used for gastronomy and in bakeries; In the United States, it is marketed as a replacement for real cheese. The arguments used cater to people who do not want to use real cheese for personal reasons, or that cannot use it for health reasons.

Dangerous describes something that has danger. It can also mean:

Cognitive dissonance is a concept in social psychology. It is the discomfort felt by a person who holds conflicting ideas, beliefs or values at the same time. In this state, people may feel surprise, dread, guilt, anger, or embarrassment. Reacting to this unpleasant state, people have a motivational drive to reduce dissonance. Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance was developed to predict and explain how people reacted to this situation.
Cognitive dissonance theory says that people have a bias to seek consonance between their expectations and reality. According to Festinger, people engage in a process he termed "dissonance reduction". This can be got in one of three ways: 
People in dissonance may change their feelings, thoughts or memories so they are less in conflict. However, often they do not, and instead set out to manipulate the social scene around them so that their embarrassment is less. For example, they may try to explain away the dissonance with a wider theory or they may intensify their efforts at persuasion and publicity so that others join them in their beliefs.
Case study.
Festinger's book "When Prophecy Fails" is the story of how a cult leader reacted when her prophecy of doom failed.
Festinger and his associates read an interesting item in their local newspaper: "Prophecy from planet Clarion call to city: flee that flood". The prophecy came from Dorothy Martin (1900–1992), a Chicago housewife who experimented with automatic writing. She had previously been involved with L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics movement, and her cult incorporated ideas from what was to become Scientology.
The group of believers had taken steps which showed their commitment to the belief. They had left jobs, college, and spouses, and had given away money and possessions. They prepared for their departure on a flying saucer, which was to rescue the group of true believers. She claimed to have received a message from a fictional planet named Clarion. These messages revealed that the world would end in a great flood before dawn on December 21, 1954.
After the failure of the prediction, Dorothy Martin left Chicago after being threatened with arrest and involuntary commitment. She later founded the Association of Sananda and Sanat Kumara. Under the name 'Sister Thedra', she continued to practice channeling and to participate in contactee groups until her death in 1992. The Association is active to this day.
Sequence of events.
Festinger and his colleagues infiltrated Martin's group and reported the following sequence of events:
The experiences supported the idea that the group did have a bias to seek consonance between their expectations and reality. In fact, events had proved conclusively the falsehood of their ideas, but the group rearranged their explanations to give themselves the least psychological pain.

Permineralization is a process of fossilization in which mineral deposits form internal casts of organisms. 
Minerals in water fill the spaces inside organic tissue. The process gives a record of soft tissue as well as hard tissues. Fossils with permineralization are useful in studying internal structures, especially of plants.
Water from the ground, lakes, or oceans seeps into the pores of organic tissue and forms a crystal cast with deposited minerals. Crystals begin to form in the porous cell walls. This process continues on the inner surface of the walls until the central cavity of the cell, the lumen, is completely filled. The cell walls themselves remain intact surrounding the crystals. Permineralization is different from petrification in that the organic material is only filled with minerals and not completely replaced. Permineralization can occur in several ways:
Types.
Silicification.
Silicification is the most common type of permineralization.
Carbonate mineralization.
Carbonate mineralization occurs as coal balls. Coal balls are fossilizations of plants and their tissues, usually made when there is seawater or acidic peat. This type of fossilization gives information about plant life in the Upper Carboniferous (325 to 280 million years ago).
Pyritization.
Organisms are pyritized when they are in marine sediments saturated with iron sulfides.

The Battle of Plassey was a major battle that took place on 23 June 1757 at Palashi, Bengal. It was an important British East India Company victory over the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies. It was part of the Third Carnatic War, and of the worldwide Seven Years' War in which France and its allies fought Britain and its allies. British victory let the British East India Company take control of the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent. In the next hundred years their area of control grew over the rest of India.
The battle took place at Plassey, Bengal on the river banks of the Bhagirathi-Hooghly River, a distributary of the Ganges. The fighting took place about north of Calcutta. This was near Murshidabad which was the capital of Bengal at the time. Plassey is the anglicised version of Palashi. The battle was between Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, and the British East India Company.
The Nawab of Bengal at the period was Siraj-ud-daulah. He:
The following reasons also led to immense anger to the Company causing it declare was over the Bengal Nawabs.
The battle took place after the attack and plunder of Calcutta by Siraj-ud-daulah and the Black Hole of Calcutta tragedy. 
The troubles between Siraj-ud-daulah and the British led to the Battle of Plassey. First, the British had strengthened the fortification around the Fort William without telling the Nawab. Secondly, they abused the trade privileges granted to them by the Mughal rulers, which caused heavy loss of customs duties for the government. Third, they gave shelter to some of his officers, for example Krishnadas, son of Rajballav, who fled Dhaka after misappropriating government funds. Hence, when the East India Company started further enhancement of military preparedness at Fort William in Calcutta, Siraj asked them to stop. The Company did not stop, so Siraj-ud Daulah retaliated and captured Kolkata (Shortly renamed as Alinagar) from the British in June 1756. The Nawab gathered his forces together and took Fort William.
The British sent more soldiers under Colonel Robert Clive and Admiral Charles Watson from Madras to Bengal. The British retook control of Calcutta. Clive then took control of the French fort of Chandernagar. The battle was fought during the Seven Years' War (1756–63). The French East India Company sent a small group to fight against the British. Siraj-ud-Daulah had more soldiers and chose to fight at Plassey. The British were worried about having fewer soldiers. They formed a conspiracy with Siraj-ud-Daulah's demoted army leader Mir Jafar as well as others such as Yar Lutuf Khan and Rai Durlabh. Mir Jafar, Rai Durlabh and Yar Lutuf Khan brought their soldiers near Plassey but did not actually join the battle. Siraj-ud-Daulah's army was beaten by about 3,000 soldiers of Col. Robert Clive, and Siraj-ud-daulah fled from the battlefield.
This is thought to be one of the most important battles for the control of the Indian subcontinent by the colonial powers. The British now had influence over the Nawab. They also got a lot of revenue from trade. The British used this revenue to increase their military power. They pushed the other European colonial powers such as the Dutch and the French out of South Asia. This was a sign of the expansion the British Empire in Asia.
As a reward for his treachery, Mir Jafar was made the Nawab of Bengal. Former Nawab Mutsheed Kiki Khan directed all landowners of Bangla, Bihar and odisa
a not to sell any plot of lands to British East India Company.

Eero Saarinen (August 20, 1910 – September 1, 1961) was a Finnish American architect and industrial designer of the 20th century. He was known for varying his style according to the demands of the project: simple, sweeping, arching structural curves or machine-like rationalism.
Biography.
Eero Saarinen shared the same birthday as his father, Eliel Saarinen. Saarinen emigrated to the United States of America in 1923 at the age of thirteen. He grew up in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, where his father was a teacher at the Cranbrook Academy of Art. He took courses in sculpture and furniture design there. He had a close relationship with fellow students Charles and Ray Eames. He became good friends with Florence Knoll (née Schust).
Beginning in September 1929, he studied sculpture at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris, France. He then studied at the Yale School of Architecture until 1934. Later, he toured Europe and North Africa for a year and returned for a year to his native Finland. He returned to Cranbrook to work for his father and teach at the academy. He became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in 1940. Saarinen was recruited by his friend, who was also an architect, to join the military service in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Saarinen was assigned to draw illustrations for bomb disassembly manuals and to provide designs for the Situation Room in the White House. Saarinen worked full time for the OSS until 1944. After his father's death in 1950, Saarinen founded his own architect's office, "Eero Saarinen and Associates". Eero Saarinen died of a brain tumor in 1961 at the age of 51.
Personal life.
He married the sculptor Lilian Swann Saarinen. They divorced in 1954. He had two children from his first marriage, Eric and Susan. Saarinen then married Aline Bernstein Louchheim (March 25, 1914 – July 13, 1972), an art critic at "The New York Times". They had a son, Eames, named after his collaborator Charles Eames.
Work.
Furniture.
Saarinen first received critical recognition, while still working for his father, for a chair designed together with Charles Eames for the "Organic Design in Home Furnishings" competition in 1940, for which they received first prize. The "Tulip Chair", like all other Saarinen chairs, was taken into production by the Knoll furniture company, founded by Hans Knoll, who married Saarinen family friend Florence (Schust) Knoll.
During his long association with Knoll he designed many important pieces of furniture including the "Grasshopper" lounge chair and ottoman (1946), the "Womb" chair and ottoman (1948), the "Womb" settee (1950), side and arm chairs (1948–1950), and his most famous "Tulip" or "Pedestal" group (1956), which featured side and arm chairs, dining, coffee and side tables, as well as a stool. All of these designs were highly successful except for the "Grasshopper" lounge chair, which, although in production through 1965, was not a big success.
Buildings.
One of Saarinen's earliest works to receive international acclaim is the Crow Island School in Winnetka, Illinois (1940).
While Saarinen was still working for his father, he took first prize in the 1948 competition for the design of the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial, St. Louis. His arch not completed until the 1960s. The competition award was mistakenly sent to his father.
The first major work by Saarinen, in collaboration with his father, was the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. It follows the rationalist design Miesian style: incorporating steel and glass, but with the added accent of panels in two shades of blue. The GM technical center was constructed in 1956, with Saarinen using models. These models allowed him to share his ideas with others, and gather input from other professionals. With the success of the scheme, Saarinen was then invited by other major American corporations to design their new headquarters: these included John Deere, IBM, and CBS. Despite their rationality, however, the interiors usually contained more dramatic sweeping staircases, as well as furniture designed by Saarinen, such as the Pedestal Series. In the 1950s he began to receive more commissions from American universities for campus designs and individual buildings; these include the Noyes dormitory at Vassar. Saarinen designed an ice rink, Ingalls Rink, and Ezra Stiles College at Yale University.
He served on the jury for the Sydney Opera House commission and was crucial in the selection of the design by Jørn Utzon.
Saarinen's architectural firm was called "Eero Saarinen and Associates". He was the principal partner from 1950 until his death in 1961. The firm was initially known as "Saarinen, Swansen and Associates", headed by Eliel Saarinen and Robert Swansen from the late 1930s until Eliel's death in 1950. The firm was located in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan until 1961 when the practice was moved to Hamden, Connecticut. Under Eero Saarinen, the firm carried out many of its most important works, including the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial (Gateway Arch) in St. Louis, Missouri, the Miller House in Columbus, Indiana, the TWA Flight Center at John F. Kennedy International Airport that he worked on with Charles J. Parise, and the main terminal of Dulles International Airport near Washington, D.C.. Many of these projects use catenary curves in their structural designs. Saarinen designed one of the best-known thin-shell concrete structures in America, the Kresge Auditorium (MIT). Another thin-shell structure that he created is the Ingalls Rink (Yale University), which has suspension cables connected to a single concrete backbone and is nicknamed "the whale." He is known for the TWA Flight Center, which represents the culmination of his previous designs and demonstrates his expressionism and the technical marvel in concrete shells.
Eero worked with his father, mother and sister designing elements of the Cranbrook campus in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, including the Cranbrook School, Kingswood School, the Cranbrook Art Academy and the Cranbrook Science Institute. Eero's leaded glass designs are a prominent feature of these buildings throughout the campus.

Saarinen died while undergoing an operation for a brain tumor at the age of 51. His widow, Aline, died of the same disease. His partners, Kevin Roche and John Dinkeloo, completed his ten remaining projects, including the St. Louis Arch. Afterwards, the name of the firm was changed to "Kevin Roche, John Dinkeloo, and Associates", or Roche-Dinkeloo.
Reputation.
Eero Saarinen was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1952. He is also a winner of the AIA Gold Medal.
Saarinen is now considered one of the masters of American 20th Century architecture. There has been more interest in Saarinen's work in recent years, including a major exhibition and several books. This is partly due to the Roche and Dinkeloo office having donated their Saarinen archives to Yale University, but also because Saarinen's work seems to fit in with present-day concerns about pluralism of styles. He was criticized in his own time—most vociferously by critic Vincent Scully—for having no identifiable style; one explanation for this is that Saarinen adapted his modernist vision to each individual client and project, which were never exactly the same.

Crow Island School is an elementary school in Winnetka, Illinois. Several architects worked together to design the building. Eero Saarinen worked with the architectural firm of Perkins, Wheeler and Will. The building was finished in 1940. It is different from many other schools because of its design and its ideas about education. Now, kindergarten through fourth grade students go to this school.
The first jungle gym is here. It used to be at the Horace Mann School, but that school building was taken down in 1940. People who ran the school moved this special playground equipment to the Crow Island School then.
The building won the Twenty-five Year Award in 1971. The school was named a National Historic Landmark in 1990.

Biasing in electronics is using specific voltages and/or currents at points of an electronic circuit to set an appropriate operating point. The operating point of a device, also known as bias point, is the point that shows the direct current, collector-emitter voltage, and the collector current with no input signal. The term is normally used with transistors.

Dorota Aqualiteja Rabczewska, nicknamed Doda or Doda Elektroda, (born February 15, 1984, in Ciechanów, Poland) is a famous Polish singer with one of the largest number of awards in Poland. She was first known as a member of the Polish rock band Virgin. After the group disbanded she continued with a solo career releasing an album in 2007 called "Diamond Bitch" and another album "The Seven Temptations" which was released in 2011. She was featured on CNN, as the tenth most famous Pole in history. In 2011 Polish magazine Viva! put her among ten most influential women in Poland.

The Akutan Zero, also known as Koga's Zero and the Aleutian Zero, was a type 0 model 21 Mitsubishi A6M Zero Japanese fighter plane. This type of airplane was the Imperial Japanese Navy's most common fighter plane during World War 2. It crashed on Akutan Island, Alaska Territory, during June 1942. It was the first flyable Zero that the United States got during the war. The Americans fixed the plane and test pilots flew it to find out how it worked. American tacticians were able to find ways to defeat the Zero.
Tadayoshi Koga was the pilot. He was a 19-year-old flight petty officer first class. He launched from the Japanese aircraft carrier Ryūjō as part of a June 4 1942 raid on Dutch Harbor, Alaska. Small gun fire cut the oil line in the plane. Without oil, the plane crashed and killed the pilot. The plane did not break apart in the crash. The pilots of other Zero planes flying with Koga thought that he might be alive. Because of this, they did not try to destroy his plane. The Americans got the plane in July.
The Akutan Zero was very important to the American war effort. Some said it may have been "one of the greatest prizes of the Pacific war". Japanese historian Masatake Okumiya thought that losing the Akutan Zero to the Americans was similar to Japan losing the Battle of Midway. He said it made Japan lose the war sooner. On the other hand, John Lundstrom is among those who do not agree with "the contention that it took dissection of Koga's Zero to create tactics that beat the fabled airplane".
The Akutan Zero was destroyed in a training accident in 1945. Parts of the plane are kept in several museums in the United States.

Mr. Johnson is a character in "Sesame Street". He is Grover's regular customer at Charlie's Restaurant and other restaurants as well. He is a fat Anything Muppet who has become increasingly frustrated over the years with the service Grover provides (however, in the earlier skits, the situation was reversed, Mr. Johnson was calm, but Grover was the one who would get exasperated). Mr. Johnson was mainly performed by Jerry Nelson, and is mostly seen as a customer at Charlie's Restaurant. Mr. Johnson is always called "Sir" politely by Grover.

Haemocyanin (or hemocyanin) is a protein which transports oxygen in the bodies of some invertebrates. Their active centre has two copper atoms which reversibly bind a single oxygen molecule (O2). Unlike the hemoglobin in red blood cells found in vertebrates, hemocyanins are not bound to blood cells. The molecules are carried in the haemolymph. 
Hemocyanins are found only in the Mollusca and Arthropoda. However, the molecule is used only in a few insects. This is because insects evolved another system: the direct transfer of oxygen to tissues by a system of tubes called trachea. This delivers oxygen direct to the wing muscles and other organs.

Linear programming or Linear optimisation is a field of mathematics that deals with finding optimal values or solutions that can be described with linear equations and inequalities. Very often this involves finding the minimal or maximal values, given some conditions, or constraints. Linear programming is often used for problems where no exact solution is known, for example for planning traffic flows. Linear programming is one of the main methods used in Operations research. Linear optimization is a special case of Convex optimization. It forms the basis for several methods of solving problems of Integer programming. In many cases, the solutions of linear programs can be mapped to Polyhedra, which allows solving and modelling certain problems geometrically. 
In the case of linear programming, the word "programming" should be seen as "planning"; George Dantzig coined the term in the 1940s, long before computers were used to solve such problems. Looking at the information theory complexity, linear programming problems are simple, and can be solved efficiently using algorithms such as the interior point method. In many cases, the Simplex algorithm developed by Dantzig has proven to be very fast, even though its complexity is exponential, in the worst case. 
Leonid Kantorovich developed the first methods of linear programming in 1939.

Gerald Joseph "Gerry" Mulligan (April 6, 1927 – January 20, 1996) was an American jazz saxophonist, clarinetist, composer and arranger. He was born in New York City.
Though Mulligan is primarily known as one of the leading baritone saxophonists in jazz history – playing the instrument with a light and airy tone in the era of cool jazz – he was also a notable arranger, working with Claude Thornhill, Miles Davis, Stan Kenton, and others. Mulligan's pianoless quartet of the early 1950s with trumpeter Chet Baker is still regarded as one of the more important cool jazz groups. Mulligan was also a skilled pianist and played several other reed instruments. Mulligan reportedly had a relationship with actress Judy Holliday until she died in 1965, and with actress Sandy Dennis from 1965 until they broke up in 1976.
Mulligan died of problems caused by knee surgery while suffering from liver cancer on January 20, 1996 at a hospital in Darien, Connecticut at the age of 68.

No Motherland Without You is a North Korean song. It is the signature song of Kim Jong-il. The song tells of the talent and virtues of Jong-il, and the attachment of the Korean people for him. The song's chorus is "We cannot exist without you, Comrade Kim Jong-il! The motherland cannot exist without you!" It is also thought to be the anthem of Songun politics because Jong-il started the Songun (military-first) policy of North Korean politics in 1995. It is often broadcast on the radio and from loudspeakers on the streets of Pyongyang.
Lyrics.
The civil lyrics use the phrase "�����" ("Comrade Kim Jong-il") to refer to the son of Kim Il-sung. The military version of the song refers to the North Korean leader as "�����" (transl. "Gim Jeong-il jang-gun"; eng. "General Kim Jong-il") because he was the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army since 1991. The lyrics used by the Korean Workers' Party are as follows:

Amy Tan (born February 19, 1952) is an American writer. Her works deal with mother-daughter relationships. Her most well-known work is "The Joy Luck Club". It has been translated into 35 languages. In 1993, a movie was made based on the book.
Tan has written several other novels. These include "The Kitchen God's Wife", "The Hundred Secret Senses", "The Bonesetter's Daughter" and "Saving Fish from Drowning". She also wrote a collection of non-fiction essays entitled "The Opposite of Fate: A Book of Musings." Her novel "Saving Fish from Drowning" explores the problems dealt with by a group of people who disappear while on an art expedition in the jungles of Burma. Tan has also written two children's books: "The Moon Lady" (1992) and "Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat" (1994). "Sagwa" was turned into an animated series which aired on PBS. She also appeared on PBS in a short spot encouraging children to write.
She is a child of Chinese immigrants: John and Daisy Tan.

The Stop Online Piracy Act or SOPA was a proposed American law to stop copyright infringement on the Internet.
The Internet community had major discussion over it in 2011 and 2012, but the bill was not passed. Some experts said the proposed changes to the internet would have worldwide effects.
Many critics said it would have bad unintended consequences.
Protest.
Some people and businesses supported the new law. Others were alarmed. Supporters worried that current copyright laws are not effective in shutting down piracy websites. The opponents worried that it is a kind of censorship. It is hard to tell which side is correct because the language in the law is still being written.
The English Wikipedia masked most of its pages with a banner on January 18, 2012. They used JavaScript to do this, which means that people could avoid the banner by just disabling JavaScript in their browser. The Wikipedia blackout is intended to spotlight the value of open access to information on the Internet.
Other websites joined protests against SOPA. For example, Google put up a black censor board in front of its logo.
Many critics questioned the value and likely effects of the protests. Some people questioned the timing of the protests.

Loyalists were people in the Thirteen Colonies who opposed the American Revolutionary War. They were also called Tories. They fought with the British against the Continental Army and Continental Congress that they felt was oppressing them. In many areas, Loyalists were treated very roughly by revolutionaries (who often called themselves "Patriots"). Tory lands and other properties were taken away, and sometimes they were put into jail or even killed. Some formed militias, fighting along with the British Army against the rebels.
After the war, many Loyalists sought asylum in Canada to escape the new United States and to stay loyal to King George and the British Empire.
Loyalists came from all walks of life. The majority were small farmers, artisans and shopkeepers. Not surprisingly, most British officials remained loyal to the Crown. Wealthy merchants tended to remain loyal, as did Anglican ministers, especially in Puritan New England. Loyalists also included some blacks (to whom the British promised freedom), Indians, indentured servants and some German immigrants, who supported the Crown mainly because George III was of German origin.
The number of Loyalists in each colony varied. Recent estimates suggest that half the population of New York was Loyalist; it had an aristocratic culture and was occupied throughout the Revolution by the British. In the Carolinas, back-country farmers were Loyalist, whereas the Tidewater planters tended to support the Revolution.
During the Revolution, most Loyalists suffered little from their views. However, a minority, about 19,000 Loyalists, armed and supplied by the British, fought in the conflict.
The Paris Peace Treaty required Congress to restore property confiscated from Loyalists. The heirs of William Penn in Pennsylvania, for example, and those of George Calvert in Maryland received generous settlements. In the Carolinas, where enmity between rebels and Loyalists was especially strong, few of the latter regained their property. In New York and the Carolinas, the confiscations from Loyalists resulted in something of a social revolution as large estates were parceled out to yeoman farmers.
About 100,000 Loyalists left the country, including William Franklin, the son of Benjamin, and John Singleton Copley, the greatest American painter of the period. Most settled in Canada. Brantford, Ontario for example was started by Iroquois refugees. Some eventually returned, although several state governments excluded the Loyalists from holding public office. Most of the Black Loyalists left, as they faced re-enslavement if they remained in the USA. In the decades after the Revolution, Americans preferred to forget about the Loyalists. Apart from Copley, the Loyalists became nonpersons in American history.

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture (an idea which many people think is likely) in mathematics. It is named after Lothar Collatz. He first proposed it in 1937. It is about what happens when something is done repeatedly (over and over) starting at some positive integer "n":
The conjecture states that if "n" is positive, "n" will always reach one.
The problem is verified for all numbers below formula_2 by computer. 
Here is an example sequence:
Debate.
Many mathematicians argue over if it is really true. Numbers in the quadrillions have been tested but it has still remained true. However, this is still very less compared to another conjecture that had been proved false in 1978. There are two outcomes where it is false: a number keeps growing towards infinity, or an extremely large number forms its own loop.

Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell, often called neutrophil granulocytes. They destroy bacteria (and other parasites like fungi) during an infection. They get to the site of an injury within minutes. They have tiny granules full of enzymes and peptides which chop up the bacteria after they have taken them in.
The process of taking in bacteria is called phagocytosis. The bacteria end up in a vacuole inside the neutrophil. The enzymes then get to work on destroying the bacteria. Neutrophils are an important part of the body's immune system. They are a kind of granulocyte, and have a short life-span of a couple of days.

The Euston Arch was an archway built at the front of Euston railway station in London. It was built in 1837 by the London and Birmingham Railway. The people in charge of the new and modern railway wanted passengers to have a good feeling about the station. They built the large arch as a gate in front of the station to attract attention. 
Four columns supported the arch. The outside two columns were plain and square. The inside two were circular and decorated in the Doric style. This Doric style gave the arch its common name of "The Doric Arch".
Originally, the words "London and Birmingham Railway" marked the top of the gate. In 1870, the letters EUSTON in gold were carved into the beam across the tops of the four columns. This railway company had joined other companies to form the London and North Western Railway. This new company did not want passengers to use the old name. It changed the name of the arch from the company name to the station name.
Demolition.
In 1960s, Britain was modernising the railways. Diesel locomotives were replacing of steam locomotives. Overhead electric wires were added to the important line from Euston Station in London to the North West of England. The old Euston station was also to replaced. The railway added more platforms and more space at the front of the station for cars. By 1961 the Arch had been removed.
Birmingham.
The Northern station of the railway was at Curzon Street in Birmingham. That station was decorated with large pillars too and it still stands today. The columns at Curzon Street are Ionic instead of Doric. This means that the columns are plain, not fluted.

The Protect Intellectual Property Act (Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act), also called PIPA, was a proposed American law to stop copyright infringement on the Internet. The law would give copyright holders new ways to deal with websites infringing copyright.
Critics said the proposed law would have hidden risks and unintended consequences.
Protest.
Some people and businesses support the law while others are alarmed by the law. Supporters worry that the current copyright law is not effective in shutting down piracy websites. Opponents worry that the law is a kind of censorship. It is hard to tell which side is correct because the language in the law is still being written.

Ernest "Ernie" Banks (January 31, 1931 – January 23, 2015) was a former Major League Baseball player. He was a shortstop and a first baseman. He spent his entire 19-year career with the Chicago Cubs of the National League (1953–1971). 
He hit 512 home runs in his career. Very few players have hit more than 500 home runs in their careers. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1977. He was known as "Mr. Cub". 
In 2013, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.
High school years.
Banks was born in Dallas, Texas and went to Booker T. Washington High School in that city. He was a very good athlete. He won "letters" in football, basketball and track. He graduated in 1950.
Baseball career.
Banks signed with the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League in 1950. He broke into the Major Leagues in 1953 with the Chicago Cubs. He was their first black player. He played for the Cubs his entire career. He started at shortstop, then moved to first base in 1962.
In 1955, he set the record for grand slam home runs in a single season with five. That record stood for over thirty years.
Banks won the National League Most Valuable Player Award twice, in 1958 and 1959. He became the first shortstop in the history of the National League to win the MVP award in back to back seasons.
On May 12, 1970, at Chicago's Wrigley Field, Banks hit his 500th career home run. Banks finished his career with 512 home runs, and his 277 homers as a shortstop were the most ever at the time of his retirement. (Cal Ripken, Jr. now holds the record for most homers as a shortstop with 345.) Banks holds Cubs records for games played (2,528), at-bats (9,421), extra-base hits (1,009), and total bases (4,706).
During Banks' career, the Cubs as a team often played poorly. They started to play better late in his career, but they never got into the playoffs. Banks holds the Major League record for most games played without a playoff appearance (2,528).
Coaching career.
In 1977 Banks was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. The beginning of Banks' speech that August 8 can be heard on a CD called "Baseball's Greatest Hits Vol. II". Commissioner of Baseball Bowie Kuhn presents Banks, who then says, "Thank you very much, Commissioner, for the fine introduction. We've got the setting - sunshine, fresh air; we've got the team behind us so . . . "'Let's play two!""
Banks had worn number 14 on his Cubs uniform. In 1982 he became the first Cubs players whose number was retired by the team.
On March 31, 2008, a statue of Banks was put outside Wrigley Field. The base of the statue repeats his famous saying, "Lets play two!" 
Death.
Banks died of a heart attack at a Chicago hospital on January 23, 2015, eight days before his 84th birthday. His death was announced by his lawyer in that same day. He was buried in Graceland Cemetery, just a few blocks north of Wrigley Field.

Aberdeen Airport is an international airport in Aberdeen, Scotland.
It is about 5 nautical miles (5.8 miles or 9.3 km) northwest of Aberdeen city centre. 2.76 million passengers used Aberdeen Airport in 2010, a reduction of 7.4% from 2009. It is the 15th busiest airport in the UK. The airport was the second busiest airport in Scotland, and sixth busiest in the United Kingdom by number of flights in 2010.
The airport is owned and operated by BAA, which is a Spanish company. It operates six British airports, including Heathrow Airport.
Aberdeen Airport is a base for BMI Regional (part of BMI) and Eastern Airways. The Airport is also the main heliport for the Scottish offshore oil industry. 
The airport has one main passenger terminal, serving scheduled and charter holiday flights. There are three terminals for North Sea helicopter operations, used by Bristow Helicopters, CHC-Scotia, and Bond Offshore Helicopters. There is also a small terminal next to the main passenger terminal, Broomfield House, used for oil company charter flights to Scatsta in Shetland, operated by Eastern Airways.
Heliport.
Aberdeen Airport has the world's largest commercial heliport which has more than 400,000 passengers each year.
With the newer aircraft, helicopters can reach the northern most platforms on both the East and west of Shetland areas. However, helicopters often use Wick, Kirkwall, Scatsa and Sumburgh for refuelling stops.

In grammar, a person is the way of referring to someone taking part in an event, such as the person talking, the person being talked to, the person being talked about. Grammatical persons are accomplished by pronouns, words used to take the place of a noun, in order to make speech easier.
The first person is the speaker referring to himself or herself. The second person is the person whom someone is speaking to or writing to.
Effect on nouns.
Very few nouns are second-person nouns because people do not usually talk directly to things like tables. In fact, in English, just about the only kind of nouns that are second-person is a small group of pronouns that can be seen in the table below.
Sometimes, a person's name is used in the second person, but that's usually just with a baby. For example, instead of saying "you sit here", one could say "Charlie sits here".
Effect on verbs.
In English grammar, people do not usually have to do anything special to the verb if they use a second-person noun as a subject. In fact, the verb "be" is the only verb that has a special form for the second person: "are". In other languages such as French though, verbs change in different ways to match the subject. In this table, "tu" and "vous" are the second-person pronouns. We can see how the verb "parler" (talk) changes when people use them.

Buchanan Field Airport is an airport in Contra Costa County, California, United States. It is 27 nautical miles (50 km) northeast of San Francisco International Airport. The airport has a control tower and a lot of general aviation traffic. More than 500 aircraft are based on the field (mostly single-engine).
History.
In 1942, Contra Costa County paid $88,000 for land to build an airport in the county. The airport was being developed when World War II started. The United States Army Air Forces took over the land. The Army added more land and built the airport. They also built a training base for pilots. The base was called Concord Army Airfeld.
In 1946, the War Assets Administration (WAA) gave the airport back to the County. In August 1946, the airport name was changed to honor County Supervisor William J. Buchanan, who was a board member for more than forty years. The airport was still sometimes used by the U.S. Army to move soldiers, especially during the Korean War.
In 1977, Buchanan Field was its busiest, with 357,000 total operations. That made it the 16th busiest airport in the United States, ahead of San Francisco International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport, and LaGuardia Airport. During this time people were worried about noise from the airplanes, so in 1988 the county made a law against some kinds of airplanes flying into Buchanan Field.
Starting in the 1990s, the county started planning to build more businesses near the airport. Some of the businesses built were Sams Club, Taco Bell, Sports Authority, and Jiffy Lube. People might try to close this airport in the future. That is because people would like to use the land it is on for other things, because it is in the middle of the city of Concord with no room to grow, and because the airplane noise bothers people. The county has built a new airport in Byron in the eastern part of the county.
Accidents.
On December 23, 1985, a small plane crashed into the roof of the Macy's Department Store at nearby Sunvalley Mall. The pilot and two passengers were killed. 84 shoppers in the mall were hurt, mostly from burning fuel. Four of the shoppers died later from their injuries. The accident made more people be against the airport. Pacific Southwest Airlines delayed scheduled passenger service that had been planned to start in January 1986.
Another plane crashed on April 13, 2004, just after leaving Buchanan Field. The plane landed on a minivan on Interstate 680 in Pleasant Hill. The crash almost severed the left leg of a 12-year-old girl. The crash was the fault of a mechanic who had worked on the plane.
On December 21, 2006, another plane crashed. It was flying too low and ran into the ground. The plane hit Highway 4. It crashed between the highway and Marsh Drive. Three passengers were killed instantly, and another passenger died after surgery.
Airlines and destinations.
Flights to San Francisco started in 1969, but were stopped by 1980. On May 1, 1986, Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) started flights from Buchanan Field to Los Angeles International Airport. PSA offered several round trips each day using airplanes that had 100 seats. In 1987, USAir took over those flights after buying PSA. That year, USAir said that it was stopping most of the West Coast flights that it got from PSA. This included Concord, where flights ended in 1992.

During World War II, Norfolk Municipal Airport became important to the war effort. The United States Army Air Corps took control of the airport between 1942–1947. They made the runway longer and built two other runways. This was done to deal with a much larger number of flights and larger aircraft. The Norfolk Fighter Wing was created in August 1942. It providing air defense for the Norfolk area. The 52d Fighter Group was put at the airport after the Pearl Harbor attack in December 1941.

In 1950, control of the airport was turned over to the newly created Norfolk Port and Industrial Authority (NPIA). At that time, Norfolk Municipal Airport was one of the busiest in the nation. In 1951, the new terminal was opened.
In the 1960s, the change from propeller aircraft to jets took place. Norfolk Municipal Airport made changes with longer and stronger runways and taxiway facilities. Because of this, in 1968, the airport was the air transportation center for the entire Hampton Roads area. It name was changed to Norfolk Regional Airport. To be ready for large growth over the next three decades, NPIA created a plan that would grow the airport as it entered into the 21st century.
In 1974, the airport opened its new terminal. More land was bought so that the airport could be made larger. In 1976, the airport's name was changed to Norfolk International Airport. Federal customs facilities were added. New buildings were built to hold the fire station, maintenance depot and ATC tower. One of the problems the airport faced as it grew was dealt with by the nearby Botanical Garden. It created an buffer area between the airport and the city around it. Norfolk International Airport was surrounded by year-round beauty. It was a national role model for dealing with growing air facilities and an ecological sanctuary.
In the 1980s, many changes took place. A new general aviation facility opened. A new air cargo terminal was built as well. More areas for parking were also added. Even the name of the controlling body changed in 1988 - from Norfolk Port and Industrial Authority to Norfolk Airport Authority.
In the 1990s the air cargo terminal and parking facilities were made bigger. In 1991, Norfolk International made the concourses larger. This added 10 additional gates. It now had a total of 24 gates. A new fire station and new FAA air traffic control tower facility were also built.
Facilities and aircraft.
Norfolk International Airport covers area of . The airfield has a main runway (5-23) which is . Is also has a crosswind runway (14-32) which is . These let almost all commercial aircraft types use the airfield.
The airport plans to destroy the crosswind runway and build a second runway parallel to the main runway 5-23.
In 2006, the airport had 128,715 aircraft operations. It had an average of 352 per day. The breakdown of the types of flights was 44% scheduled commercial, 33% general aviation, 16% air taxi and 8% military. At that time there were 106 aircraft based at this airport. About half of these (51%) were single-engine planes. Of the rest, 30% were multi-engine, 17% jet aircraft and 2% were helicopter.
FAA Control Tower.
The FAA Norfolk Air Traffic Control Tower was built in 1995. It is high. The Federal Aviation Administration is in control of the Norfolk Tower. It deals with about 1,100 aircraft each day.
Cargo.
Norfolk International Airport (NIA) has one of the most modern and efficient air cargo facilities in the state of Virginia. About 70 million pounds of air cargo are moved in and out of the Airport each year. The airport is used by many companies with airlines that only move cargo. These include Airborne Express, FedEx, United Parcel Service and the U.S. Postal Service. NIA's two air cargo terminals have of space. An adjacent aircraft ramp gives access from planes to the warehouses.
Passenger services.
Ground transportation.
There are no bus services to and from Norfolk International Airport. The closest bus stop is away.
All ground transportation services are in the arrivals terminal. There are several rental car companies in the terminal and Taxis are usually found at the main entrance.
Parking.
A nine-floor long-term parking garage is next to the arrivals terminal. It was opened in July 2002. The garage has 2,800 parking spaces.

A major histocompatibility complex, or MHC, is a molecule on the outside of immune cells such as white blood cells. It is coded for by a large gene family in all vertebrates.
The function of is MHC molecules to sense foreign antigens, and hence the presence of 'foreign' proteins. They bind peptide fragments from pathogens onto their cell surface. Once there, the fragments are recognized by T-cells. Adaptive immunity depends on this reaction.
Effectiveness.
Two properties of MHC molecules make it difficult for pathogens to dodge the immune response.
1. MHC is polygenic. There are several different genes, so that each person or animal has a set of MHC molecules which bind somewhat different ranges of peptides.
2. The MHC genes are highly polymorphic. This means there are multiple variants alleles of each gene in the population. The polymorphism is so high that in a mixed population there are no two individuals with exactly the same set of MHC genes and molecules, with the exception of identical twins.
Inside a population, the presence of many different alleles means there will almost always be an individual with a specific MHC molecule able to load the correct peptide to recognize a specific microbe. The evolution of the MHC polymorphism means that a population will not succumb to a new pathogen or a mutated one, because at least some individuals will be able to develop an adequate immune response to defeat the pathogen. The variations in the MHC molecules are the result of the inheritance of different MHC molecules.
Transplants.
Transplants are limited to those which get the least reaction from the MHC system in tests of tissue matches.
Autoimmune diseases.
An autoimmune disease occurs when the immune cells do not recognize the MHC molecules of other cells and starts attacking its own body.

Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport is an airport serving the Washington Metropolitan Area in the United States. It is commonly called BWI. The airport is in northern Anne Arundel County, Maryland. It is about south of Baltimore and northeast of Washington, DC. BWI is named after Thurgood Marshall. He is a Baltimore native and the first African American to be on the Supreme Court of the United States.
BWI is a focus city for Southwest Airlines and Cape Air. It is a hub for AirTran Airways. 21.9 million passengers traveled through BWI in 2010. July was the busiest month ever in the airport's history. BWI was the 24th busiest airport in North America in 2010. The airport was also 47th in the world in total aircraft movements in 2008.
In 2010, BWI was listed as the best airport of its size (15–25 mil. passengers) in the world by the Airports Council International. This was based on its 2009 Airport Service Quality survey. The airport also won second place for North American airports in the "Best Food and Beverage Program" of the 2010 Richard A. Griesbach Excellence in Airport Concessions Contest.
History.
The planning to build a new airport on to serve the Baltimore/Washington area began just after World War II. Construction began in 1947. The airport was first named Friendship International Airport after the Friendship Methodist Church which was next to the land used to build the airport until 1948. The airport was opened on June 24, 1950, by President Harry Truman. In April 1957, the airport had 52 weekday departures. Eastern, Capital, American, National, TWA, United, 2 Delta and Allegheny flew through BWI at that time. The early Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s could not use Washington National, and Dulles was not built until 1962, so Baltimore became Washington's jet airport. It dealt with flights across the continent.
The State of Maryland bought Friendship International Airport from Baltimore for $36 million in 1972. The Maryland State Aviation Administration took control of the airfield. To get more passengers from the Washington area, the airport was renamed Baltimore/Washington International Airport in 1973.
The BWI Rail Station opened in 1980. It gave a rail connection to passengers on the Northeast Corridor though Amtrak. BWI became the first airport in the United States to be served by a major rail station. The station had easy access to Washington, D.C. This is something that Washington Dulles International Airport still does not have. In 1997, a new international terminal (Concourse E) was added. Dulles still deals with most of the region's international flights. Air Jamaica and British Airways have used BWI for many years. AerLingus, Air Aruba, Air Greenland, El Al, Ghana Airways, Icelandair, KLM, Ladeco, and Mexicana have used BWI in the past. Military flights by the U.S. Air Force's Air Mobility Command still use BWI.
Beginning in the 1980s and for much of the 1990s, BWI was a major hub for Piedmont Airlines and US Airways. Financial problems because of the dot-com bust, the September 11 attacks, and competition which lowered ticket prices caused them to be less active at the airport. Southwest Airlines' began using the airport in September 1993. Southwest is now the airport's largest carrier. It had 56.76% of the passengers carried in 2008. Southwest recently bought AirTran. Because of this, Southwest Holdings now has an average of 214 departures each day. BWI is now Southwest's 3rd largest destination. BWI has International flights to London, Mexico, Canada, and the Caribbean and domestic flights throughout the United States.

Sarah Burke (September 3, 1982 – January 19, 2012) was a Canadian athlete who competed in freestyle skiing and was a pioneer of the superpipe event. During her career, she won four Winter X Games gold medals and world championship in the halfpipe in 2005. She lobbied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to add the event added to the Olympic program for the 2014 Winter Olympics and was successful after trying to add it to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Burke was considered a medal favourite in the event. In 2006, she was voted #91 on the FHM-U.S.'s 100 Sexiest Women list. She married freeskier Rory Bushfield in Pemberton, British Columbia on September 25, 2010.
On January 10, 2012, She was seriously injured while she was training on the Park City Mountain Resort Eagle superpipe in Park City, Utah. Witnesses reported that she completed a trick very well but fell on her head, and that the accident did not appear to be very severe. However, she later went into cardiac arrest while she was still on the ski slope which made her chance of survival extremely low. She was resuscitated and was airlifted to the University of Utah Hospital in Salt Lake City, where she was reported to have been placed in an induced coma. The next day, she underwent neurosurgery to repair a tear in a vertebral artery. She would later succumb to her injuries on January 19, 2012.

Social liberalism also known as left liberalism in Germany, modern liberalism in the United States and new liberalism in the United Kingdom, is a political philosophy and variety of liberalism that endorses a regulated market economy and the expansion of civil and political rights. Under social liberalism, the common good is viewed as harmonious with the freedom of the individual. 
Social liberalism is different from classical liberalism: it thinks the state should address economic and social issues. Examples of problems the state might work on include unemployment, health care, and education. For example, there was no state support for general education in Britain before about 1870. Support for poor people came from private charities, and the church.
A commitment to a fair distribution of wealth and power led gradually (over about a century) to support public services as ways of fairly distributing wealth. Democracy improved by increasing the franchise (the right to vote) to all adults. Some countries which did not have democracy now do have it.
According to social liberalism, the government should also expand civil rights. Under social liberalism, the good of the community is viewed as harmonious with the freedom of the individual. Many parts of the capitalist world have used social liberal policies, especially after World War II.
John Rawls's published a book called "A Theory of Justice" in 1971, he suggested that ‘new liberalism’ is focused upon developing a theory of social justice. This idea of liberalism leads to issues of sharing, equality, and fairness in social and political circumstances. It is controversial because it attacks neoliberalism.
Social liberal ideas and parties tend to be considered centrist or centre-left.

LaGuardia Airport () is an airport in the northern part of the New York City borough of Queens. The airport is on the edge of Flushing Bay and Bowery Bay. It borders the neighborhoods of Astoria, Jackson Heights and East Elmhurst.
La Guardia is popular because of its location near to Manhattan. Although the airport is small in size, wide-body airliners once flew there often. The McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 were designed for use at LaGuardia. The Boeing 767-400ER is the largest airliner that once flew to LGA; from 2000 to 2005, Delta used the 764 with 285 seats. Today, there are usually no widebody flights. Delta Air Lines does use a Boeing 767-300 at times for one of its Atlanta flights, and Air Canada sometimes sends their 767-300s there. On July 11, 2012, the airport became a domestic hub for Delta Air Lines. It is also a focus city for American Airlines and American Eagle.
LaGuardia is the smallest of the New York metropolitan area's three main airports. The other two are John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in southern Queens and Newark Liberty International in Newark, New Jersey. LaGuardia is the closest of the three to Manhattan. These three airports are the largest airport system in the United States. They are the second most busy system of airports in the world by number of passengers. They are the first in the world in terms of total flight operations. In 2010, the airport had just under 24.0 million passenger. JFK had 46.5 million and Newark had 33.1 million. A total of about 104 million travelers used New York airports.
Most flights from LaGuardia go to locations inside the United States and Canada. Some flights also go to Aruba, the Bahamas, and Bermuda, which have United States Department of Homeland Security preclearance services. The airport has ICE/CPB facilities to deal with customs and immigration for international flights but they cannot deal with a large number of passengers at one time. LaGuardia is the busiest airport in the United States without any non-stop flights to and from Europe. Nonstop flights to or from LaGuardia are limited to only . This does not include flights on Saturdays and flights to Denver. Because of this most flights across the continent and international flights use JFK or Newark.
The airport was first named Glenn H. Curtiss Airport. It was named for Glenn Hammond Curtiss. It was later renamed North Beach Airport. New York City took control of the airport and named it New York Municipal Airport-LaGuardia Field. In 1953, it was named "LaGuardia Airport" for Fiorello La Guardia, the mayor of New York when the airport was built. The airport is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

Boris Godunov () is an opera by Modest Mussorgsky (1839–1881). It was the only opera that Mussorgsky finished. It is his most famous work and one of the most famous of all Russian operas. It was composed between 1868 and 1873.
What the opera is about.
The story of the opera is based on something that really happened in Russian history. The Russian people were ruled by a tsar (an emperor). The previous tsar Tsar Ivan IV was known as “Ivan the Terrible”. He was terribly cruel and the Russian people suffered badly under his rule. They were hungry, they were tortured and killed. When he died his son became Tsar, but he was mentally retarded, so a group of powerful people including Boris Godunov had to rule for him. Ivan also had another son, but he disappeared. He was almost certainly murdered, and Boris Godunov, who wanted to become tsar himself, had probably ordered him to be murdered (for the sake of the opera, Mussorgsky assumes that he was indeed guilty of his murder). Then he persuaded the Russian people that they should choose him to be their tsar.
Some years later a young monk escapes from his monastery and pretends to be the murdered son of Ivan the Terrible. He gets a Polish army to help him to fight Boris Godunov. Boris Godunov feels terribly guilty about the murder. He suffers so much that he dies. The young monk arrives in Moscow and makes himself tsar (Tsar Dimitri II). The ordinary Russian people remain desperately poor. It is their fate to suffer, ruled by cruel tyrants.
How the opera was composed.
The composer wrote the words (the libretto) himself. It was based on a play by Aleksandr Pushkin. Mussorgsky also read a famous book on the history of Russia: Nikolay Karamzin's "History of the Russian State" and used some of the historical material from this book.
Originally Mussorgsky composed the opera in 1869, but in those days it had to be approved by the censors before it was allowed to be performed. The opera was rejected by the censors. The main reason they gave was that there were no female characters in the opera. Mussorgsky made lots of changes, including adding a whole new act with Dimitry in love with a Polish princess. Another reason why the opera had been rejected was that composers and dramatists were not allowed to have the character of a tsar on stage. However, Tsar who then ruled said he did not mind, so the opera was first performed in 1874 in Saint Petersburg.
The opera "Boris Godunov" can either be performed in the first version of 1869, or in the second version of 1874. In fact performances of the opera have often been something of a mixture, as opera directors have often made cuts, or changes to the music or the order of scenes. The composers Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Dmitri Shostakovich have both made new editions of the opera in which they thought they could improve some of Mussorgsky’s harmony or orchestration. For many years it was these editions that were usually performed. Nowadays people realize more and more that Mussorgsky’s harmonies and orchestrations, which were very original for their time, were quite deliberate and very effective. Modern performances therefore often go back to what Mussorgsky originally wrote.
By the close of 1868, Mussorgsky had already started two operas, but never finished them These were "Salammbô" and "Marriage", which was influenced by Alexander Dargomyzhsky's opera "The Stone Guest". Mussorgsky was breaking away from the Romantic style that many composers used at the time. He had learned a lot by trying to write these operas and he used some of the musical ideas in "Boris Godunov".
Vladimir Nikolsky, a professor of Russian history, suggested to Mussorgsky the idea of writing an opera about Boris Godunov, based on Pushkin’s play. Mussorgsky worked very fast on the opera, finishing the vocal score (i.e. without the orchestration) in 9 months. During this time he was also working as a civil servant. When he state censor rejected the opera he worked another two years on it, adding a female role as required, and making other changes he felt necessary: adding three scenes, cutting one and changing another, adding songs for the Hostess, Fyodor and the Nurse. In 1873 three scenes were performed, and on 27 January 1874 the first performance of the whole opera took place. The conductor, Nápravník, was a good conductor, but he often made cuts in the operas he performed. He cut the whole of the Cell Scene because he thought the opera was too long. Nevertheless, it was a great success among many people, although some critics hated it. It was performed 21 times in Mussorgsky’s lifetime.
Famous interpreters of the main role.
During the early 20th century the Russian bass singer Fyodor Shalyapin was a very famous singer who often sang the role of Boris.
The story of the opera.
The opera is divided into a prologue and 4 acts.

In the first scene of the prologue a large crowd has come to the courtyard of a monastery. Chelkalov comes and talks to the crowd. He tells them that Boris has not yet accepted the throne, but that they should pray that he will.
The second scene is the famous coronation scene. The crowd are kneeling in front of two cathedrals in the centre of Moscow. The church bells are ringing. The boyars cross the stage. Boris has agreed to be Tsar. Boris appears on stage, but he is rather gloomy. He tells the crowd to pray for guidance.
Act I
Scene i. This takes place five years later in a monastery. An old monk, Pimen is writing the history of Russia. He has nearly finished, and he has got to the year when the Tsar’s son seems to have been murdered. He is reading what he has written to a young monk, Grigory. Grigory then has a dream. In the dream he is standing on top of a high tower and looks down on the people who are laughing at him. He feels guilty and falls from the tower. Pimen tries to comfort him. He says that Boris murdered the Tsar’s son. Grigory learns that the Tsar’s son, if he had still been alive, would have been the same age as he is now. He decides to pretend to be the Tsar’s son and to claim the throne as his.
Scene ii takes place in an inn on the border of Russia with Lithuania. The hostess sings a silly song. Two monks, Varlaam and Missail, come in. Grigory is with them. He has run away from the monastery. The two wandering monks were showing him the way to the Lithuanian border. The two monks start to get drunk and sing. Grigory does not join in, his just sits there. Two guards (like policeman) appear. They are looking for Grigory because they know that the runaway monk is a going to be a threat to the Tsar. They have a description of the wanted man. They ask whether anyone can read (hardly anyone could read in those days, except monks). Dimitri says he can read, so he takes the piece of paper and starts to read the description of the wanted man. He is describing Varlaam. Varlaam realizes this and snatches the paper from him. He decides he can read after all. He starts to read a description of Dimitri. Dimitri escapes through the window.
Act II
The scene is the Tsar’s apartments in the Kremlin in Moscow. The Tsarevich Fyodor is reading, his sister sings sadly a song about a man she loved who died before they could get married. The Nurse tries to comfort her. Fyodor tries to cheer her up by singing a jolly clapping song. The Nurse joins in. Then Boris comes in. He tells him to concentrate on his lesson. One day he will rule the country and he will need to be wise. Boris sings of his terrible feelings of doubt and agony (because he is guilty of murder). A boyar enters and tells Boris that Shuisky wants to speak to him. He warns Boris that Shuisky is on the side of the Poles who are against him. When Shuisky enters he tells Boris that a pretender has come who claims to be the Tsar’s son who is thought to have been murdered. Boris asks Shuisky whether it really was the Tsar’s son who was killed and buried. Shuisky says that it definitely was, and that he had watched over the body for five days. Boris cannot bear to hear any more and tells Shuisky to leave. He then sinks back in a chair. A clock chimes and the figures on the clock move. Boris thinks they are aghost of the murdered child. He goes mad.
Act III
The scene takes place in the royal palace in Poland. Dimitri has gone to Poland to persuade the Polish army to support him in his fight against Boris. The Poles are glad to do this because they often fought Russia when they thought they could take a bit of their land. They want the Polish Princess Marina to marry Dimitri (they think, of course, that he really is the Tsar’s son Dimitri, they don't know that he is really a young monk called Grigory). Princess Marina sings of her love for Dimitri. She has not met him yet, but she would like to be Tsarina (the wife of the Tsar) because that would bring her power. Rangoni tells Dimitri that the Princess is in love with him. A meeting is arranged in the garden. Princess Marina is horrible to him. She persuades him to act quickly to get an army together to march to Moscow and get the throne. They embrace. Rangoni is pleased, because it will be a triumph for his church.
Act IV
Scene i takes place in the palace in the Kremlin. Shuisky tells the assembled noblemen that he saw Boris who seemed to be having a mad fit. He was shouting “Away! Away!” and waving his arms. Just at that moment Boris enters doing just that. He does not seem to notice any of the boyars who are standing there. Shuisky manages to persuade him to sit down on his throne. Shuisky then says that there is a holy man outside who has something to say to everyone. The man is let in. It is Pimen. He tells a strange story. It is about a shepherd who was blind. He had a dream in which he was told to go to the tomb where the murdered Tsar’s son Dimitri lies buried. He went there and prayed. Immediately he was able to see. Boris becomes terribly distressed at this story. He calls for light, he collapses in the arms of the boyars, and he sends for his son Fyodor. Boris asks to be left alone with him. He then says goodbye to his son and tells him to take good care of the Russian people. Monks behind the scene pray for the soul of Boris. Boris dies.
Scene ii takes place in the forest of Kromy. Dimitri has marched into Russia leading his troops. The Russian people are starving and law and order has broken down. A very simple man (the Simpleton) sings a simple song. A group of children tease him and steal his money (just one kopek). Varlaam and Missail sing in praise of Dimitri. They point out two men who are Jesuits, and the people get ready to hang them. Dimitri enters and frees the Jesuits. The people rejoice because Dimitri is to be their new tsar. He tells the people to follow him to Moscow. All exit and the Simpleton is left alone on stage. He sings a simple song which expresses the sadness of the poor, hungry Russian people.
Order of the scenes in the last act.
There has been a lot of discussion about the order of the two scenes in Act IV: scene i which shows the death of Boris and scene ii which shows the Russian people in the forest. The order given above is what Mussorgsky wanted. For him, the most important thing about the opera was to express the tragedy of the Russian people who are always doomed to be ruled by cruel tyrants.
When Rimsky-Korsakov edited the opera after Mussorgsky’s death he put Boris’s death scene last. Finishing the opera with Boris’s death meant that the personal tragedy of Boris was the most important thing. Certainly, famous singers who sang the role of Boris, such as Chaliapin, liked the opera to finish with Boris’s death. Nowadays the opera is nearly always performed with the forest scene finishing the opera. This was Mussorgsky’s intention. It is about the tragedy of the people, and this is put into words by the Simpleton, who expresses the truth through his simple words.

Bioleaching is getting metals from their ores by using living organisms. This is much cleaner than the traditional method using cyanide. Bioleaching is one of several methods used to recover copper, zinc, lead, arsenic, antimony, nickel, molybdenum, gold, silver, and cobalt. 
Bioleaching uses certain types of bacteria to produce a solution called a "leachate". By leaving these bacteria with a low-grade metal ore, they can produce leachates which have a compound of that metal. Because this is in a solution it can be used in electrolysis to make the pure metal. This only produces small amounts each time, and is repeated to make it economically viable.

The Cyprus cedar ("Cedrus brevifolia") is a large coniferous member of the "cedrus" genus and is native to Cyprus where it grows in the Troödos Mountains. It is thought by some experts to be either a variety or a subspecies of the Cedar of Lebanon.

Boris Fyodorovich Godunov (, c. 1551 – ) was a famous tsar (emperor) of Russia. He ruled as a regent from about 1585 to 1598 and then as tsar from 1598 to 1605. In many ways he was a good tsar, but he had not inherited the throne. He became more and more anxious that a pretender would come who would claim to be Dmitri, the son of the previous tsar, Ivan IV (Ivan the Terrible) and try to get the throne. Dmitri had actually been murdered. The story of Boris Godunov is told in Pushkin’s play "Boris Godunov" and in Mussorgsky’s opera "Boris Godunov", but the story told by Pushkin and Mussorgsky is probably not exactly how it really happened. Both Pushkin and Mussorgsky had read a book on Russian history written by the court historian Karamzin, written in 1803. Karamzin describes Godunov as a powerful tsar who was also a weak human being, but he changed some historical facts to fit in with this theory.
From childhood to Tsardom.
Boris came from a boyar family (i.e. they belonged to the nobility). His parents were dead and he was brought up at the court of the Tsar in Moscow. The Tsar who ruled was Ivan IV, known as Ivan the Terrible who really was a very cruel ruler. He ruled for more than 50 years. Boris was very close to the royal family. One of the Tsar’s sons, Fyodor, who was not very intelligent. He married Irina, the sister of Boris. The Tsar killed his eldest son. When the Tsar died he had a son Dmitry who was only two years old. Dmitri was not allowed to become tsar, because he was the son of Ivan’s 7th marriage, and the rules of the Russian Orthodox Church were that no one should be allowed to marry more than three times (of course, no one had dared to try to stop Ivan from all those marriages). So Fyodor became Tsar Fyodor I. He was not bright enough to rule himself. We would probably say that he was mentally disabled, or that he had “learning difficulties”. Boris therefore became regent: he ruled for him. Some boyars were against Boris, but Boris somehow managed to silence them. In some ways Boris did a good job. He made Russia a safer place, fighting back the Tatars in the south and making strong contacts with Europe. He built towns and fortresses, made sure that Western Siberia was firmly under Moscow’s control, and made the head of the Muscovite Church a patriarch. In 1598 Fyodor died and Irina should have become Tsarina, but she refused and went to live in a convent. The boyars voted for Boris to become Tsar.
Boris as Tsar.
At first everything went well, but in 1601-1603 the harvest was bad and many poor people starved. The people became angry with the Tsar, because he had made very strict rules which took away the rights of the serfs (most of the poor people were serfs). There were still several royal families in Russia. They started to plot against Boris because they saw him as a threat to themselves. Boris got lots of spies to watch these families. He accused the families of treason and sent some of them to Siberia or to monasteries in the north or Russia. One of these families were the Romanovs who were later to produce a long line of tsars.
While this crisis was happening a young man called Grigory Otrepev arrived. He was a pretender. He said that he was Dmitry, Ivan’s youngest son who had been murdered in 1591. At the time people had said that it was an accident, caused by the boy’s epilepsy. But some people thought that Boris had murdered him (or ordered him to be murdered) so that he himself could become Tsar. The pretender said that he had actually escaped from the people who were trying to murder him. The pretender got lots of people on his side, including Poles and Cossacks. He marched towards Moscow. Boris’s armies tried to stop them, but then Boris died suddenly. Dmitri (as he called himself) was able to march into Moscow and (falsely) claim the throne.
A period of chaos followed in Russia with many deaths and changes of rulers. This lasted until Micael Romanov was chosen as Tsar in 1613.
What may have happened to the Tsarevich in 1591.
It is now thought that the Romanov family made up evidence to make things looks as if Boris Godunov had been guilty of the murder of Ivan’s son. Karamzin, who later wrote a history of Russia, made it look as if it were true that Boris had murdered him. When Pushkin wrote his play "Boris Godunov" he followed Karamzin’s version of the story and this is also the story as told in Mussorgsky’s opera "Boris Godunov".

Lithium hydroxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is LiOH. It contains lithium and hydroxide ions. 
Properties.
Lithium hydroxide is a white solid.It is totally white in colour. It can be anhydrous (without extra water molecules attached) or hydrated (water added to it). It dissolves in water to make a basic solution. It reacts with acids to make lithium salts. 
Preparation.
Lithium hydroxide is made by reacting lithium carbonate with calcium hydroxide. A calcium carbonate solid is made and a lithium hydroxide solution is left behind. It can also be made by reacting lithium with water or by reacting lithium oxide with water. 
Uses.
It is used in spaceships to absorb carbon dioxide. It reacts with carbon dioxide to make lithium carbonate. This prevents people from suffocating in a spaceship. Lithium hydroxide is used to make lithium greases. They are resistant to water and can be used in high or low temperatures. It is used to transfer heat. It can be used in electrolytes. It is also used to prevent corrosion in some nuclear reactors. It can be used to glaze ceramics and make cement.
Safety.
Lithium hydroxide is corrosive, like the other alkali metal hydroxides. It is also a little toxic because it has lithium in it. It can burn skin.

The pink fairy armadillo ("Chlamyphorus truncatus") or pichiciego is the smallest species of armadillo. It is found in central Argentina where it lives in dry grasslands and sandy plains. 
The armadillo's body is 84–117 mm long and its tail is 27-35 mm long. They usually weigh 85 grams. Their armor is a pale pink, and their legs are covered with little white hairs. There is not enough information to say whether it is an endangered species.
About.
The pink fairy armadillo, scientifically know as the Chlamyphorus truncatus, is the smallest living armadillo and one of the least-known burrowing mammals. They are native to central Argentina and are distinguished by their carapace consisting of hardened scales and osteoderms. Additionally, its skin and shell possess distinct features not found in other armadillos. This species exhibits predominantly subterranean behavior, which is a rare trait among burrowing mammals. This differentiation is important because it shows that they the specific skin under their shield suggests biomechanics adaptions, such as advancements in the displacement through the tunnels of sandy soils. 
In that environment, the diminutive, pink-hued creature burrows in search of insects, its primary food source. It displays remarkable excavation abilities, swiftly hiding itself from predators like foxes and owls by completely burying itself in a matter of seconds. Its carapace is multi-purposed used for protecting and shielding itself from predators, in addition to allowing it to move efficiently underground. 

The Four Stages of Cruelty is a series of four printed engravings. They were published by the English artist William Hogarth in 1751. Every print is about a different part of life of Tom Nero, a fictional (not real) character.
The "First stage of Cruelty" shows Nero, when he is a child, hurting a dog. In the "Second stage of cruelty", Nero, who is an adult, beats his horse. Then in "Cruelty in perfection", he becomes a robber and murders his pregnant lover. At last, in "The reward of cruelty", his body is taken from the gallows after his execution and is cut up into pieces by surgeons. This last annotation refers directly to the act of parliament then under consideration and passed in 1752 which changed the law to require the bodies of executed murderers to be surrendered to the surgeons for use in anatomy classes and only buried after they had been anatomized. The act was created in response to the increase in murders, especially in the suburbs of London.
William Hogarth, who had been very unhappy at the acts of cruelty that he saw on the streets of London, printed the pictures for moral learning. They were printed on cheap paper for poor people. The pictures are rougher and more violent than Hogarth's other works, which usually have touches of humor. He had felt he needed to do this to make people understand his message. However, the pictures still have the small, careful details that Hogarth is famous for.
History.
Like most of his other prints, such as "Beer Street" and "Gin Lane", Hogarth wanted "The Four Stages of Cruelty" to be a warning against cruel and evil acts, and that it was easy for a small bully to become a criminal. He wished to stop "that barbarous (mean) treatment of animals, the very sight of which renders (makes) the streets of our metropolis so distressing (terrible) to every feeling mind". Hogarth loved animals. When he painted a portrait of himself, he included his pug in the picture. He also marked the graves of his dogs and birds at his home in Chiswick.
Reception.
Hogarth was pleased with his pictures. "European Magazine" reported that he said to a person who sold books named Mr. Sewell:
In his unfinished "Apology for Painters" he added:
In his 1817 book "Shakespeare and His Times", Nathan Drake said that picture in the first plate changed the opinion of people about "throwing at cocks", and encouraged them to be firmer about stopping the people who did these things.
Some people, however, did not like the series very much. Charles Lamb said that the series were not as good as Hogarth's other works. Art historian Allan Cunningham also disliked the series:

Uncle Sam was first featured on a poster during World War I. It was used to get men and women to sign up for the army. Citizenship and duty went together with Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam is based on a real person named Samuel Wilson, who lived in Troy, New York. He owned a meat packing business with his brother. During the War of 1812, he supplied food for the American soldiers. The food barrels had a “U.S.” on them for United States. The troops knew Samuel was sending the food and called it “Uncle Sam’s.” In 1813 Uncle Sam became the nickname for the US Federal Government. People began to draw Uncle Sam in different ways. Thomas Nast was the first to popularize the image of Uncle Sam, from 1860-1870. Nast gave him a white beard and a Stars and Stripes suit. However, Uncle Sam was not yet done changing. By the early 1900s, Uncle Sam looked nothing like Samuel Wilson. In 1916, James Montgomery Flagg drew his own version of Uncle Sam. In his version Uncle Sam was wearing a tall top hat, blue jacket, and was pointing straight at the viewer. His version was put on the cover of Leslie’s Weekly with the caption “What Are You Doing For Preparedness?” In 1917 Flagg’s Uncle Sam reappeared as a poster with the caption “I Want You.” This poster was used all throughout World War I. The poster reappeared in World War II. Flagg’s illustration is now the standard for Uncle Sam. Uncle Sam has become one of the most iconic images in American politics.

Joseph Henry Blackburne (Manchester, 10 December 1841 – London, 1 September 1924), nicknamed 'The Black Death', was the leading British chess Grandmaster during the later part of the 19th century. 
Blackburne learned the game at the relatively late age of 18 but quickly became a strong player. He went on to develop a professional chess career that spanned over 50 years. At one point he was the world's second most successful player, with a string of tournament victories behind him. Blackburne especially enjoyed giving simultaneous and blindfold displays around the country. Blackburne also annotated a collection of his own games (explained the moves), and was a chess correspondent for a leading journal until his death.
Blackburne was fond of Scotch whisky, and often drank during a display. He once drank his opponent's glass, and said: "He left it "en prise", and I took it "en passant!"" Much loved, he was supported by subscriptions from his fans in his last years.

Behaviorism is an approach to study behavior based only on what can be directly seen. Behaviorists focus on relationships between stimuli and responses.
Unseen qualities such as states of mind (any condition which is significantly different from a normal waking state e.g. as a result of fear or anxiety) were not used in this type of study even though we know that the mind plays a part in all advanced animals' behaviors. Behaviorism states that behavior can be studied without knowing what the physiology of an event is, and without using theories such as that of the mind. By definition, all behavior can be observed.
Behaviorism also relied on another idea, that all human behavior was learned. Behaviorists believed that behavior could be explained by classical or operant conditioning. This is learning as a result of influences from past experiences. However, behaviorists denied the importance of inherited behaviors, instincts (inherent inclination of a living organism), or inherited tendency to behave. They did not believe, or ignored, the idea of heredity(passing of traits to offspring from parents), that something can come from a person's genes. This was the idea of the blank slate, that babies are born with a clean, empty mind. Humans, when born, are thought not to have mental experience or knowledge, and that everything is learned after they grow. The blank slate premise is opposed by modern evolutionary psychology.
Major contributors, scientists to the field of behaviorism include C. Lloyd Morgan, Ivan Pavlov, Edward Thorndike, John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner.
Pavlov researched classical conditioning through the use of dogs and their natural ability to salivate, produce water in their mouths. Thorndike and Watson rejected looking at one's own conscious thoughts and feelings ("Introspection"). They wanted to restrict psychology to experimental methods. Skinner's research leant mainly on behavior shaping using positive reinforcement (rewards rather than punishments).
Today, ideas from behaviorism are used in cognitive-behavioral therapy. Cognitive-behavioral therapy can help people deal with anxieties and phobias, as well as with certain forms of addiction.
As a scientific theory, behaviorism has largely been replaced by cognitive psychology.
Conditioning.
The act of conditioning is when a wanted behavior is made through training. This is done by matching stimuli with a specific behavior. Some behaviors are natural reflexes which people (and animals) are born with. Infants are born with inherited reflexes that help them eat, communicate, and survive. These reflexes are unconditioned, they are not taught to the baby.
Classical conditioning.
Classical conditioning (also known as Pavlovian conditioning) is when a conditioned stimulus causes an unconditioned response. This explains how people get new responses to different stimuli.
Another example of an unconditioned response is when wind is blown in a person's eyes and they blink without thinking to prevent dust or something from getting into them. This is a reflex that is innate.
Fear conditioning is when a stimulus that used to be a neutral stimulus is used to create fear. One main example is the Little Albert experiment by Watson and Rayner. The researchers tested infants' emotional reactions. They found that Little Albert would react to a loud noise and because of that he conditioned that noise to elicit fear when he saw a white rat. This came to be known as 'conditioned emotional response'. After a period of time, Little Albert would cry when he saw a white rat or anything small and white, even his stuffed animal.
Operant conditioning.
Operant conditioning is also known as instrumental conditioning. It was studied by Thorndike and Skinner.

Manganese(II) oxide is a chemical compound. It contains manganese in its +2 oxidation state. Its chemical formula is MnO. It is made by reduction of manganese(IV) oxide by hydrogen, carbon monoxide, or methane. It is also made by heating manganese carbonate.

Manganese(II) chloride is a chemical compound. It has a chemical formula of MnCl2. It is a light pink crystalline solid. It is used to make manganese carbonate and manganese(II) oxide. It is made by reacting manganese with hydrochloric acid or hydrogen chloride. It is also made when manganese(IV) oxide is reacted with hydrochloric acid; this reaction also produces chlorine.

Minardi was an automobile racing team and constructor. It was founded in 1979 by Giancarlo Minardi. It competed in the Formula One World Championship from 1985 until 2005. The team was headquartered in Faenza, Italy. They had little success, but acquiring a loyal group of fans. In 2001 the team was nearly out of money, and was about to shut down. To save the team Mr. Minardi sold it to Australian businessman Paul Stoddart. Stoddart ran the team for five years. Then Stoddart sold the team to the energy drink company Red Bull in 2005. Red Bull renamed the team Scuderia Toro Rosso.
During its time in F1, the team scored a total of 38 championship points. 16 earned by the team's first driver, Pierluigi Martini. Martini also recorded the team's only front row start, 2nd at the United States Grand Prix. Martini led a lap in the Portuguese Grand Prix. The team never achieved a podium (top 3) finish. The best finishing position they managed was 4th place. Martini finished 4th twice in and Christian Fittipaldi in .
Before Minardi's demise, it was a well-liked team within Formula One circles. In the paddock, the team was known for it friendliness, accessibility, and lack of corporate culture. On the track, their cars were considered by many as well-designed for their tiny budget. They never had the money to spend compared to front-runners such as Ferrari and McLaren. Their low running position was a result of a lack of funds and engine power, rather than a poor car. They also resisted employing pay drivers more than most other teams short on money. Pay drivers are drivers who pay the team to drive the race car. Most professional race drivers are paid by a team to drive. Minardi produced an impressive list of former drivers. Two-time World Champion Fernando Alonso drove for them in . Former Minardi drivers who have gone on to win Grands Prix include Alessandro Nannini, Giancarlo Fisichella, Jarno Trulli and Mark Webber. Alex Zanardi, who drove as a substitute driver for Minardi in , went on to win two Champ Car titles. Justin Wilson and Christian Fittipaldi have also won races in premier North American open-wheel competition.
History.
The Minardi family has a longstanding involvement in motorsport. The family has run a Fiat dealership since 1927. Giovanni Minardi competed in his own cars in the late 1940s. After his death, his son Giancarlo took over the racing part of the family business. He ran customer cars in Formula Two under various names from 1972 to 1979. Giancarlo briefly ran a customer Formula One Ferrari as Scuderia Everest in 1976. In 1979, he gaining financial backing Piero Mancini. Mancini was a well known Italian motor racing patron (supporter). This backing allowed Giancarlo to set up the Minardi racing team as a constructor.
Racing History.
Formula Two (1980–1984).
The Minardi team first competed under that name in the 1980 European Formula Two championship. The team commissioned a BMW powered design from Giacomo Caliri's FLY studios. Caliri had earler build Fittipaldi Automotive team's F5A Formula One car. The Minardi team had four moderately successful Formula Two seasons with a variety of young drivers, including Alessandro Nannini and Johnny Cecotto. The team's most best result was a 1981 win at the Misano Circuit by Michele Alboreto. Minardi left the Formula Two division at the end of 1984. In 1986 a modified version of their final Formula Two car was entered in two rounds of the Formula 3000 championship. Formula 3000 had replaced Formula Two in 1985 Minardi did not have any success in Formula 3000.
Minardi Formula One (1985–1993).
During 1984, Minardi made the decision to enter Formula One the next year. Caliri designed the team's prototype Formula One car. The car was intended to be used for both Formula One and the new Formula 3000 series. The car was designed to use the Alfa Romeo's V8 turbocharged engine. When engineer Carlo Chiti left Alfa Romeo, he founded Motori Moderni. Minardi became the only customer for Chiti's new V6 engine design. The engine was not ready for the start of the , so the team converted their chassis, the M185. They used a Cosworth DFV V8 engine for the first two races. The single car team was unsuccessful in its first year. They did not score any points. The new engine was underpowered. Driver Pierluigi Martini finished only two races. Martini's best was 8th place.
The team expanded to two cars for the season. They had little success competing with the Motori Moderni engine. In they started using the Cosworth engines. The team became more competitive. By had become top entrant for tyre maker Pirelli's return to Formula One. The team were moderately successful in the middle of the field through the late 1980s and early 1990s. Minardi gave a number of Italian drivers their first chance at the top level, including Alessandro Nannini, Pierluigi Martini and Gianni Morbidelli. Martini in especially tied with Minardi, driving for them three different times. He drove for them on their debut in . Scored their first point in the United States Grand Prix. Took their only front-row start at USA Grand Prix, aided by special Pirelli tyres. Led their only lap in the Portuguese Grand Prix. Martini was one of the drivers that scored Minardi F1 result of 4th place.
Minardi, Scuderia Italia and Fondmetal (1994–2000).
Through the mid-1990s the team was at the beginning of the end of the Italian Formula One constructors. It was the first team in modern times to make use of customer engines. They used Ferrari engines in . In they switched to Lamborghini V12 engines. In they went to Ford engines. As the number of small teams shrank, Minardi slipped from the mid-field towards the back of the pack. The team was short on money. In Minardi joined his team with BMS Scuderia Italia in an effort to survive. The Minardi team was then controlled by Flavio Briatore.
Gabriele Rumi was an Italian businessman and the former owner of the Fondmetal Formula One team. Rumi had been sponsoring Tyrrell. In Rumi switched his sponsorship support to Minardi. He became more interested in the team, and became the co-owner and chairman. For the season the team were forced to use 1998 specification Ford Zetec-R V10 engines, which were renamed as Fondmetal engines. Rumi had contracted cancer, and was forced to withdraw his backing in 2000. The team scored very few points in this era. Only seven points were scored, four of them by Martini. Michele Alboreto scored his last point in Formula One with a sixth place in the Monaco Grand Prix. Pedro Lamy scored his one and only point in Formula One with a sixth place in the Australian Grand Prix.
European Minardi (2001–2005).
The team, near financial collapse, was purchased by Australian businessman Paul Stoddart in early 2001. Stoddaart merged the team with his European Racing Formula 3000 team. During its final years, the Minardi team was almost as famous for its politics as its racing. Stoddart was described as the Formula One teams' unofficial representative. Stoddart tried to get the costs for the teams reduced. He asked to the other car manufacturers for help. He wanted an agreement where the independent teams in Formula One would get cheaper engine deals. In return, the teams that benefited from this deal would support the factory teams with the FIA. This would help the factory teams oppose new rule changes, such as the proposed ban on traction control.
Before the start of the season, Stoddart threatened to support the ban on traction control. Later he withdrew this threat. Before the Australian Grand Prix Stoddart threatened to withdraw his cars. There were new regulation in place for 2005. He claimed that Minardi could not afford to modify their cars. Once again Stoddart ended up withdrawing his threat. Several times, Stoddart called for the resignation of Max Mosley, the FIA's President.
One of Minardi's most famous performances came at the Australian Grand Prix. It was Australian driver Mark Webber's first Formula One race. At his and Stoddart's home grand prix, Webber brought the car home in fifth place finish. He scored two World Championship points, a rare occurrence for Minardi.
Minardi was represented in by two rookies, Italian Gianmaria "Gimmi" Bruni and Hungarian Zsolt Baumgartner. During the year, they celebrated their 20th season in F1. Baumgartner scored Minardi's first point in more than two years at the United States Grand Prix. Only eight cars finished the USGP, and Baumgartner finished 8th. Baumgartner was also the first Hungarian to score a point in a World Championship F1 race.
In , Minardi's drivers were Christijan Albers and Patrick Friesacher. They scored a total of 7 points, the most since the season. All of the points came from the debacle of the United States Grand Prix. They finished fifth and sixth. Only six cars started the race. None of the cars running Michelins started the race because of tyre problems. After Friesacher sponsors stopped paying him before the German Grand Prix, he was replaced by the Jordan test driver, Robert Doornbos. This created the first ever all-Dutch driver line-up in Formula One history.
Red Bull purchase.
Paul Stoddart stated that he would sell Minardi if he could find the right buyer. Stoddart said he had 41 offers to buy the team. His conditions for a sale was the ability of a buyer to move the team forward and leave the team based in Faenza. The drinks manufacturer Red Bull already owned one Formula One team, Red Bull Racing. They decided to set up a second team. They would promote American drivers through its young driver program, the Red Bull Driver Search.
On 10 September 2005 Red Bull announced it would take control of Minardi in November and run it as their "rookie team" from .
Minardi fans worldwide immediately started an online petition to save the Minardi team name and the team's 20-year heritage. The petition was not successful and the team was renamed Scuderia Toro Rosso for the 2006 season. The team's funding from Red Bull was increased. They started using the Red Bull chassis and Ferrari engines. Their results improved, and Toro Rosso scored their first win at the Italian Grand Prix.
Racing return for Minardi.
Giancarlo Minardi and Paul Stoddart have both made use of the Minardi name in new motorsport ventures.
Giancarlo Minardi.
On 1 January 2006, Giancarlo Minardi re-acquired some rights to use the Minardi name in racing. He announced that he was licensing the Minardi name to an existing team GP Racing in the junior Euro Formula 3000 series, to be entitled 'Minardi Team by GP Racing'. The team raced with moderate success, scoring a podium in each leg of the Spa round in June 2006. For 2007, Minardi Team by GP Racing combined forces with GP2 team Piquet Sports, to form Minardi Piquet Sports. For 2008 the team is known simply as Piquet Sports.
Paul Stoddart.
In 2006, Paul Stoddart declared his intention to enter a new team called 'European Minardi F1 Team Ltd' into Formula One beginning in 2008. His application was unsuccessful, with the 12th place on the grid being awarded to Prodrive. Prodrive was unsuccessful in launching their F1 team. Stoddart turned his attentions to the U.S. based Champ Car series. On 18 December 2006, it was confirmed that he had purchased a controlling interest in the CTE Racing-HVM Champ Car team. The team would be renamed Minardi Team USA. In 2007, the team had some success. Robert Doornbos won two times and had several podium finishes. He finished third in the series, and won Rookie of the Year honors. The Champ Car series folded before the 2008 season. Stoddart's team entering the IndyCar Series under the HVM name.
Stoddart retains the right to use the Minardi name for a British-registered company.

London Bridge is a bridge over the River Thames. It is in central London, and connects the City of London with Southwark. It is between Cannon Street Railway Bridge and Tower Bridge.
On the south side of the bridge are Southwark Cathedral and London Bridge station. On the north side are the Monument to the Great Fire of London and Monument tube station.
It was previously the only bridge over the Thames downstream from Kingston until Putney Bridge opened in 1729. The current bridge opened on 17th March 1973 and is the latest in a succession of bridges to occupy the spot and claim the name.
The bridge carries part of the A3 road, which is maintained by the Greater London Authority; the bridge itself is owned and maintained by a charity overseen by the City of London Corporation.
The name London Bridge is often mistakenly applied to Tower Bridge, which is the next bridge downstream.There's also a Nursery rhyme and Folk song about London Bridge called "London Bridge is Falling Down"
History.
Roman bridge.
A bridge has existed at or near the present site over the period from the Roman occupation of the area, nearly 2,000 years ago. The first bridge across the Thames in the London area, probably a military pontoon bridge, was built of wood by the Romans on the present site around 50 AD.
Around 59 AD, a piled bridge was constructed, and the local Britons built a small trading settlement next to it—the town of Londinium. The settlement and the bridge were destroyed in a revolt led by Queen Boudicca in 60 AD. The victory was short-lived, and soon afterwards the Romans defeated the rebels and set about building a new walled town. Some of the 2nd-century Roman wall has survived to this day. The new town and bridge were built around the position of the present bridge, providing access to the south-coast ports via Stane Street (the A3 route) and Watling Street (the A2).
Medieval bridge.
The southern gatehouse, the Stone Gateway, became the scene of one of London's most notorious sights: a display of the severed heads of traitors, stuck on pikes and dipped in tar to preserve them. The head of William Wallace was the first to appear on the gate, in 1305, starting a tradition that was to continue for another 355 years. Other famous heads on pikes included those of Jack Cade in 1450, Thomas More in 1535, Bishop John Fisher in the same year, and Thomas Cromwell in 1540. In 1598 a German visitor to London counted over 30 heads on the bridge:
The practice was finally stopped in 1660.
The mediaeval bridge itself was demolished in 1831.
Modern bridge.
Until 1750 when Westminster Bridge was built, London bridge was the only structure crossing the River Thames.
The medieval bridge was replaced in 1831, but in 1967 it was dismantled and re-assembled as "London Bridge (Lake Havasu City) London Bridge" at Lake Havasu City, Arizona, now linking an island in the Colorado River with the main part of Lake Havasu City.
In 1968, the current bridge was built.
In June 2012, the bridge was highlighted on the route of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the Thames.
2017 attack.
At 22:08 BST on 3 June 2017, a van rammed multiple pedestrians on London Bridge. The incident, along with a stabbing attack in Borough Market, led to seven deaths. Three presumed terrorists were shot dead by the police.

Southwark ( ) is the main part of the inner London Borough of Southwark. It is on the Thames, south of London Bridge. It is often called just 'The Borough'. Southwark was once a separate town in Surrey, and was made part of London in 1889.
Southwark has several important buildings: Southwark Cathedral, London Bridge station and the Tate Modern art gallery. Two Roman roads met in Southwark: Watling Street and Stane Street. The area was marshy with islands in Roman times. They built the first London Bridge here.
The word 'Southwark' is pronounced "Suthuk".

Watling Street is the name of an ancient route in England. It was first used by the Ancient Britons between Canterbury and St Albans. 
Later the Romans made it one of the main Roman roads in Britain. The Romans paved the route from London to the port of Dover, and from London to St Albans. 'Street' comes from the old word for paving. Eventually, the road stretched to Caerwent in Wales on the Severn estuary, just west of Chepstow.
Its route is now covered by the A2 road from Dover to London, and the A5 road from London to Wroxeter (Roman "Viriconium", in modern Shropshire). These are major roads in England, which still exist alongside the modern motorways. 
Mancetter on Watling Street is thought to be the site of Boudica's defeat by the Romans. Later, the A5 was part of the southwestern border of the Danelaw. In the early 19th century, the course between London and the Channel was paved and became known as the Great Dover Road. At various points along the historic route, the name Watling Street is still used. JAMES STYLES

Southwark Cathedral, in Southwark, London, lies on the south bank of the River Thames close to London Bridge. 
It is the mother church of the Anglican Diocese of Southwark. It has been a place of Christian worship for over 1,000 years, but a cathedral only since 1905. The present building is mainly Gothic, from 1220 to 1420. 
The main railway line from London Bridge station to Cannon Street station passes close to the cathedral, blocking the view from the south side. Borough Market and the Hall of the Worshipful Company of Glaziers and Painters of Glass by the river are close by.
History.
Saxon and medieval.
The earliest reference to the site was in the Domesday Book survey of 1086. The 'Minster' of Southwark seems to be under the control of Bishop Odo of Bayeux (William the Conqueror's half-brother). Its early history is obscure. A Saxon minster (a teaching church) served a south Thames area. In 1106, Henry I's reign, the latter became an Augustinian Priory: Norman stonework can still be seen, and Thomas Becket preached here before departing to Canterbury, days before his murder in 1170.
Architecture.
The church is the oldest Gothic church building in London, built from 1220 to 1420. It is one of the smallest cathedrals, which is because it was not built as a cathedral, but as a Priory chapel.
Choir.
The cathedral has three choirs, The main Cathedral Choir is supported financially by the St Olave's &amp; St Saviour's Schools Foundation. They were two parochial schools set up in the 1560s, and still hold their annual services here as their 'foundation' church.

Charing Cross station might mean:

Cannon Street station is a central London railway terminus and London Underground station complex in the City of London, the financial district of London. It is built on the site of the mediaeval Steelyard, the trading base in England of the Hanseatic League. It is in Travelcard Zone 1.
Rail.
This is a terminal station approached across the River Thames by the Cannon Street Railway Bridge, with entrances from Cannon Street and Dowgate Hill. Its approach by rail is by a triangular connection to both London Bridge station and Charing Cross station. Cannon Street is one of seventeen UK railway stations managed by Network Rail.
Original structure.
The station was opened by the South Eastern Railway on 1 September 1866. The original station building had two Wren-style towers, square and high, which faced on to the River Thames. The towers supported a long iron train shed crowned by a high single arch, almost semicircular, of glass and iron. To this was joined in 1867 an Italianate style hotel and forecourt. These gave passenger facilities, as well as an impressive frontage onto the street.

St Pancras station, also known since 2007 as St Pancras International, is a central London railway terminus celebrated for its Victorian architecture.
Buildings.
The Grade I listed building stands on Euston Road between the British Library, King's Cross station and the Regent's Canal. It was opened in 1868 by the Midland Railway as its southern terminus. The company became the LMS: the London, Midland and Scottish railway. When the station opened, the arched train shed was the largest single-span roof in the world.
History.
After escaping planned demolition in the 1960s, the complex was renovated and expanded during the 2000s at a cost of £800 million. A secure terminal area was constructed for Eurostar services to continental Europe—via High Speed 1 and the Channel Tunnel—along with platforms for domestic connections to the north and south-east of England. The restored station houses fifteen platforms, a shopping centre and a bus station, in addition to London Underground services from King's Cross St. Pancras tube station. St Pancras is owned by London and Continental Railways along with the adjacent urban regeneration area known as King's Cross Central.

Doctor is an academic degree, awarded by a university or similar institution. "Doctor" may be used to refer to a person with a doctorate.
To get the degree, people need to pass a doctorate exam, or write a thesis or dissertation. The requirements vary according to the subject-matter. 
There are three levels of university qualification:
Depending on the country, there are cases where people get what is called a professional doctorate. This is mostly the case in law, and in medicine. A professional doctorate is comparable to a master's degree.
People who have a doctor's degree may use the title "doctor", though in practice it is often used only by medical doctors. Medical doctors examine, diagnose and treat patients. They can specialize in a number of medical areas, such as pediatrics, anesthesiology or cardiology, or they can work as general practice physicians.

Rubidium oxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Rb2O. It is a yellow solid. It reacts vigorously with water to produce rubidium hydroxide, a very strong base. It is made by reduction of rubidium nitrate using rubidium metal. It can also be made by reduction of rubidium hydroxide with rubidium metal. It reacts with hydrogen to disproportionate it into rubidium hydroxide and rubidium hydride.

Rubidium hydride is a chemical compound. It contains rubidium and hydride ions. Its chemical formula is RbH. It is a strong reducing agent and will react with water, air and chlorine violently. It is made by disproportionating hydrogen by reacting hydrogen with rubidium hydroxide. This process also produces rubidium oxide. It is normally made by reacting rubidium and hydrogen.

Hereford Cathedral is a church in the town of Hereford. The present building was started in 1079. Before that there were two other cathedrals. It is the seat of the Bishop of Hereford.
The most famous treasure in Hereford Cathedral is the "Mappa Mundi", a mediæval map of the world dating from the 13th century. The cathedral is a Grade I listed building.
The building of the cathedral.
The first Hereford Cathedral was a stone building from the 7th century. After about 200 years it was changed, but then it was burnt down in 1056 by Welsh and Irish soldiers. The rebuilding started in 1079 and it was finished around 1140.
Many changes have been made since that time. The cathedral originally had Norman architecture, but not much of that has survived. By the end of the 13th century most of it had been changed. The changes continued in the 14th century when the central tower was rebuilt. Many other parts were added, the last big change was the adding of the main north entrance finished in 1535. This was mostly the cathedral we see today.
Today’s cathedral.
The Norman columns and arches of the nave have some decorations. They are original, done in the early 12th century. In the south aisle of the nave there are two tombs dating from the 14th century tombs. They are for members of the clergy but we do not know who they are. There is a tomb for Sir Richard Pembridge who was a Knight of the Garter.
There is a modern rood screen, a big lantern, and a reredos (a screen or decoration behind the altar). The Lady Chapel has lancet windows (tall, narrow windows) and lots of ornaments. There is a bit of ancient ironwork in the tomb of Bishop Booth who had the porch built There is also a large Norman font. The north transept was built in the Decorated Gothic. It has the shrine of St. Thomas of Hereford. The north window has some beautiful 19th century stained glass.
The tomb of the shrine of Bishop Cantilupe is built of Purbeck marble. The south transept may be the oldest part of the cathedral. The choir (the part of the cathedral where the choir sit), has many beautiful features. There is a reredos which represents Jesus on the cross. Two pointed arches show Christ with angels and the four evangelists. There is also a very strange, old Episcopal chair.
Music.
The organ was built in 1892 by Henry Willis. It is one of the best organs he made. Organists of the past include John Bull and Samuel Sebastian Wesley. Today the organist is Geraint Bowen. There has been a choir at Hereford Cathedral from at least as far back as the 13th century. Hereford Cathedral is one of the three cathedrals which house the Three Choirs Festival. In the tower there are 10 bells. They are often called the "Grand Old Lady".
Special treasures.
The famous Hereford "Mappa Mundi" (Map of the World) dates from the 13th century. It is the largest (except for one) map from that period drawn on a single sheet of vellum. It was ignored for many years, then in 1855 it was cleaned and repaired at the British Museum. It shows the world as round, with the ocean all around it. It was nearly sold in the 1980s, but money was found to build a library where it could be hung. This is where it is now.
Another famous document is one of only four copies of the Magna Carta to survive. It is kept very carefully, and sometimes shown to the public in the library next to the Mappa Mundi.

Hungerford Bridge, often called Charing Cross Bridge, is a railway bridge. It crosses the River Thames in London from Charing Cross station across to the south, near Waterloo station.
The bridge lies between Waterloo Bridge and Westminster Bridge. It is a steel bridge with two more recent pedestrian bridges on either side. These were named the Golden Jubilee Bridges, but are really just footpaths alongside the railway bridge. Each footpath has steps and lift access.
The north end of the bridge is Charing Cross station. It is near Embankment Pier and the Victoria Embankment. The south end is near Waterloo station, County Hall, the Royal Festival Hall, and the London Eye.
The first version of the bridge was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, and opened in 1845. The bridge and the walkways have been reworked and expanded at various times.

Moveable man of action or the action figure is a character figurine.They may be made from plastic or other materials.They are often based on characters from a movie, comic book, video game, or television program. One of the most famous action figures is G.I. Joe.
History.
Before the 1960s, toys had little or no movement. The company Hasbro in 1964 came up with a new toy they called an action figure. This toy was G.I. Joe created by Stan Weston. G.I. Joe had a military look with changeable clothing and accessories ready for action. Action figures were made to give boys a toy since Barbie in 1959 was so popular with girls. Starting in the 1970s comic book superheroes were made into action figures. Marvel Comics and DC Comics began making their action figures to appeal to kids favorite superheroes.
Hasbro spent many years getting information and drawings of military weapons and vehicles for the use of their military action figures the G.I. Joes.The first African American G.I. Joe was made in the second year of the action figures. In 1967 the first female G.I. Joe was made, she was a nurse. G.I. Joe in 1985 got a cartoon TV show and in 2009 a movie was made.
Over many years Hasbro made "men of action" figures including people like: George Washington, Robert E. Lee, John F. Kennedy,Bob Hope, etc.
In the 1980s, the need for action figures got bigger with all the cartoons that started on TV. Shows like Masters of the Universe, G.I. Joe and Thundercats which got the attention of young boys and gave a need for the action figures of their favorite shows. Hasbro got the idea for the Transformers we know today from a cartoon in Japan and brought it to the United States in 1984, cartoon episodes and then action figures soon came along.
By the 1990s action figures became toys for adults as well but for the use of collecting and value. These action figures came from movies, TV,and famous people like rock stars.
From the 2000s on, and up to these days, there was a transition made into movies, where popular movies would have action figures of their own characters. And not only movies, but also musicians, athletes and other figures of importance in the media.
Today, the adult collector market for action figures is expanding with companies like McFarlane Toys, Palisades, and NECA.Companies have given numerous movie characters, musicians, and athletes their very first highly detailed figures. These are commonly intended as display pieces rather than toys; however, child-oriented lines such as the Masters of the Universe revival and Justice League Unlimited still get adult collector followings as well. Comic book are also able to get figures of their characters produced, regardless of whether or not they appeared in movies or animated cartoons. Examples of companies that produce comic figures and merchandise almost exclusively include Toy Biz and DC Direct.
Adult-action figure lines are often exclusive to specific chain stores rather than mass retail. Popular lines often have figures available exclusively through mail-in offers and comic conventions like comic con, which raises their value significantly. Ploys such as packaging "errors" and "short-packed" figures have also been used by toy companies to increase collector interest.
How they are made.
Action figures are usually made of plastic. These toys are able to move and hold different poses. Making an action figure starts with the idea and drawing. Next, wire and clay models are made. When a figure is approved, it gets molded from a plastic. Paint and fabric complete the toy.
Action figures and gender.
Action figures were made to give boys a toy like Barbie. Unlike Barbie, G.I. Joe was meant to be manly and strong which is why a military toy was made.
Like Barbie, The action figure's body shows an almost unrealistic body image for boys. Some action figures like the WWE wrestler's body on the action figure have unrealistic muscles. These body images of strong wrestlers, superhero, and G.I. Joe tell boys that they too can grow up to be big and strong, which may not always be the case.
Today there are action figures for girls too. Movie character action figures like Edward Cullen from the movie Twilight are collected by girls.

The following is a list of Formula One constructors. These are constructors which have competed or plan to compete in the FIA World Championship.
Terminology: constructors vs. teams.
In Formula One racing the terms "constructor" and "entrant" do not mean the same thing. A "constructor" builds a car or engine. An "entrant" is the person or corporate entity that enters a race. They register a car and driver with the FIA. They are responsible for making the car ready to race, and keeping the car in good condition during the race weekend. Because of the role and activity of the entrant, the term "team" is often used when talking about an entrant.
Constructors.
Under the FIA rules, "the constructor of an engine or chassis is the person (including any corporate or unincorporated body) which owns the intellectual rights to such engine or chassis." Basically, who ever builds an engine or a chassis in the constructor. The title of Formula One World Champion Constructor is given to the car "make" that scores the most points during the season. The "make" of a car includes both the chassis and engine. 
If a car's chassis and engine are made by the same entity, then the constructor is the car make. For example Ferrari makes both the chassis and the engine. So the make is Ferrari. If the chassis and engine are made by different entities, the car's make is both constructor names put together. For example McLaren builds a chassis that uses a Mercedes engine. So the make is McLaren-Mercedes. The name of the chassis constructor is always placed before the engine constructor. 
Because both engine and chassis are included in the make name, chassis run with different engines are counted as two separate makes. For example, Lotus-Ford is a make different from Lotus-BRM. Each make would be scored separately. The World Constructors' Championship title is awarded to the constructor of the "chassis" of the make that scores the most points. This list only shows chassis constructors for that reason. For more information on engines, see Formula One engines.
Teams.
Since the early 1980s, the FIA requires that Formula One entrants own the intellectual rights to the chassis that they enter. Basically, that means that teams must build their own chassis. Since this time, the terms "entrant", "constructor", and "team" now mean the same thing. Before this time, constructors were free to sell their chassis to other teams. Brabham and Lotus chassis were used by many other teams during the 1960s and 1970s. Several teams than compeated with the front-runners never built their own chassis. Rob Walker Racing Team was the most successful example. They earned the first victories in Formula One for both Cooper and Lotus. 
In those days, the concept of a "works" or "factory" team was the official team of the company producing the cars. Customer teams were entrants that purchased their cars off the shelf. In modern Formula One, the team must build their own car. The term customer only applies to engines now.
There have been some cases since the 1980s where one company built cars for another team. Lola designed and built cars for Larrousse and Scuderia Italia in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The nave is where the congregation sits in a church. It usually has long benches, called 'pews', or separate chairs.
Naves are found in humble Saxon churches, and in grand Romanesque and Gothic Christian Abbeys, Cathedrals, and Basilicas. 
The nave is the central approach to the high altar, the main body of the church. 'Nave' (Medieval Latin "navis", "ship") was probably suggested by the shape of its vaulting resembling an upside-down hull (bottom of a ship).
 The nave of a church goes from the entry hall to the chancel. It is flanked by aisles separated from the nave by an arcade. If the aisles are high and of a width comparable to the central nave, the structure is sometimes said to have three naves.

Hydrogen sulfate, also known as bisulfate, is an ion. Its chemical formula is HSO4-. It is formed as part of sulfuric acid, H2SO4.
Chemical compounds containing this ion are known as bisulfates or hydrogen sulfates. An example would be sodium bisulfate. Hydrogen sulfates are acidic. They can be used as a weaker form of acid than sulfuric acid. It is a salt of sulfuric acid. In these compounds, sulfuric acid is deprotonated once. In the sulfate ion, it is deprotonated twice. 

Potassium sulfate, also known as arcanite, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is K2SO4. It contains potassium and sulfate ions.
Properties.
It is a white crystalline solid. It dissolves in water easily. It does not dissolve in potassium hydroxide or concentrated ethanol. It can react with additional sulfuric acid to make potassium bisulfate.
Preparation.
It is made by reacting potassium hydroxide and sulfuric acid. It can also be made by reacting potassium chloride with sulfuric acid. It can also be made by reacting sulfur dioxide, oxygen, and potassium chloride with some water.
Uses.
Potassium sulphate is an important salt in everyday life. It is primarily used: 
Occurrence.
Arcanite is the mineral form of potassium sulfate. 

Ammonium sulfate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is (NH4)2SO4. It contains ammonium and sulfate ions. It is slightly acidic because ammonia is a weak base. It is made by reacting ammonia with sulfuric acid. It breaks down when heated. It is used in fertilizers to provide both sulfur and nitrogen to plants. It is banned in some parts of the Middle East because it was being used to make explosives. 
The ammoniacal nitrogen of ammonium sulfate does not leach out easily. Ammonium sulfate is an acid forming fertilizer, and hence used in neutral or alkaline soils. It rarely occurs in the ground. 

"Amor Prohibido"[p] () is a song by American singer Selena. The song was written by Selena, her brother A.B. Quintanilla III, and Pete Astudillo. It became the lead single from the album of the same name (1994). "Amor Prohibido" is about the relationship between a man and a woman. Their love is put to the test. These include problems over money, and their parents not supporting their relationship because they both come from different places. Some music reviewers believe the song is similar to the "Romeo and Juliet" story because of its theme of forbidden love.
"Amor Prohibido" became one of the most successful singles, along with "No Me Queda Más", of 1994 and 1995. It later became one of Selena's signature songs. The song won awards at the Tejano Music Awards and at the Premio Lo Nuestros in 1994 and for the next three years. "Amor Prohibido" reached number one on the U.S. Hot Latin Songs and number five on the Latin Regional Mexican Airplay charts on "Billboard".
The song helped Selena attract larger and younger audiences to her concerts because of its different sounds. Selena chose to explore Latin dance-pop music with the song. She had usually recorded Tejano sounds. Non-Mexicans also started liking Tejano music because of the new sounds in Selena's music. The music video was filmed in Joshua Tree, California. It was released on all the Spanish-language television channels in the United States and Mexico on Valentine's Day. It was later certified gold by AMPROFON, while 500,000 copies were sold in the United States. Several recording artists worldwide, including non-Hispanics, have since made cover versions of "Amor Prohibido".
Background and inspiration.
"Amor Prohibido" was written by Selena's brother, A.B. Quintanilla III. A former Selena y Los Dinos backup singer, Pete Astudillo, also helped. It was recorded at Q-Productions, a small studio label founded by Selena's father, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr. It was mixed by Brian "Red" Moore, a family friend. "Amor Prohibido" was produced and engineered by Jorge Alberto Pino and Argentine composer and arranger Bebu Silvetti. "Amor Prohibido" was prepared by Joe Ojeda, and Chris Pérez, Selena's husband.
The song was written during Selena's "Live! Tour" in 1993. It began when Selena began to hum a melody in the tour bus. Her brother and Astudillo began writing down her melody lines. They wanted to write the entire melody into a song. "Amor Prohibido" was based on Selena's grandparents, Mexican immigrants, who were not allowed to be together. Their parents, Selena's great-grandparents, had forbidden them to love each other. This was because they were different from each other. When interviewed about the song, Selena said "Amor Prohibido" meant a lot to her and her family, and that it is one of her favorite songs. "Amor Prohibido" became the most successful single, along with "No Me Queda Mas", of 1994 and 1995.
The song was officially finished after she had won a Grammy Award for "Best Mexican/American Album" for "Selena Live!" (1993). "Amor Prohibido" had a lot of airplay after it was released as a promotional single on April 13, 1994. It became one of Selena's signature songs, and a fan favorite.
Selena promoted "Amor Prohibido" during her Amor Prohibido Tour. Fans in Denver, Colorado were the first crowd to watch Selena perform "Amor Prohibido" at the start of the tour on January 28, 1994.
Composition.
"Amor Prohibido" is a Spanish-language Tejano pop song mixed with modern Latin pop and South American rhythms. It is set in common time with a moderate beat tempo of 90 beats per minute. 
"Amor Prohibido" describes a relationship between a man and a woman. The song's message tells listeners to stick with their partner, no matter what may happen, even if their parents forbid them to love each other. Music critics have compared it to the story of "Romeo and Juliet" because it is also about forbidden love.
Critical reception.
"Amor Prohibido" helped Selena attract bigger crowds to her concerts. Selena also began to attract younger audiences to her music. Selena explored other Latin genres, such as Latin dance-pop with "Amor Prohibido". This new type of sound was given positive feedback by music critics. This helped other non-Mexicans to enjoy Tejano music. The song had South American rhythms and sounds. With this new type of sound, more Hispanics became fans of Selena. Most of Selena's songs were written by her brother Quintanilla III. Quintanilla III wrote most of her songs that broke free from "Tejano" and "Tex-Mex" (Texas-Mexico) music. This led Selena to be named "The Queen of Tejano music", because she was the first and only Tejano artist to ever achieve fame in different styles of music.
Selena was named the "Top Latin Artist of the '90s" and "Best selling Latin artist of the decade" by "Billboard". This was because she had fourteen top-ten singles in the "Hot Latin Songs" chart, including seven number one hits. Music Choice On Demand selected several Selena music videos, including "Amor Prohibido", as a tribute which was watched in over 42 million homes nationwide in 2010. The "Daily Vault" called "Amor Prohibido" a "seamless track", which made them wonder about Selena's father, Quintanilla Jr, and called him an "over-influential" on Selena. "Amor Prohibido" became one of the most successful singles, along with "No Me Queda Más", of 1994 and 1995.
Music video.
The music video was filmed in Joshua Tree, California by Tango Productions. It was directed by Cecilia Miniucchi, who directed most of Selena's music videos. Philip Holahan filmed the video, and Clayton Halsey edited the video after it was filmed. Filming began on February 6, 1994. The music video was released on all major Spanish-language television channels in America on Valentine's Day.
The music video begins with Selena running towards an open door in the desert. This symbolizes a new relationship. She then walks outwards from a wall, which shows videos of a couple who are in love. Selena begins singing the song while walking in the desert, with the wind blowing her hair around. She sings of how much she really wants to hear her boyfriend speak. The video then changes scenes to Selena at the open door dancing and singing along with the song. After Selena spins around once, she is seen looking out from a window, seeing herself and her boyfriend dancing. She tells him that their love should not be about money and that they should not worry about what their parents had told them. More love scenes are shown with Selena and her boyfriend laughing and enjoying each other's company. After telling him that their love should be based on how much they love each other, Selena looks at her reflection in a small puddle. While looking out from the window, Selena tells her boyfriend that she is poor and that her love is all she can give to him. The video ends with Selena and her boyfriend running away from the world and going into a new one together.

A Canon in a church is an official. They may or may not be a priest. The Chapter of a cathedral is an official group made up of the Dean and Chapter of canons, who meet in a chapterhouse. They run the cathedral, especially the business affairs of the cathedral. They are the body which has legal responsibility for the cathedral, and for electing the (arch)bishop.
Originally, a canon was a cleric who lived in the precinct of the cathedral. The word meant a priest who was under (ruled by) a bishop.
In the Anglican church, some canons are laypersons (not ordained). The title is also given to some senior or retired priests as an honorary title.

A dean is the title of a high official in a church or college. 
At one time all ancient colleges were entirely run by priests. In England, you could not even be a student unless you were a member of a Church of England congregation. In those days, a Dean was a senior person who looked after the people and finance, and that is usually so today. But now there are two kinds of Dean:

Manipuri dance, originally known as Manipuri Rasa Leela Dance is a classical dance form originated from the Manipuri culture of the Indian state of Manipur. The classical style of the dance is described as being the most graceful of all the Indian classical dances. Rabindranath Tagore used the style for his female characters in his famous dance dramas.
Manipur shares a border with Burma. The people of Manipur are part of the Mongoloid group, with a very rich and artistic culture.
Description.
The "Rasalila" of Manipur is said to be one of the highlights of India culture. It is through the Rasalila that the people of Manipur reach the highest bliss of worship. Following the "Srimadbhagavata", the core text of Chaitanite Vaishnavism, the first "Rasalila Maharas" was composed in 1779. The story as laid down in the Bhagavata was performed in the temple. A "Rasamandali", a circular dance area, was built outside the temple and people sat around it to watch the "Rasalila". This still happens in the Govindaji temple beside the Palace of the Kings. The success of this "Rasalila" made Raja Bhagyachandra (ruler from 1755 to 1789) try composing other Rasalilas such as the "Vasantarasa" and "Kunjarasa". The "Nityaras" and "Divarasa" are later developments of the Rasalila. The performances of the "Maharasa", "Vasantarasa" and "Kunjarasa" are fixed in the year, but "Nityarasa" can be performed at anytime of the year. Later kings continued to develop and compose dances. Raja Gambhir Singh (1781–1833) introduced acting the stories of child Krishna in Goparasa and Udukhalrasa. The time of Raja Chandrakirti (1831–1886) can claim to be the golden age of the evolution of Manipuri dance.
Other dances of Manipur are performed during festivals like "Rathayatra", "Holi", and "Kwakjatra". All these dances are about religious devotion. The songs that are sung with these dances speak of the glory of Radha &amp; Krishna. The main instruments are the Pung and flute.
Technique.
The technique of Manipuri dance is probably the most graceful of all the classical dances of India. The body follows the path of 8 and the feet movements generate light touch on the ground. The face has a subdued expression while the eyes mostly express the "bhaktirasa" or the emotion of devotion. There are two styles of this dance form: the "tandava" and the "lasya". In "tandava", we have the "Cholom tandava" done by men and the Krishna "tandava", which is a counterpart of the "lasya" technique in "Rasalila". The lasya is a very graceful style in Manipur. Rabindranath Tagore used this technique for the female characters in his dance dramas.
The emotional part of this dance form follows the rasa theory as written in the Vaishnava texts. The "pancharasa"- "shanta", "dasya", "sakhya", "vatsalya" and "madhura"- are the main emotions on which the Vaishnavite Manipuri Dance is based.
Manipur stands apart from all the Indian Classical dances for the beautiful costumes of the Rasalila, which is a unique creation of the people of Manipur. Religion and art have merged completely in the making of dance in Manipur. Even today one cannot identify Manipuri dance without the presence of the gods Krishna and Radha.
Development.
Lai Haraoba as a reference.
The oldest form of dance is found in the Lai Haraoba festival. The word "Lai" means God, and the word "Haraoba" means merrymaking. Lai Haraoba means merrymaking of the gods. The festival generally lasts for a month and is held every year in the months of May and June. The Maibi community holds the Lai Haraoba festival. Maibis are female priests, although there a some male priests too. There are specific rituals that the maibis follow during the festival. They dance and worship the forest gods, called the "Umang Lai". There are also household gods, for example the "Sanamahi" or "Panthoibi". All these gods are worshipped in the Lai Haraoba festival. The Maibis dance and show the formation of earth and life. They use 364 hand gestures to show this. During the festival the people of Manipur sing, dance, act, play instruments and play sports. The rituals are pre-determined and all the village people participate.
The instrument used in Lai Haraoba is called the "Pena (musical instrument)". It is a very special instrument of Manipur. It is played by the "Pena Khongba", and the tune is believed to put the Lai to sleep or used to wake him up. Other tunes are also played for the dances. The story of Khuman Khamba and Moirang Thoibi are played here. The other stories have characters such as the Nongpok Ningthou and Panthoibi. These are basically love stories. The characters are often identified with the Hindu Gods Shiva and Parvati. Though mostly based on nature worship, according to the Manipuri scholars, this festival has elements of Tantric Cults.
Martial arts as a reference.
The very popular martial art of Manipur, "Thangpak", is also a part of this festival, with performances of sword and spear play. Many movements of "Thangpak" are also part of the dances of Manipur. For example, the popular "Khujengleibi" movement in dance is found in the sword technique.
Vaishnavism.
In the 18th century, Manipur came under the influence of Chaitanite Vaishnavism which was a branch of Hinduism. Vaishnavism made its entry in Manipur during the reign of King Charairongba. During the rule of Raja Bhagyachandra, Chaitanite Vaishnavism became a permanent part of Manipur's culture. The Raja joined this religion and his subjects followed him. Many parts of daily life changed with Vaishnavism; the rituals of Vaishnavism were followed very closely by the community. The gods of the religion, Krishna and Radha were worshipped and temples were built all over Manipur. The people started worshipping the gods with dance. There were two kinds of dance that developed with the influence of this religion: the "Samkirtana" and the "Rasalila".
Samkirtana.
"Samkirtana" is basically a male dance form in which the performers play instruments, sing and dance. This follows the lines of the Samkirtana as shown by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in Bengal. In Manipur it has a very rich dance element along with singing and playing instruments. It is an energetic and acrobatic dance. The main instrument is a wooden drum, the "Pung", which looks like the clay "Khol" of Bengal. The sounds naturally vary. The dance with the "Pung", called the "Pung Cholom", is part of the "Samkirtana" in Manipur. The "Cholom" is a male dance form of Manipur. The name probably comes from the word "Chalan", meaning way of movement. There is also the "Kartal Cholom", where the movements are more grand and follow the sound and playing of the big cymbals, the "Kartalas". The singing, called the "ishei", follows the kirtana style of Bengal. Singers use a trembling tone which is typical of the Manipuri style of singing. The talas (rhythm patterns) used have an immense variety. There are 64 different talas for the Pung. These rhythmic patterns are also used in interesting combinations. The costumes are white, but the turbans vary with the instrument players. The "Samkirtana" is performed at all major occasions in the society, such as birth ceremonies, weddings, and funerals. It is even performed before the beginning of the "Rasalila".

Its skeleton is the most complete abelisaurid skeleton discovered so far. However, the skull is damaged, causing some paleontologists to speculate that it was involved in a fight shortly before it died.
In popular culture.
This dinosaur was featured in the Discovery Channel series "Dinosaur Planet", where it was depicted as a pack hunter and ate the sauropod "Saltasaurus". In the episode, the head injury discovered in the type specimen was interpreted as being crushed by a stumbling "Saltasaurus".

ISO 21482 is a standard that specifies a warning symbol to warn against the dangers of radiation. The warning is made of the trefoil on the top, which warns against radiations. There are lines towards the bottom. On the bottom left, there is a skull, which warns against poison. On the bottom right, there is a running figure, and an arrow pointing outside the sign. The color red was chosen because children said it expresses danger better than yellow. The Gallup Organization recommended the symbol, after showing it to 1650 people. 
The new symbol does not replace the old one, but it amends it. It was designed to show the danger of radiation to people who do not know about radiation, or who do not know the symbol for it. The symbol was developed because of nuclear accidents that happened because people opened containers with radioactive materials, such as the Goiânia accident in 1987, or the Samut Prakan disaster near Bangkok in 2000. The new symbol will not be placed on the containers. Rather, it will directly placed on the substances emitting radiation, of the highest categories, 1 to 3. Containers will continue to bear only the old symbol, as they do not pose a direct risk. This also applies to rooms with radiation sources or x-ray equipment in them.

Hanja is the Korean word for Chinese characters. It is about the Chinese characters that are borrowed from the Chinese language and used in the Korean language with Korean pronunciation. "Hanja-mal" or "hanja-eo" is about words which can be written with hanja. "Hanmun" (��) is about the Chinese Classical writing, but "hanja" can sometimes be used to generally mean "hanmun" too. Hanja was never very changed, so almost all of the Chinese characters in hanja are the same as in traditional Chinese. Only a few hanja characters are unique to Korea.
In the 1440s, however, a Korean hangul alphabet relying on sound was made by a group of students, led by King Sejong the Great. It was not widely used at first. However, by the early 19th and 20th century it was more widely used than "hanja", and it is now the official writing system of Korea.
But until then, everyone mostly read and wrote in "hanja", so most of the older books in Korean literature are written in hanja. Students who learn Korean history learn hanja to read historical papers. Children in South Korea still learn hanja, for many South Korean words still have roots in hanja. In North Korea, however, hanja has been abolished along with many Chinese loanwords, and North Koreans only use hangul to write in Korean.

Fumigation is the making of toxic fumes. It may be done for several reasons. The most common use is to kill insects that hide in various places in a house or other building. There are a few steps to fumigate. First, the house or room is sealed. Then the fumigant (substance making fumes) is placed in the area. Then the fumigant is left to flow through the area. Finally, the fumigant is released before the people move back in. The gases are very toxic and the person fumigating has to make sure no one goes into the fumigation area or they might get poisoned.

Constitutional economics is a program of joint study of economics and constitutionalism. It is often described as "the economic analysis of constitutional law." Constitutional economics tries to explain the selection of constitutional rules "limiting the choices and activities of economic and political agencies." This is different from the approach of traditional economics. Also, constitutional economics studies how well economic decisions of the state agree with the existing constitutional economic rights of its citizens." For example, proper distribution of economic and financial resources of the state is a big question for every nation. Constitutional economics tries bringing together constitutional economic rights of the citizens and economic policy of the state.
Origins.
The term “constitutional economics” was created in 1982 by the U.S. economist Richard McKenzie. Then it was used by another American economist – James M. Buchanan – as a name for a new academic sub-discipline. Buchanan’s work brought him in 1986 the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his "development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political decision-making."
Buchanan rejects "any organic conception of the state" as superior in wisdom, to the citizens of this state." This philosophical position forms the basis of constitutional economics. Buchanan believes that every constitution is created for at least several generations of citizens. Therefore, it must be able to balance interests of the state, society, and each individual.
There exists an important opinion that constitutional economics can be regarded as the modern "science of legislation."
The constantly growing public interest in constitutional economics has already brought to life several academic journals, for example, "Constitutional Political Economy" (established in 1990).
Judicial interpretation.
The U.S. judge Richard Posner stresses the important role of state constitution in the economic development. He asserts that "effective protection of basic economic rights promotes economic growth."
The Supreme Court of India used practical interpretation of the Indian Constitution to protect the poorest and most oppressed groups of the population in several cases of public interest litigation. This is an example of real life application of the methodology of constitutional economics.
Importance for transitional and developing countries.
Constitutional economics pays special attention to such topic as proper national wealth distribution. Many countries with changing or developing economic systems still regard their constitutions as abstract legal documents having nothing in common with actual economic policy of the state. Three quarters of all independent states are still living under nearly absolute state control of the national economy. Neither civil society nor individual citizens in these states have any influence on the decisions taken in the process of national wealth distribution. Therefore, constitutional economics is especially important for the countries whose political and economic systems are in transition and where the state rarely respects constitutional economic rights of its citizens.

Kijiji ( ; , Swahili for "village") is a centralized network of online groups of people for writing local online classified advertisements. It is a subsidiary of eBay launched in March 2005. Kijiji is currently available for more than 300 cities in Germany. Further Kijiji countries are France, Italy, Canada, China, India, Taiwan, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, and Japan. Kijiji was made available to selected cities in the United States on June 29, 2007, under the name of "eBay Classifieds".
Kijiji offers similar services and is seen as a competitor to Craigslist with the biggest exception being that Kijiji has quite an extensive pets section. Kijiji's owner eBay is also a minority shareholder in Craigslist. In April 2008 eBay launched a lawsuit against Craigslist claiming that their executives were attempting to weaken eBay's investment, while in May of the same year, Craigslist filed a countersuit claiming Kijiji had stolen trade secrets and that eBay used misleading tactics to promote the service.
Divisions.
In November 2004, eBay acquired Marktplaats.nl, which offers a similar classifieds service in the Netherlands, holding an 80% market share.
At that time, Marktplaats.nl had set out into Spain, Germany, Turkey and Canada under the name of Intoko. Intoko Spain merged with Loquo, Intoko Germany merged with Kijiji Germany and Intoko Canada merged with Kijiji Canada. Intoko Turkey transferred to the Kijiji platform and is currently operating as "intoko.kijiji.com.tr".
In May 2005, eBay bought Gumtree, which offers a similar service for cities in the UK, Ireland, Poland, Hong Kong, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the Spanish company Loquo. One month later, it acquired OpusForum.org, another website offering online classifieds in Germany. In July 2006, Klaus Gapp, the founder of OpusForum, noted that, after its acquisition, it had "merged with its new Kijiji classifieds business in the German speaking markets of Austria, Germany and Switzerland." In August 2008, Kijiji re-branded their India site to Quikr.com.
The Kijiji Germany website has changed its name to eBay Kleinanzeigen.
In March 2010, eBay unveiled a new classifieds site, called eBay Classifieds, to replace its old site, Kijiji, in the United States.

Christopher Murray-Paul Huhne, commonly known as Chris Huhne (born 2 July 1954) is a British politician. He was born in London and was a member of the Liberal Democrats until 2013.
In the 1980s he tried in vain to become an MP on behalf of the Social Democratic Party. He was the Member of Parliament for Eastleigh from May 2005 until February 2013. He was the United Kingdom's Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change from May 2010 until February 2012. When he was in that job, he decided on the most efficient ways of having electricity and other important resources in Britain. There was an article in the newspaper that said Huhne wanted to have more nuclear power stations. A lot of people think this is wrong.
Huhne was married to Greek economist Vicky Pryce (born 1952) from 1984 until they separated in 2010 and divorced in 2011. Huhne and Pryce had three children together.

Shays' Rebellion was a rebellion in central and western Massachusetts (mainly Springfield) from 1786 to 1787. The rebellion is named after Daniel Shays, a veteran of the American Revolution who led the rebels, also known as "Shaysites" or "Regulators". Most of the rebels were poor farmers angered by their debt and taxes. They could not pay their taxes and were afraid of going to jail or having their homes taken away from them.
They tried to stop the courts from taking property from indebted farmers by forcing the closure of courts in western Massachusetts. The participants in Shays' Rebellion believed they were acting in the spirit of the American Revolution, modeled their tactics after the crowd activities of the 1760s and the 1770s, and used "liberty poles" and "liberty trees" to symbolize their cause. 
Shays' Rebellion started on August 29, 1786, and by January 1787, over 1000 rebels had been arrested. A militia, which had been raised as a private army, defeated an attack on the federal Springfield Armory by the main rebel force on February 3, 1787.
Shays' Rebellion produced fears that the American Revolution’s democratic impulse had gotten out of hand. Over time, the farmers grew into armies, controlled by Shays and his men, as they tried to take back their rights.

Social Security or social welfare is the name given to programs to provide money for people who need it. Social security systems are often linked to health care.
War pensions are the most ancient type of social security. They are mentioned by Plutarch.
Universal benefits are those where everyone who meets the conditions - such as children under a certain age or people who are ill or disabled - are paid.
Contributions.
In many countries social Security provides support only to people who have paid contributions. Most pension systems are for people who have paid contributions. Contributions are regular payments taken from their pay when they are working. They will be recorded by the government. The right to a pension may include dependent members of the family. Pensions may then be paid to widows and orphans. People may also make regular payments into private pensions. 
Means test.
Means tested benefits are paid to people who can show that they are poor. There are usually tests both of regular income and of capital. They are usually paid to households. Before government schemes were started in many places charities would help people who were thought to need it. 
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights law make the "right to an adequate standard of living" one of the human rights.
France.
In France from the beginning of the 20th century employers were made to insure their workers against injury, illness, maternity, and death. After 1946 there was more done by the government. Now there are allowances for children - universal after the first child and Family Complement which is means tested. There are extra payments for adopted and disabled children and orphans. There are both contributory and means tested benefits for people over 65. 
Unemployment insurance was started in 1958. It is managed by the employers organization and the trade unions.
There is also a means tested benefit called "Revenu de solidarité active" for unemployed and underemployed workers.
Germany.
Otto von Bismarck started social security benefits in 1883. This was part of what was called State Socialism. This was the first country to do so. It included health insurance, accident insurance (workman's compensation), disability insurance and an old-age retirement pension. 
Now there is a system of unemployment benefit. People and their employers have to pay when they are working. It lasts for up to 12 months. There is also a welfare system called Hartz IV which is means-tested. This is also for working people on low pay. 
There is a state pension. The retirement age will go up to 66 by 2023. It goes by two months each year, until 2031, when the retirement age will be 67. The amount of pension is based on the pay a person had when they were working and the number of years they paid contributions.

United States.
In the United States, this refers to a program started in the New Deal. The program first gave money only to a few old people, but is now used by millions of people and is one of the largest and most costly programs in the government. The "Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance" program covers 94% of workers. State and local government workers have pension plans at the state or local level. "Retirement Insurance Benefits" are paid to people over the age of 62. The amount is increased if the person delays their claim.
Social Security in the United States is managed by the Social Security Administration, and a person in the program gets a number and has it forever, mainly because of tax reports.

Romy Schneider (September 23, 1938 - May 29, 1982) was an Austrian actress. She was from Vienna. She had German and French citizenship. She had an international career, but worked mostly in France.
Life and career.
She was born Rosemarie Albach-Retty in Vienna, Austria. Her parents were Wolf Albach-Retty (1906-1967) and Magda Schneider (1909-1996), both famous actors in Austria and Germany. 
After her parents divorced in 1945, she was raised by her mother. With her mother's help, and using her mother's family name, she started acting in 1953. She quickly became very popular through Ernst Marischka's trilogy called "Sissi", about the early life of Empress Elisabeth of Austria.
In 1958, she appeared in the movie "Christine", opposite French actor Alain Delon. They became engaged and she moved to France with him.
Schneider worked with directors such as Luchino Visconti in "Boccacio" (1961), Orson Welles in "The Trial" (1962), and Otto Preminger in "The Cardinal" (1963).
After her breakup with Delon in 1964, she went back to Germany. There she married stage director Harry Meyen. They had a son named David (1966-1981). 
She acted with Delon again in the movie "La piscine" in 1969. The rest of her career was mostly in France. Notable movies included; "Les choses de la vie" (1970), "Max et les ferrailleurs" (1971), "Le trio infernal" (1974), "Le vieux fusil" (1975), "La banquière" (1980), "La passante du Sans-Souci" (1981). 
Her later years were plagued by personal tragedies. She gave birth to a stillborn child in 1976 by her second husband Daniel Biasini. Her first husband Harry Meyen killed himself in 1979. Her son David accidentally died impaled while trying to go over a fence in 1981. That same year she had a kidney operation. 
She was found dead in her Paris apartment at the age of 43, probably from a heart attack, although no autopsy was performed. She left a daughter Sarah Biasini (born 1977, by her second husband), who is an actress.

Palm Island is a man-made island in Biscayne Bay in the city of Miami Beach, Florida, United States. Palm Island lies just south of Hibiscus Island. It is a residential area, the site of exclusive neighborhoods and multi-million dollar homes. The island is accessible via the MacArthur Causeway. 

John "Papa Johnny" Torrio, also known as "The Fox" (February 1882 – April 16, 1957) was an Italian-American mobster who helped make the criminal empire known as the Chicago Outfit in the 1920s. Torrio would later give the Chicago Outfit to Al Capone. He also thought of the National Crime Syndicate in the 1930s and later became an to the Genovese crime family.
He was shot several times in 1925. He died of a heart attack in Brooklyn in 1957.

The Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, or Lord Chancellor is a senior and important functionary in the government of the United Kingdom. He is the second highest ranking of the Great Officers of State after the Lord High Steward. The Lord Chancellor is appointed by the Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister. Before the Union there were separate Lord Chancellors of England and Scotland.
Until Tony Blair became Prime Minister the Lord Chancellor was required to be a member of the House of Lords,was its presiding officer, and was Britain's highest-ranking judge. Blair tried to abolish the position and wound up removing some of its responsibilities and dividing others, and now the holder is usually in the House of Commons. The Lord Chancellor remains responsible for the Great Seal and for the efficient functioning and independence of the courts. The current Lord Chancellor is Alex Chalk,who replaced Dominic Raab in 2023.
Formerly, there were separate Chancellors of England, Scotland and Ireland. When the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland united to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain under the Acts of Union 1707 the offices of the Chancellor of England and the Lord Chancellor of Scotland were combined to form a single office of Lord Chancellor of Great Britain for the new state.

Copiapó is a Chilean town in Region of Atacama. It was founded in December 8, 1744. It is also the capital of Region of Atacama and Province of Copiapó.

He played for the Baltimore Ravens and Carolina Panthers. Nakamura was drafted out of the University of Cincinnati by the Baltimore Ravens with the 206th pick in the sixth round of the 2008 NFL Draft and played with them from 2008 to 2011. His mother Karen was a fourth degree black belt and his father Ryozo was an eighth degree black belt. Nakamura has two brothers named Mako and Yoshi and a sister named Kimi.
On March 16, 2012, Nakamura signed a three-year contract with the Carolina Panthers. In August 2013, Nakamura suffered a concussion during a preseason game and was forced to retire afterwards. He tried to apply for the Player Retirement Plan from the NFL but was denied. Nakamura sued the insurer Lloyd’s of London for damages.

The littoral zone refers to that part of a sea, lake or river which is close to the shore. In coastal environments the littoral zone extends from the high water mark, which is rarely under water, to shoreline areas that are permanently submerged. It always includes this intertidal zone and is often used to mean the same as the intertidal zone. However, the meaning of "littoral zone" can extend well beyond the intertidal zone.
In oceanography and marine biology, the idea of the littoral zone is extended roughly to the edge of the continental shelf.

Chromium(II) chloride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CrCl2. It is a white crystalline chemical. It dissolves in water to produce a bright blue solution. It is a strong reducing agent. If the water has a little acid in it, hydrogen is produced. If the water has a little base in it, chromium(II) oxide is produced. The water needs to be very pure. 
It is made by reacting chromium(III) chloride and hydrogen at a high temperature. It can also be made by reduction of chromium(III) chloride with zinc. It is used in science research. 

Chrome may refer to:

Mount Carmel Cemetery is a Roman Catholic cemetery in the Chicago suburb of Hillside, Illinois. The cemetery is near the Eisenhower Expressway (Interstate 290) at Wolf and Roosevelt Roads. It is close to three other cemeteries. They are Queen of Heaven Cemetery, Catholic Cemetery, and Oakridge Glen Oaks Cemetery.
The cemetery is in size. There are over 226,275 people buried at Mount Carmel.
The Bishop's Mausoleum is in Mount Carmel Cemetery. It was designed by William J. Brinkmann. It is the burial place of the Bishops and Archbishops of Chicago. Cardinal Joseph Bernardin was buried there after his 1996 death. Also on the cemetery grounds are the burial places of some organized crime figures. There are over 400 family mausoleums on the cemetery grounds.
People Buried At Mt. Carmel.
Below is a short list of people buried at Mt. Carmel Cemetery.

Mercury(I) chloride, also known as calomel and mercurous chloride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Hg2Cl2. It has mercury and chloride ions in it. The mercury is in its +1 oxidation state.
Properties.
It is a white to pale yellow crystalline solid. It is toxic, but not as toxic as mercury(II) chloride because it does not dissolve in water. It turns back into mercury and mercury(II) chloride when reacted with ammonia or exposed to ultraviolet light. The black color that came from the reaction with ammonia gave its name "calomel" (beautiful black). It is a weak reducing agent. It is the most common mercury(I) compound.
Occurrence.
Calomel is sometimes found as a mineral, but it is quite rare.
Preparation.
It is made by reacting mercury with mercury(II) chloride. It can also be made by reacting mercury(I) nitrate with sources of chloride, such as sodium chloride. 
Uses.
It is used in electrochemistry as a reference electrode. Reference electrodes are used to find the electrode potentials (ability to be oxidized and reduced) of other chemical substances. Since it decomposes when light is shined on it, it is used to see how many photons are in a light beam. It was used as medicine in the past, although it was toxic.

An amalgam is a solution of a metal in mercury. It is a type of alloy. Many metals can dissolve in mercury. Amalgams are used in tooth fillings. Platinum and iron cannot form amalgams. Gold can dissolve in mercury, which is used to separate gold from its ore. Aluminum forms an amalgam which can react with water because the thin oxide coating on the aluminum is dissolved.

Mercury(II) iodide, also known as mercuric iodide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is HgI2. It has mercury and iodide ions in it. The mercury is in its +2 oxidation state.
Properties.
It is a red crystalline compound. It turns yellow when heated and turns red again when it is cooled. It is insoluble in water. It is highly toxic like all mercury compounds.
Preparation.
Mercury(II) iodide is made by reacting a mercury(II) salt such as mercury(II) chloride with a source of iodide ions. This makes a bright red precipitate.
Occurrence.
It is found as the very rare mineral coccinite.
Uses.
It was used as a medicine, but it poisoned people who took the medicine. It is also used to demonstrate how some things change color when heated and change back when cooled. It can be used to test for ammonia and as a semiconductor. 

Mercury nitrate can refer to either of the following chemical compounds:

Mercury(I) iodide, also known as mercurous iodide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Hg2I2. It has mercury and iodide ions in it. The mercury is in its +1 oxidation state.
Properties.
It is a yellow solid. When light is shined on it, it breaks down (by disproportionation) to mercury(II) iodide and iodine. It is toxic, as are all mercury compounds.
Preparation and use.
It is made by reacting mercury and iodine. It was once used as a medicine.

The Inline-four engine or Straight-four is an internal combustion engine with all four cylinders. All four cylinders are mounted in a straight line along one crankshaft. It can be powered by different types of fuels, including gasoline, diesel and natural gas.
The single bank of cylinders may be in a vertical direction (straight up), or at an angle. When the cylinders are mounted at an angle, it is sometimes called a slant-four. When listed as an abbreviation, an inline-four engine is listed either as I4 or L4 (for "longitudinal"). L4 is often used to avoid confusion between the digit 1 and the letter I.
The inline-four layout is a mechanically simple engine. It has a natural basic engine balance. It is smoother than one, two, and three cylinder engines. This makes it popular for economy cars. It does have a problem with secondary engine balance. This causes minor vibrations in smaller engines. These vibrations become worse as engine size and power increase. The more powerful engines used in larger cars use different an engine layout to avoid this problem.
Displacement.
This inline-four gasoline configuration is the most common in cars with a displacement (engine size) up to 2.4 L. Porsche used a 3.0 L four in its 944 S2 and 968 sports cars. Antique vehicles tended to have larger displacements to develop horsepower and torque. The Model A Ford was built with a 3.3 L inline-four engine.
Four-cylinder diesel engines are lower revving than gasoline engines. They often exceed 3.0 L. Toyota made a 4.1 L diesel engine that was used in the Toyota Mega Cruiser. Larger four-cylinder engines are used in industrial applications, are often made with displacements up to about 4.6 L.
Displacement can also be very small. Some cars sold in Japan have engines that are only 660 cc.
Racing use.
The 1913 Indianapolis 500 was won by Jules Goux driving a Peugeot. This car was powered by an inline-four engine designed by Ernest Henry. This design was big influence for racing engines. It was the first to use dual overhead camshafts (DOHC) and four valves per cylinder. This became the standard design for racing inline-four engines.
This Peugeot was sold to the American driver "Wild Bob" Burman. Burman broke the engine in 1915. Because of World War I, Peugeot could not deliver a new engine. Burman asked Harry Arminius Miller to build a new engine. With John Edward and Fred Offenhauser, Miller created a new engine. Its design was based on the Peugeot inline-four engine. This was the first version of the engine that would dominate the Indianapolis 500 until 1976. At first, the engine was named Miller. Later it became known as Offenhauser. The Offenhauser engines won five straight races at Indianapolis from 1971 to 1976. It was not until 1981 that engines such as the Cosworth V8 engine eliminated them.
Many cars produced for the pre-WWII voiturette Grand Prix motor racing used inline-four engine designs. These cars were rebuilt and reused after the war. They formed the beginnings of what is now Formula One.
Motorcycle use.
Modern inline-four motorcycle engines first gained their popularity with Honda's single overhead camshaft CB750 in the 1970s. The inline-four has become one of the most common engine configurations in street bikes The inline-four is common because of its relatively high performance-to-cost ratio. All of the Japanese motorcycle manufacturers offer motorcycles with inline-four engines.

Guildhall School of Music and Drama is a school for music and drama in London, England. It was founded in 1880. Students can study Music, Opera, Drama, Stage Management and Technical Theatre.
History.
The first Guildhall School was in an old warehouse, but it was soon too small. A new building was especially built and opened in 1886. Before 1935 it was known as the Guildhall School of Music. Since 1977 it has been next to the Barbican Arts Centre in the Barbican Complex.
The Guildhall School does not just teach students at the school. They also organize music examinations in the whole of Britain for anyone learning musical instruments. In 2004 these examinations joined with those of Trinity College London to form Trinity Guildhall Examinations. Today, Trinity Guildhall offers qualifications in performing and teaching in music, speech and drama, and dance to external students (students who are not studying at the school).
Today the school has a 308-seat drama and opera theatre, concert hall, lecture / recital hall and a small studio theatre. The students of the school regularly perform all over London. In 2008 work began on a large extension to the School. It will cost about £90 million.
Famous musicians who studied there include the trumpeter Alison Balsom, the composer Thomas Adès, the flautist Sir James Galway, the pianist Paul Lewis, the violinist Tasmin Little and the singers Kate Royal and Bryn Terfel.

A sodium vapor lamp is a kind of gas discharge lamp. Streetlights are a major use. There are two types; the high pressure lamp and the low pressure lamp. The older low pressure one gives yellow light. It is still used where the ability to show different colors is not very important. The newer high pressure sodium vapor light emits a broader spectrum, often appearing orange but letting people see different colors. 
These lights contain sodium metal in them. They operate by a spark through a tube that contains the sodium. The sodium emits a yellow color, which produces the light. Because the lamp contains highly flammable sodium as well as toxic mercury, it should not be placed in the trash and must be disposed of properly at the end of its life.

Aluminium oxide, also known as aluminum oxide, is a chemical compound made from aluminium and oxygen. Its chemical formula is Al2O3. It is a normally white, powdery solid. It does not exist in a particular form. It can dissolve in acids and bases. It is used as an abrasive (sandpaper is an abrasive). It comes in bauxite and corundum. It does not melt easily. It is dissolved in a cryolite melt and electrolyzed to make aluminium.
Natural occurrence.
Corundum is the most common naturally occurring crystalline form of aluminium oxide. Rubies and sapphires are types of corundum. The reason why they have different colors is because there are other elements in it.
Properties.
Al2O3 is an electrical insulator but it has a high thermal conductivity (). Aluminium oxide is insoluble in water. Its most common occurring crystalline form, called corundum or �-aluminium oxide.
Aluminium oxide is the reason why aluminium cannot corrode. When aluminium reacts with atmospheric oxygen, a thin layer of aluminium oxide (4 nm thickness) forms on any exposed aluminium surface. This layer protects the metal from more oxidation.
Aluminium oxide is an amphoteric substance, meaning it can react with both acids and bases, such as hydrofluoric acid and sodium hydroxide.

Sandpaper is a piece of paper with an abrasive glued to it. Sandpapers come in various types. Some are very rough, while others are very smooth. They are used to clean wood and metal and make them smooth. Some sandpaper is made to go on a machine that rubs very fast, while other sandpaper is used by hand.

Aluminium chloride (AlCl3), is a chemical compound. It is a white or yellow crystalline solid. It melts at a low temperature. It is made by reacting aluminium oxide with hydrochloric acid. The anhydrous (without water) form may be made by reacting aluminium and chlorine. It is used in the making of chemicals. It is also used in deodorants. It can cause slight irritation.

The starlings are a family of small to medium-sized birds, the Sturnidae. This family are passerine songbirds, whose best-known species is "Sternus", the common starling.
Starlings occur naturally in the Old World, from Europe, Asia and Africa. Species (usually the common starling) have been introduced to North America, Hawaii and New Zealand. In these new areas they compete for habitat with native birds, and are considered as invasive species.
Starlings have strong feet, their flight is strong and direct, and they are very gregarious (social). Their preferred habitat is fairly open country. They are omnivores. They eat insects and fruit. Several species live around humans. Many species search for food by opening the bill after probing it into dense vegetation; this behavior is called 'open-bill probing'. Plumage is usually dark with a metallic sheen and white flecks (spots). Most species nest in holes, laying blue or white eggs.
Many Asian species, particularly the larger ones, are called mynas, and many African species are known as glossy starlings because of their iridescent plumage.
Starlings have varied and complex songs, and may copy sounds from their surroundings, including car alarms, and human speech. The birds can recognize particular individuals by their calls.
Flocks.
North-East European starlings migrate, but in southern and western Europe the birds are resident. Starlings are generally a highly social family. Most species associate in flocks of varying sizes throughout the year. These flocks may include other species of starlings and sometimes species from other families. This social activity is obvious in their roosting behaviour. In the non-breeding season some roosts can number thousands of birds. Flocks in Britain used to number millions of birds, though numbers are now fewer than they used to be.
"Sternus vulgaris" is a highly gregarious species in autumn and winter. Flock size is variable: huge flocks are a spectacular sight and sound. These flocks often attract birds of prey such as sparrowhawks. Flocks form a tight sphere-like formation in flight, frequently expanding and contracting and changing shape, seemingly without any leader.
Very large roosts, sometimes up to 1.5 million birds, can form in city centers, woodlands, or reedbeds, causing problems with their droppings.
Huge flocks of more than a million starlings are observed just before sunset in spring in southwestern Jutland, Denmark. There they gather in March until they leave for their breeding ranges by mid-April. Their flocking creates complex shapes against the sky, a phenomenon known locally as "Black Sun". To witness this spectacle, the best place are the seaward marshlands of Tønder and Esbjerg .
Flocks of anything from five to fifty thousand starlings form in areas of the UK just before sundown during mid winter. These flocks are commonly called a murmeration, sometimes a Starling "Moot".(meaning "meeting" or "council")
North America.
Although there are approximately 200 million starlings in North America, they are all descendants of 60 birds released in 1890 (and 40 more in 1891) in Central Park, New York, by Eugene Schieffelin. He was a member of the Acclimation Society of North America, which tried to introduce to North America every bird species mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare.
As an introduced species, European starlings are not protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Starlings are considered a nuisance species in North America. The birds, which travel in enormous flocks, often pose dangers to air travel, disrupt cattle operations, chase off native birds, and roost on city blocks. They leave behind corrosive droppings and hundreds of millions of dollars of damage every year. In 2008, U.S. government agents poisoned, shot and trapped 1.7 million starlings, more than any other nuisance species.
The starling family includes a lot of birds which look different to the common starling. One large group is called the mynas, which genetic analysis shows is not a natural group.

Cryolite is a rare mineral that consists of sodium fluoride and aluminium fluoride bonded. It is used in the production of aluminium. It is first melted and then aluminium oxide is dissolved in it. Then the solution is electrolyzed. If it is immersed in water, it becomes invisible although it does not dissolve. It used to be found in large quantities in Greenland, but it has been all used up. Now it is made from fluorite artificially. 

Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is a solution of hydrogen fluoride in water. Its chemical formula is HF. It is a very dangerous acid, being very corrosive and extremely toxic. It can dissolve glass to make hexafluorosilicic acid. If it gets on the skin, it can kill you. It is made by reacting fluorite with sulfuric acid. It is used in the processing of petroleum. It is also used to make various other chemicals containing fluorine, such as teflon (the coating in a frying pan), freon (the cooling agent in an air conditioner), and fluorocarbons (used as propellants in aerosol cans). It is used to clean metals. It is very toxic because it bonds with calcium ions in the body and makes them so they cannot be used. As an acid, it can be deprotonated to produce fluorides, which are also the salts of hydrofluoric acid.
If someone gets hydrofluoric acid on them, medical attention is needed, as just small amounts are very toxic.

The New York Comic Con is a festival that takes place in New York City for fans of comics, graphic novels, anime, manga, video games, toys, movies, and television.

San Diego Comic-Con International, also known as Comic-Con International: San Diego (as given on its website), and as Comic-Con or the San Diego Comic-Con, was created in 1970 by Shel Dorf and a group of San Diegans. It was set up to celebrate comic books and for fans to meet creators, experts and other fans.

Hydrogen halides (or hydrohalic acids) are inorganic compounds that contain a hydrogen ion and a halide ion. The halogens are fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Astatine does not make a stable hydrogen halide, so it is not included.
The hydrogen halides are diatomic molecules with no tendency to ionize in the gas phase. Chemists therefore distinguish hydrogen chloride from hydrochloric acid. The former is a gas at room temperature that reacts with water to give the acid. Once the acid has formed, the diatomic molecule can not easily be regenerated.

Hydrogen bromide is a chemical compound. It dissolves in water to produce hydrobromic acid. Its chemical formula is HBr. It is a stinky colorless gas. It is used to make other bromides. It is made by reacting hot hydrogen and bromine with a catalyst. It can be made by reacting bromides with non-oxidizing acids, such as phosphoric acid. Bromine can be reduced by phosphorous acid to make hydrogen bromide. 

Seal script (Chinese: Simplified: �� ;Traditional: ��; pinyin: zhuànshū) is an ancient style of Chinese calligraphy.

The guzheng, also spelled gu zheng or gu-zheng (, with "gu" � meaning "ancient"; and also called zheng �) is a Chinese plucked zither.

A royal charter is a legal document issued by the monarchy which gives certain rights to an organization.
When an organization, for example: a university, is founded there has to be an official document which lists the basic laws (the constitution) of the organization. If this document is given to the organization by the king or queen it is called a Royal charter.
In Europe Royal charters have been used to create towns ever since the Middle Ages. The date when the charter was made is thought of as the date when the town was founded (started), even if there had been people living there many years before.
Many groups such as the British East India Company were formed by Royal charter. Most British university operate under Royal Charters. This gives them the right to give degrees to the students at the end of their studies. 
The BBC operates under a Royal Charter which lasts for a limited period of ten years, after which it is renewed.
Charities may also have Royal charters. They do not need to have one, but they are likely to be more successful if they have a Royal charter.

Sir George Grove (born Clapham in South London, 13 August 1820; died Sydenham on 28 May 1900) was an English engineer and musician. 
He wrote books about classical composers and is particularly famous for his big musical dictionary "Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians". This dictionary continued to be updated and published after his death. It has now gone through seven editions. The latest edition is available online.
Life.
George Grove was born in Clapham in South London. His father sold fish. His mother was into musicals. He learned to be an engineer and was sent out to Jamaica to help to build a lighthouse. 
He worked on the building of the Britannia tubular bridge over the Menai Strait. He married the daughter of a clergyman. He became secretary of the Society of Arts and he wrote many articles for a Dictionary of the Bible. He spent seven years doing this. It gave him the idea of doing something similar for music.
Grove went to many concerts. He bought sheet music and studied it. He wrote programme notes for concerts, writing about the music that was being played. He wrote about a lot of music by Beethoven, Schubert, Mendelssohn and Schumann. 
Career.
He wrote detailed essays about the symphonies of Beethoven and was a good friend of Clara Schumann. He travelled with the composer Arthur Sullivan to Vienna where he met many great musicians including Brahms and discovered some music by Schubert that had been forgotten. He spent several years writing his "Dictionary of Music" which was published in four volumes.
Grove worked very hard to get enough money to found the Royal College of Music which was opened in 1883 by the Prince of Wales. Grove got many great musicians to come and teach there, including the world-famous singer Jenny Lind who was already retired, and Hubert Parry, Charles Villiers Stanford and others. 
The prime minister William Gladstone gave him a knighthood for what he had done for music. The new students included many who were to become famous. 
These include Hamish MacCunn and Charles Wood. He became very fond of the student Edith Oldham and had an emotional attachment to her for the rest of his life. His wife was not interested in his work. He called his students his "children" and persuaded them to have a broad education. 
He wanted them to read a lot. He was director of the RCM for eleven years, retiring in 1894, just after the RCM moved into a new building which is situated on the south side of the Royal Albert Hall. The RCM is still there today.
George Grove was a very influential man for English music. Although he was not trained as a musician he became extremely knowledgeable and was an excellent musicologist. The RCM setup a George Grove Memorial Scholarship in his memory.

Lend-Lease was a program of the United States government put into place right before World War II. The United States was still trying to be neutral in the War, but wanted to give supplies to the Allied Powers (Great Britain, France and the Soviet Union). The U.S. gave the Allies several billion dollars of weapons. The Allies gave the United States rights to air and naval bases around the world, as well as billions in future monies. This money was not fully given until 2006. 

Teapot Dome was a political scandal that took place in 1921 to 1922. The name comes from an oil reserve near Teapot Rock, Wyoming. President Warren G. Harding let the reserve and another reserve in California, be under the control of the Department of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior, Albert Fall, who had taken $100,000 from oil companies, then let oil companies use the land. The United States Senate looked into the matter and found Fall had committed conspiracy. It is thought to be one of the biggest political scandals in American history. The scandal caused a large amount of damage to the legacy of former President Harding.
Political consequences.
1924 Presidential Election.
In 1924, Democrats tried to use Teapot Dome to their advantage in that year �s presidential election by reminding people about it. The tactic failed and Republicans handily won.

A phosphor is a chemical compound that emits light when it is exposed to light of a different wavelength (i.e. color). Phosphors do not contain the chemical element Phosphorus, which can be made to glow a different way. This sometimes causes confusion. Phosphors are used in many types of lighting, including fluorescent bulbs where they change the ultraviolet light produced by excited mercury vapor into visible light. 
The chemistry of phosphors varies greatly depending on what the phosphor is to be used for. Phosphors include 'glow in the dark' materials that can be found in novelties, toys, and emergency safety lighting for buildings. They are used in the screens of older style cathode ray tube televisions to make visible light from an electron beam. They can also be used to visibly detect ionizing radiation. Light-emitting diodes are devices that often use phosphors to obtain a particular color or color temperature.

A turbocharger, or turbo, is a gas compressor. It is used to force air into an internal combustion engine. A turbocharger is a form of forced induction. It increases the amount of air entering the engine to create more power. A turbocharger has the compressor powered by a turbine. The turbine is driven by the exhaust gas from the engine. It does not use a direct mechanical drive. This helps to improve the performance of the turbocharger.
Names.
Early builders of turbochargers called them as "turbosuperchargers". A supercharger is an air compressor used for forcing air into an engine. They thought that by adding a turbine to turn the supercharger, it would yield a "turbosupercharger". The term was soon shortened to "turbocharger". This can now create some confusion. The term "turbosupercharged" is sometimes used to refer to an engine that uses both a crankshaft-driven supercharger and an exhaust-driven turbocharger. This is also called twincharging.
Some companies such as Teledyne Continental Motors still use the term "turbosupercharger" to refer to their turbochargers.
Operation.
An engine creates power by burning a mixture of air and fuel. The air and fuel are put into the cylinders to burn. When they burn, they push the piston down. The piston turns the crankshaft and creates power. For car engines, this is measured "horsepower".
Naturally Aspirated (Normally Aspirated) engines.
An engine that does not use a turbocharger or a supercharger is called a "naturally aspirated" or "normally aspirated" engine. Normally, when engine specifications are listed, a note is only made if the engine uses a turbocharger or supercharger. Most car engines are naturally aspirated. The power they can create is limited by the amount of air the pistons can pull into the cylinders.
Turbocharged engines.
A turbocharger is a small fan pump that spins around a shaft. The pump is driven by the pressure of the exhaust gas. A turbocharger consists of a turbine and a compressor. They are both mounted on the same shaft. The turbine is a heat engine. It converts exhaust heat and pressure to rotation. This rotation is used to turn the compressor. The compressor takes in the draws in the outside air. It squeezes or compresses the air. It then sends the air to the engine. Because the air pressure has been increased, more air and fuel may be put into the cylinders. This is sometimes called "boost pressure".With more fuel to burn, the engine can create more power. This increases the "horsepower" of the engine.
Engine damage.
The engine can be damaged if the air pressure in the cylinders gets too high. If there is too much exhaust gas sent to the turbine, the compressor can create too much pressure. To stop this from happening, a "wastegate" is used. The wastegate will limit amount of exhaust gas sent to the turbine.
History.
The turbocharger was invented by Swiss engineer Alfred Büchi. His patent was applied for use in 1905. Diesel ships and locomotives with turbochargers began appearing in the 1920s.
Aviation.
During the First World War French engineer Auguste Rateau fitted turbochargers to Renault engines powering various French fighters with some success.
In 1918, General Electric engineer Sanford Moss attached a turbocharger to a "Liberty" aircraft engine. The engine was tested at Pikes Peak in Colorado at . The test was to show that the turbo could add the power airplanes lose at high altitude. Internal combustion engines lose power because at high altitude, the outside air pressure is low. Less air and fuel can be drawn into the engine.
Turbochargers were first used in production aircraft engines in the 1930s. 
Production automobiles.
The first turbocharged diesel truck was built by the "Swiss Machine Works Saurer" in 1938. The first production turbocharged automobile engines came from General Motors in 1962. The Oldsmobile Cutlass Jetfire was fitted with a turbocharger and the Chevrolet Corvair Monza Spyder with a TRW turbocharger. 
In 1974, at Paris Auto Show, Porsche displayed the 911Turbo. This was during the height of the oil crisis. The 911Turbo was the first production sports car with exhaust turbocharger and pressure regulator. The pressure regulator was the wastegate.
The first production turbo diesel automobiles were the Mercedes 300SD with a Garrett turbocharger, and the Peugeot 604. Both were introduced in 1978. Today, most automotive diesels are turbocharged.
Racing cars.
The first successful turbocharged racing engine appears to have been in 1952. Fred Agabashian in a diesel-powered Cummins Special qualified for the pole position at the Indianapolis 500. He led for . Then the turbo was damaged by tire debris. Offenhauser's turbocharged engines first came to Indianapolis in 1966. Their first victory came in 1968 using a Garrett AiResearch turbocharger. Turbocharged cars dominated the 24 Hours of Le Mans between 1976 and 1988, and then from 2000-2007.
Formula One had a "Turbo Era" from until . Engines with a capacity of 1500 cc could produce as much as 1500 hp (1119 kW). In 1977, Renault was the first to use turbocharged engines F1. The performance made up for the high cost. Other engine manufacturers started building turbos. The turbocharged engines took over the F1 field. They ended the Ford Cosworth DFV era in the mid 1980s. the FIA decided that turbochargers were making the sport too dangerous and expensive. In 1987, the FIA decided to limit the maximum boost of the turbos. In 1989, turbochargers were banned completely.
World Rally Car racers have long preferred turbocharged engines. They offer a very high power-to-weight ratios. Turbo power started to rise to the levels of F1 cars. The FIA did not ban turbos. They restrict the turbo power by limiting the inlet diameter.
Multiple turbochargers.
Parallel.
Some engines use two turbochargers. They will both be the same size. They are normally smaller than used on single-turbos engines. They are often used on V-type engines, such as V6s and V8s. Each turbo is powered by a separate exhaust pipe from the engine. Because they are smaller, they reach their optimal boost more quickly. This setup of turbos is normally called a parallel twin-turbo system. The first production car with parallel twin turbochargers was the Maserati Biturbo of the early 1980s. 
Sequential.
Some car builders avoid turbo lag (below) by using two small turbos. The normal setup is to have one turbo working all the time. The seconds turbo will only start working at higher RPM. Because the turbos are smaller, they do not have as much turbo lag. The second turbo will be able get to full speed before it is required. This setup is normally called a sequential twin-turbo. Porsche first used this technology in 1985 in the Porsche 959.
Applications.
Diesel.
Turbocharging is very common on diesel engines in automobiles, trucks, locomotives, ships, and heavy machinery. Diesels are particularly suitable for turbochargers for several reasons:
Motorcycle.
Using turbochargers to increase performance was very appealing to the Japanese builders in the 1980s. The first example of a turbocharged motorcycle is the 1978 Kawasaki Z1R TC. It used a Rayjay ATP turbo kit to build 0.35 bar (5 lb) of boost. This raised the power up from to . It was only slightly faster than the standard model. Several other motorcycles were built with turbos. Turbo applications for motorcycles increased their price. The small gains in performance were not worth the extra cost. Since the mid 1980s, no manufacturers have produced turbocharged motorcycles.
Aircraft.
A natural use of the turbocharger is with aircraft engines. As an aircraft climbs to higher altitudes, the pressure of the surrounding air quickly decreases. A turbocharger fixes this problem by compressing the air to higher pressures.
Temperature considerations.
Compressing the air increases its temperature. This causes several problems. Increased temperatures can lead to engine knock because of increased cylinder head temperatures. Hot air cannot burn as much fuel as cold air. This will decrease the power produced. 
The common method of dealing with the hotter air is to cool it. The most common way is to use an inter-cooler or after-cooler. These coolers reduce the temperature of the air before it enters the engine. 
Modern turbocharged aircraft usually do not need to cool the incoming air. Their turbochargers are generally small and the pressures created are not very high. Thus, the air temperature is not increased very much.
Comparison to supercharging.
To run a supercharger, it needs to take away some power from the engine. The power it adds is more than the power it uses. A turbocharger uses the exhaust gases. This is heat energy that would be wasted. 
Properties.
Reliability.
Turbochargers can be damaged by dirty or poor oil. Most manufacturers recommend more frequent oil changes for turbocharged engines. The turbocharger will heat when running. Many recommend letting the engine idle for several minutes before shutting the engine off. This gives the turbo time to cool down. This will increase the life of the turbo.
Turbo lag.
The time required for the turbo to build up the needed pressure is called "turbo lag". This is noticed as a hesitation in engine response. This is caused by the time taken for the exhaust system to speed up the turbine. The directly-driven compressor in a supercharger does not have this problem. 
Lag can be reduced by using lighter parts. This allows the turbine to start faster. Other mechanical changes can reduce turbo lag, but at an increase in cost.

Turmeric ("Curcuma longa") is a spice, widely used in Asian cooking. It is a rhizomatous herbaceous perennial plant, in the ginger family, Zingiberaceae.
How it grows.
Turmeric plants are widely grown in tropical areas of India, where over 70,000 acres are cultivated every year. The plant has long leaves, surrounding spikes where small flowers form. However the root, or ‘rhizome’ of the turmeric plant is harvested, in much the same way as ginger. The turmeric rhizome takes about 10 months to grow before it can be harvested; it is then boiled, cleaned and dried in the sun. Most of the harvested turmeric is ground up and sold in jars for use in cooking, however the fresh root turmeric can also be used. 
How it is used.
Turmeric is one of the main ingredients of curry powder, and is used to give it the characteristic yellow color. It is also delicious added to rice dishes, seafood, and mustards and pickles. 
Turmeric is also more widely used as a colorant for textiles and food products. It is sometimes substituted for saffron as it is much less expensive, but produces the same yellow color. Turmeric has also been used as an alternative to medicine and can be made into a drink.

Chrome alum, also known as chromium potassium sulfate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is KCr(SO4)2. It contains chromium, potassium, and sulfate ions. The chromium is in its +3 oxidation state.

 is a Japanese stage, movie, and television actor. To English-speaking audiences, he is known for playing characters such as General Tadamichi Kuribayashi in "Letters from Iwo Jima". He played Lord Katsumoto Moritsu in the 2003 movie "The Last Samurai" and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Among other awards, he has won the Japan Academy Prize for Best Actor twice, in 2007 for "Memories of Tomorrow" and in 2010 for "Shizumanu Taiyō". He is also known for his acting in Christopher Nolan's movies, "Batman Begins" and "Inception".
On February 9, 2016, it was revealed Watanabe, a leukemia survivor, had been diagnosed with stomach cancer.

Inception is a 2010 British-American science fiction action heist movie written and directed by Christopher Nolan, who also produced the movie with his wife, Emma Thomas. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. He is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased as payment for the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious. The ensemble cast includes Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Elliot Page, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine.
The idea behind "Inception" was first developed over nine years before it was released. But, there is also another anime film just like it called Paprika (2006 film). After the 2002 completion of "Insomnia", Nolan wrote an 80-page treatment for a horror movie envisioning "dream-stealers", presenting the idea to Warner Bros. based on ideas of lucid dreaming and dream incubation. 
Deciding he needed more experience before tackling a production of this magnitude and complexity, Nolan shelved the project and instead worked on 2005's "Batman Begins", 2006's "The Prestige", and "The Dark Knight" in 2008. He spent six months polishing up the script for "Inception" before Warner Bros. purchased it in February 2009. Filming spanned in six countries, beginning in Tokyo on June 19 and finishing in Canada in November 22. It was officially budgeted at $160 million, a cost which was shared between Warner Bros. and Legendary. Nolan's success with "The Dark Knight" helped gain the movie $100 million to spend on advertising.
"Inception" was first screened in London on July 8, 2010 and was shown in standard and IMAX theatres on July 16, 2010. "Inception" grossed over $828 million worldwide, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing movie of 2010. Considered one of the best movies of the 2010s, "Inception" received critical praise for its screenplay, direction, themes, action sequences, visual effects, musical score, and ensemble cast. It won four Academy Awards (Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects) and was nominated for four more: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, Best Art Direction, and Best Original Score.

Nick Jr. (sometimes disambiguated as Nick Jr. on Nickelodeon or Nick Jr. on Nick) is a programming block that aired on Nickelodeon from January 4, 1988.

The Gilded Age is a time in the in history of the USA. It lasted from the end of the American Civil War, and up to the late 19th century. It corresponds to the latter part of the British Victorian era. 
The name Gilded Age was first used by writer Mark Twain in "" (1873). The time saw rapid progress in technology and railroad expansions and industrialization. Immigrants came in the millions. The intense political partisanship of the day included disputes over currency, tariffs, political corruption and patronage, railroads and business trusts.

Thilo Sarrazin (born 12 February 1945) is a German economist and former politician of the SPD. In 2000 and 2001, Sarrazin worked for the "Deutsche Bahn". In 2002, he became the senator for finance in the German state of Berlin. In May 2009, he has become a member of the executive board of the "Deutsche Bundesbank".
Sarrazin published the book "Deutschland schafft sich ab" ("Germany Abolishes Itself") with controversial comments about the German immigration system. The book was published on 30 August 2010. His book led the executive board members of the Bundesbank to ask to dismiss Thilo Sarrazin from his office. This must be done by the German "Bundespräsident" Christian Wulff. After an agreement with the "German Bundesbank", Thilo Sarrazin will leave his post at the end of September.
Sarrazin is also known for statements such as the following:
Life.
Sarrazin was born in Gera, Germany. His father was a doctor and the mother a daughter of a West Prussian landowner. His paternal family, a French Huguenot family, is originally from Burgundy. His grandmother was English-Italian. He has explained that his name means Saracen (i.e. Muslim) and is common in Southern France. It comes from the Arab pirates that were called “Saracens” in the Middle Ages. His mother has a Polish origin. He has referred to himself as "a European mongrel".
He grew up in Recklinghausen. At age seven, he went to an orphanage in Bavaria. He graduated from the local gymnasium and then served in the military from 1967 to 1971. Then, he studied Economics at the University of Bonn, earning his doctorate. From November 1973 to December 1974 he worked for the Friedrich Ebert Foundation and became active in the SPD.
In 1975 Sarrazin started to work in the Federal Ministry of Finance. Until 1981 he served as Head of Unit in the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. In 1981, he returned to the Federal Ministry of Finance. In October 1981, he started to work as bureau chief and was a close collaborator of Federal Finance Minister Hans Matthöfer and his successor Manfred Lahnstein. Even after the end of the socialist-liberal coalition in October 1982, Sarrazin remained in the Finance Ministry. There he was director of several units, including (from 1989 to 1990) the "Innerdeutsche Beziehungen", which the German monetary, economic and social union prepared. During his time as Head of the Federal Ministry of Finance, he was partly responsible for German railways.
From 1990 to 1991, Sarrazin worked for the Treuhand. Then he was up to 1997 State Secretary in the Ministry of Finance in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Sarrazin is married to Ursula Sarrazin ("née" Breit) and has two sons.

Demonic possession is a term used to describe a situation when a demon (a devil) controls a human being. In many cultures and religions people often used to believe that a devil could enter the body of a person and control them. They often thought this was happening when a person seemed to be mad, or when they had a fit, or when they fainted. 

Malavan Bandar Anzali Football Club () is an Iranian football club based in Bandar-e Anzali, Iran.

Carbon tetrachloride, also known as carbon tet for short or tetrachloromethane, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CCl4. It contains carbon in its +4 oxidation state and chloride ions. It is a colourless heavy liquid.
Properties.
It is a colorless liquid. It smells like chloroform. It evaporates quite quickly. It can dissolve fats and oils as well as other substances including iodine. It does not burn, but it does make phosgene when heated to a very high temperature.
Preparation.
It is made by reacting methane with chlorine. This reaction is similar to the burning of methane (reaction of methane with oxygen). Hydrogen chloride, chloromethane, dichloromethane and chloroform are byproducts (left over substances). It used to be made by reacting carbon disulfide with chlorine. This reaction would produce sulfur(I) chloride.
Uses.
The uses of carbon tetrachloride have diminished lately, because it is known to be damage people's health. People think it might damage the ozone layer. Today, it is rarely used for anything.
Previously, was used in fire extinguishers. It was also used to make freon, used in dry cleaning and as a refrigerant.
Safety.
Carbon tetrachloride is very poisonous to the liver, the kidneys and the nervous system; it might also cause cancer. Carbon tetrachloride converts to phosgene (an extremely poisonous gas) at very high temperatures like fire conditions. In the days when it was used as a fire extinguisher, this problem was very common and caused deaths. 

A refrigerant is a chemical substance that is found in an air conditioner, a refrigerator, and in other refrigeration equipment. Refrigerants are chosen for the ease of converting them from liquid to vapor or vice versa, depending on their temperature and pressure. Most refrigerants in their liquid state will evaporate very fast if at atmospheric pressure. They can be classed as CFC, HCFC, HFC, HC, or HFO along with less common types.
In refrigeration equipment, a refrigerant vapor is compressed by a compressor. Compression makes it hot. It enters a condenser, where it condenses into a liquid. The refrigerant then passes through a part called a metering device, or an expansion device (there are several types of this part) where the pressure is reduced to a point where the liquid begins to boil. At this point, the refrigerant is very cold and it enters an evaporator, where it absorbs heat from the air passing over it. By the time the refrigerant leaves the evaporator, it is all a vapor again, and it goes back to the compressor where the cycle begins again. This is called the refrigeration cycle. This is one example of the use of a refrigerant, in a residential air conditioning system.
Phase out of chlorine-based refrigerants.
Older chlorine based refrigerants such as R22 have been phased out due to ozone depletion. The chlorine molecule in them was found to be depleting the ozone molecules in the atmosphere. As a result, the Montreal Protocol has been adopted. The treaty bans the production of CFCs, halons as and other ozone-depleting chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethane.

William Langland (c. 1332 – c. 1386) was an English poet. He wrote a long and complicated poem called Piers Plowman. The poem is an allegory about the difficulty of leading a good Christian life when the institution of the Church is often corrupt.
We do not know for sure that this poem was written by Langland. The strongest evidence we have is one manuscript which says that the poem was written by 'Willielmi de Langlond', son of 'Stacy de Rokayle, who died in Shipton-under-Wichwood, a tenant of the Lord Spenser in the county of Oxfordshire'. Other manuscripts also name the author as 'Robert or William langland', or 'Wilhelmus W.' (probably an abbreviation for 'William of Wichwood', since Wychwood is the village he probably came from). Another piece of evidence is within the poem itself. At one stage the narrator says: 'I have lyved in londe...my name is longe wille'. Scholars agree that this is a code for the poet's name: Longe-Land, and Wille meaning Will, short for William. This may seem unlikely, but this method of hiding the poet's name within a poem was used in Roman times, and was quite common in late-medieval literature.

Christ Church Cathedral is the cathedral of the diocese of Oxford, which includes the City of Oxford and the surrounding countryside as far north as Banbury. It is also, uniquely, the chapel of Christ Church, the largest college of the University of Oxford.
History.
The cathedral was originally the church of St Frideswide's Priory. 
In 1522, the priory was surrendered to Cardinal Wolsey, who chose it as the site for his proposed college. However, in 1529 it was taken over by King Henry VIII. Work stopped, but in June 1532 the college was refounded by the King. In 1546, Henry VIII transferred to it from Osney Abbey to the see of Oxford. The cathedral has the name of "Ecclesia Christi Cathedralis Oxoniensis", given to it by King Henry VIII's foundation charter.
Architecture.
The nave, choir, central tower, and transepts (as far as the roofs) are late Norman, and were probably erected during the lifetime of Canutus, the second prior, in the 12th century. As a whole the cathedral contains examples of the various styles from late Norman to Perpendicular.
Not the smallest.
Once this was the smallest cathedral in England. But according to their website, this has changed:
Miscellany.
Cathedral (or Christ Church) Time is traditionally five minutes behind Greenwich Mean Time. This dates back to the days before the railways when each region of the country kept to its own local time. Hence what is now called Cathedral Time is a survival of old Oxford Time.

Avebury is the site of the largest ancient monument in Great Britain. It consists of a large henge, several stone circles, stone avenues and barrows. The main henge and stone circle surrounds the village of Avebury in the English county of Wiltshire.
Avebury is one of the finest and largest Neolithic monuments in Europe, about 5,000 years old. Although older than the megalithic stages of Stonehenge to the south, the two monuments were made by people of the same culture.
At , Avebury is roughly midway between the towns of Marlborough and Calne, just off the main A4 road. Avebury is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, a World Heritage Site, and a National Trust property.
On the World Heritage list, Avebury and Stonehenge are listed together as 'Avebury, Stonehenge and Associated Sites'. However, Stonehenge is really a different site built at a different time.
Monument.
Most of the surviving structure is composed of earthworks, known as the dykes, consisting of a massive ditch and external bank henge. Although the henge is not perfectly circular, it has a diameter of about . The only known comparable sites of similar date are only a quarter of the size of Avebury. The ditch alone was 21 metres (69 ft) wide and 11 metres (36 ft) deep, with a sample from its primary fill carbon dated to 3300 - 2630 BC (4300+/-90).
Within the henge is a great outer circle. This is one of Europe's largest stone circles, with a diameter of , Britain's largest stone circle. It was either contemporary with, or built around four or five centuries after the earthworks. There were originally 98 sarsen standing stones, some weighing over 40 tons. The stones varied in height from 3.6 to 4.2 m, as exemplified at the north and south entrances. The fill from two of the stoneholes has been carbon dated to between 2900 and 2600 BC (3870+/-90, 4130+/-90)
Nearer the middle of the monument are two additional, separate stone circles. The northern inner ring is in diameter, but only two of its four standing stones remain upright. A cove of three stones stood in the middle, its entrance facing northeast. The southern inner ring was in diameter before its destruction in the eighteenth century. The remaining sections of its arc now lie beneath the village buildings. A single large monolith, high, stood in the centre along with an alignment of smaller stones.
The West Kennet Avenue, an avenue of paired stones, leads from the southeastern entrance of the henge; and traces of a second, the Beckhampton Avenue, lead out from the western entrance.
Findings of archaeological geophysics suggests that a timber circle of two concentric rings stood in the northeast sector of the outer circle. This has not yet been confirmed by excavation. A ploughed barrow is visible from the air in the northwestern quadrant.
The henge had four opposing entrances, two on a north by northwest and south by southeast line, and two on an east by northeast and west by southwest line.

The Carnac stones are the largest collection of megalithic standing stones in the world. The more than 3,000 prehistoric standing stones were cut from local rock and erected by the pre-Celtic people of Brittany.
The stones were erected at some stage during the Neolithic period, probably around 3300 BC, but some may be as old as 4500 BC. The stones occur in a number of Neolithic sites around the French village of Carnac, in Brittany. They include rows of stones (alignments), dolmens, tumuli and single menhirs.
In recent centuries, many of the sites have been neglected, with reports of dolmens being used as sheep shelters, chicken sheds or even ovens. Stones have been removed to make way for roads, or used as building materials. The management of the sites is a controversial topic.
Alignments.
There are three major groups of stone rows — "Ménec", "Kermario" and "Kerlescan" — which may have once formed a single group, but have been split up as stones were removed for other purposes.
Ménec alignments.
Eleven converging rows of menhirs stretching for . There is what may be the remains of stone circles at either end. According to the tourist office there is a "cromlech containing 71 stone blocks" at the western end and a very ruined cromlech at the eastern end. The largest stones, around high, are at the wider, western end; the stones then become as small as 0.6m high along the length of the alignment before growing in height again toward the extreme eastern end.
Kermario alignment.
This fan-like layout recurs a little further along to the east in the "Kermario" alignment. It consists of 1029 stones in ten columns, about in length. A stone circle to the east end, where the stones are shorter, was revealed by aerial photography.
Kerlescan alignments.
A smaller group of 555 stones, further to the east of the other two sites. It is composed of 13 lines with a total length of about , ranging in height from to . At the extreme west, where the stones are tallest, there is a stone circle which has 39 stones. There may also be another stone circle to the north.
Petit-Ménec alignments.
A much smaller group, further east again of Kerlescan, falling within the commune of La Trinité-sur-Mer. These are now set in woods, and most are covered with moss and ivy.
Tumuli.
There are several tumuli, mounds of earth built up over a grave. In this area, they generally feature a passage leading to a central chamber which once held neolithic artefacts.
Saint-Michel.
The tumulus of Saint-Michel was constructed between 5000 BC and 3400 BC. At its base it is , and is high. It required of stone and earth. Its function was the same as that of the pyramids of Egypt: a tomb for the members of the ruling class. It contained various funerary objects, such as 15 stone chests, pottery, jewellery, most of which are currently held by the Museum of Prehistory of Carnac. It was excavated in 1862 by René Galles with a series of vertical pits, digging down . Le Rouzic also excavated it between 1900 and 1907 discovering the tomb and the stone chests.
A chapel was built on top in 1663 but was rebuilt in 1813, before being destroyed in 1923. The current building is an identical reconstruction of the 1663 chapel, built in 1926. 
Moustoir.
Also known as "Er Mané", it is a chamber tomb long, wide, and high. It has a dolmen at the west end, and two tombs at the east end. A small menhir, approximately high, is nearby. 
Dolmens.
There are several dolmens scattered around the area. These dolmens are generally considered to have been tombs, however the acidic soil of Brittany has eroded away the bones. They were constructed with several large stones supporting a "capstone", then buried under a mound of earth. In many cases, the mound is no longer present, sometimes due to archeological excavation, and only the large stones remain, in various states of ruin.
Other formations.
There are some individual menhirs and at least one other formation which do not fit into the above categories.
"Manio" quadrilateral.
An arrangement of stones to form the perimeter of a large rectangle. Originally a "tertre tumulus" with a central mound, it is long, and aligned to east of northeast. The quadrilateral is wide to the east, but only wide at the west.
"Manio" giant.
Near the quadrilateral is a single massive menhir, now known as the "Giant". Over tall, it was re-erected around 1900 by Zacharie Le Rouzic, and overlooks the nearby Kerlescan alignment. 

Muckrakers was a term for the group of people who wrote books and newspaper articles in the United States around 1900. Most of their books were about showing how bad things were in "Gilded Age" in America. Some things they wrote about were the power of big business, unclean practices in factories, and the condition of poor people. The books the Muckrakers wrote led to changes in America during the Progressive Era, such as the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 and the breakup of the Standard Oil company.
The following people were among the Muckrakers:

An acrostic is a poem or other form of writing. In an acrostic, the first letter, syllable, or word of every line, paragraph, or other feature spells out a word or a message. It can be used to remember things. For example, Edgar Allan Poe wrote an acrostic poem in English:
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
Elizabeth it is in vain you say
"Love not" — thou sayest it in so sweet a way:
In vain those words from thee or L.E.L.
Zantippe's talents had enforced so well:
Ah! if that language from thy heart arise,
Breath it less gently forth — and veil thine eyes.
Endymion, recollect, when Luna tried
To cure his love — was cured of all beside —
His follie — pride — and passion — for he died.
&lt;/poem&gt;
The first letters of each line (E, L, I, Z, A, B, E, T, H) spell out "Elizabeth".

Celestial navigation is a method of navigation where a person figures out their location and direction using the stars in the night sky. It has been used by sailors to help them find their way in the night. They look for familiar stars or constellations, which will help them find their way. 
Celestial navigation involves comparing the angle of certain stars to other stars and how high they are above the Earth's horizon. By doing this, a person can find their longitude.

Psychiatrist Ian Stevenson, from the University of Virginia, interviewed young children who claimed to remember a past life. He did more than 2,500 interviews over a period of 40 years and wrote twelve books, including "Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation". 
Stevenson found that childhood memories possibly related to reincarnation normally occurred between the ages of three and seven years. He compared the memories with reports of people known to the deceased, attempting to do so before any contact between the child and the deceased's family had occurred. 
Some 35 per cent of the children examined by Stevenson had birthmarks or birth defects. Stevenson believed that the existence of birth marks and deformities on children, when they occurred at the location of fatal wounds in the deceased, provided the best evidence for reincarnation. However, Stevenson has never claimed that he had proved the existence of reincarnation, and cautiously referred to his cases as being "of the reincarnation type" or "suggestive of reincarnation". 
Stevenson retired in 2002, and psychiatrist Jim B. Tucker took over his work, and wrote "Life Before Life: A Scientific Investigation of Children’s Memories of Previous Lives".

Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation is a 1974 book written by psychiatrist Ian Stevenson on reincarnation research. The book focuses on twenty cases investigated by the author. It has been translated into seven foreign languages.
Reviews of "Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation" have been published in the "American Journal of Psychiatry", "British Journal of Psychiatry", "British Journal of Medical Psychology", "Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease" and some other journals.

The Monk parakeet, Quaker parrot, or Seatowerian Budgerigar (binomial name Myiopsitta monachus) is a species of parrot of the true parrots family. It lives in Argentina and the countries around South America. The bird is also known for passing one of its tail feathers through its bill to reconnect the barbules. This locking process is similar to pressing Velcro strips together.
Description.
The parakeet is on average 29 cm long, with a 48 cm wingspan, and weighs 100 g. Females tend to be 10-20% smaller, but it is hard to tell the sexes apart, unless they test the feather or blood DNA. It has bright green upperparts. The forehead and breast are pale grey. The bill is orange, and when it calls, it makes a loud and throaty "chape(-yee)" or "quak quaki quak-wi quarr". Sometimes, it also screeches, "skveet".
Domestic kinds of Monk parakeets may have different colors such as white, blue, and yellow instead of green.
As pets.
Monk parakeets are very intelligent and social birds. When they are kept as pets, they can memorize large vocabularies. They are also able to learn many words and phrases.

Jean Cocteau (Jean Maurice Eugène Clément Cocteau, 5 July 1889 – 11 October 1963) was a French artist, poet, novelist, dramatist, designer, boxing manager, playwright, moviemaker and actor.
Cocteau wrote or worked on 21 stage performances, some of which were ballets, and some were plays. Cocteau's movies, most of which he both wrote and directed, were particularly important in introducing the avant-garde into French cinema and influenced the upcoming French New Wave genre.
He also worked with Pablo Picasso on several projects and was friends with most of the European art community. In all his creative work, he was a modernist.
In 1955, Cocteau was made a member of the "Académie Française" and The Royal Academy of Belgium. During his life Cocteau was made a Commander of the "Légion d'honneur".
Life.
Cocteau was bisexual. His circle of associates, friends and lovers included Pablo Picasso, Jean Hugo, Jean Marais, Henri Bernstein, Marlene Dietrich, Coco Chanel, Erik Satie, María Félix, Édith Piaf (whom he cast in one of his one-act plays entitled "Le Bel Indifferent" in 1940), and Raymond Radiguet.
In the 1930s, Cocteau had an affair with Princess Natalie Paley, the beautiful daughter of a Romanov grand duke. She became pregnant. To Cocteau's distress and Paley's life-long regret, the foetus was aborted. Cocteau's longest-lasting relationships were with the French actors Jean Marais (who played 'tough guy' roles in movies and TV), and Édouard Dermit, whom Cocteau formally adopted. Cocteau cast Marais in four of his movies.
At times, Cocteau was addicted to opium.
Biographer James S. Williams describes Cocteau's politics as "naturally right-leaning".p123 In his diary, Cocteau accused France of disrespect towards Hitler and speculated on the Führer's sexuality. His views became known, and he was arraigned on charges of collaboration after the war. He was cleared of any wrongdoing: it turned out that he had used his contacts to try and save friends from the Nazis.p182
Cocteau died of a heart attack in Milly-la-Foret, Essonne.
Work.
Theatre and ballet.
Cocteau wrote or worked on 21 stage performances, some of which were ballets, and some were plays.
He was involved in Diaghilev's "Ballets Russes" from the first season in Paris, 1909. He wrote scenarios ("librettos") for Fokine's "Le Dieu Blue" in 1912, Massine's "Parade" in 1917 and Nijinska's "Le Train Bleu" in 1924. He also design company posters, and worked for several other ballet companies. He wrote many articles on dance, and made sketches of many in Diaghilev's circle.
In 1940, "Le Bel Indifférent", Cocteau's play written for and starring Édith Piaf, was enormously successful.
Film.
Cocteau directed eleven movies in "avant-gard" style, wrote scripts for six movies and dialogue for three, and directed the photography for one more. Some of his most well-known were "Blood of a Poet" (1930), "Les Parents terribles" (1948), and "Orpheus" (1949).
Writing.
Cocteau wrote extensively. including poetry. All of it is in French, but some is available in translation.
Cocteau wrote five novels. The most important of these was probably "Les Enfants terribles" (1929). He also published 23 books or pamphlets of original poetry, and 26 volumes of poetic criticism and collections. He illustrated 12 works of poetry. He made a number of recordings, mostly spoken poems.

Sodium azide, also known as sodium trinitride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NaN3. 
Properties.
It is a white crystalline solid. It is an explosive. It can be detonated by an electric spark. It contains sodium and azide ions. It reacts with acids to produce hydrazoic acid. It can be destroyed by reacting it with nitrous acid. This reaction produces nitric oxide, nitrogen, and sodium hydroxide. It is a powerful reducing agent, which makes it explosive. It contains nitrogen in its -1/3 oxidation state.
Preparation.
It is made by reacting ammonia with sodium to make sodium amide. The sodium amide then reacts with nitrous oxide to make sodium azide. It can also be made by reacting sodium nitrate with sodium amide. Another process is reacting sodium nitrite with hydrazine.
Uses.
It is used in airbags. It makes the airbags puff out. A computer detects that the car is crashing and ignites the sodium azide. This makes sodium metal and a lot of nitrogen gas. The nitrogen gas inflates the airbag. It can be used to make other explosives, such as lead azide. 
Safety.
Sodium azide is very toxic. It reacts with acids to make the explosive hydrazoic acid, which also is a very toxic gas. It is similar to cyanide poisoning. It attacks the respiratory system and the circulatory system.

Azide, also known as trinitride, is an ion. It is formed when hydrazoic acid is deprotonated. It is a powerful reducing agent. Its chemical formula is N3-. The most common azide is sodium azide. Many azides are explosive and very toxic. 

Sodium nitrite is a chemical compound. It contains sodium and nitrite ions. Its chemical formula is NaNO2.
Properties.
It is a white or yellowish crystalline compound. It is a strong oxidizing agent, being reduced to nitrogen. It is also a weak reducing agent, being oxidized to nitrate. It contains nitrogen in its +3 oxidation state. It is toxic in large amounts.
Occurrence.
It is found in some vegetables. It is also found in some meat in small amounts. Otherwise, it is manmade.
Uses.
It is used in meat like ham to preserve it. The nitrites are disinfecting, which helps preserve the meat. Almost all processed meat (like cold cuts, hot dogs) contains nitrites. Some people get headaches when they eat nitrites. These headaches have been named "hot dog headaches". It is used to make other chemicals and to get rid of sodium azide. It also can be used when someone is poisoned by cyanide. 
Safety.
Nitrites can form toxic chemicals when heated. These toxic chemicals are carcinogens, which means they can cause cancer. That is why some people do not want nitrites in foods. Others say that because nitrites kill bacteria, they should be included in foods. Sodium nitrite used in food is colored bright pink so it is not mistaken for salt or sugar.

Lithium nitride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Li3N. It contains lithium and nitride ions. 
Properties.
Lithium nitride is a red or purple solid. It reacts with water to make lithium hydroxide and ammonia. It is the only alkali metal nitride that is stable. It is a very strong base. It reacts with hydrogen to make lithium hydride and lithium amide. 
Preparation.
It is made by reacting lithium with nitrogen. This is unusual because almost no other elements react with nitrogen at room temperature like lithium. It can also be made by reacting nitrogen with lithium dissolved in sodium.
Uses.
It can be used to store hydrogen. It can also be used as a source of the nitride ion.
Safety.
Lithium nitride is toxic and corrosive. It releases ammonia when put in water.

Arteriosclerosis is a diseased condition of the arteries. The artery walls are thickened, hardened and lose stretchiness, called elasticity.
There are three main types:
The effects of arteriosclerosis can lead to lack of regular blood flow. Low blood flow to the brain can make you dizzy, numb, have slurred speech, and have other symptoms. Thromboses can further block the blood flow. This causes you to be at risk of getting stroke, or a heart attack.
Arteriosclerosis is a major health problem. Arteriosclerosis can be prevented by reducing risks. Risks are smoking, obesity, and low amounts of exercise. Doctors recommend dieting and exercise. Diets that are low in cholesterol and saturated fats. Some patients may take drugs that lower the amount of cholesterol in their blood.

Georges Braque (Argenteuil, 13 May 1882 – Paris, 31 August 1963) was a major 20th century French painter, collagist, printmaker and sculptor who, with Pablo Picasso, developed the art movement known as Cubism.
French art critic Louis Vauxcelles first used the term "Cubism", or "bizarre cubiques", in 1908 after seeing a picture by Braque. He described it as 'full of little cubes', after which the term quickly gained wide use. Art historian Ernst Gombrich described cubism as "the most radical attempt to stamp out ambiguity, and to enforce one reading of the picture – that of a man-made construction, a colored canvas". The Cubist movement spread quickly throughout Paris and Europe.
A major idea of Braque's was the fractured stringed instrument as a cubist model. This he painted a number of times with variations, and made sculptures with fractured violins, guitars, etc., inside transparent acrylic (perspex) blocks. Examples:

Nitric oxide also known as nitrogen monoxide is a chemical compound. It contains nitrogen in its +2 oxidation state. It contains nitrogen and oxide ions. Its chemical formula is often given as ·N=O.
Properties.
It is a colorless gas. It is easily oxidized to nitrogen dioxide by air. It can react with a mixture of air and water to make nitrous acid. It glows when reacted with ozone.
Preparation.
It is made by reacting ammonia with oxygen with a catalyst. It is also made in lightning. It can be made in small amounts by reacting copper with nitric acid. It can also be made by reducing nitrous acid with compounds such as iron(II) sulfate.
Uses.
Nitric oxide is used in making nitric acid from ammonia. Ammonia is reacted with air to make nitric oxide, and the nitric oxide is oxidized by air to make nitrogen dioxide. The nitrogen dioxide is dissolved in water to make nitric acid and more nitric oxide.
It is also used as a stimulant in the human body. It has many actions in the human body that are being studied.
Safety.
Nitric oxide is toxic when breathed in. It also easily is oxidized to nitrogen dioxide, a toxic brown choking substance.

Kansas City is the third-largest city in the U.S. state of Kansas. It is the county seat of Wyandotte County. Kansas City is a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri and is the third largest city in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area. About two million people live in this region. The city is part of the "Unified Government". This also includes the cities of Bonner Springs and Edwardsville. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 156,607. The city is at Kaw Point, which is the junction of the Missouri and Kansas rivers.
History.
Kansas City formed in 1868. It was first officially mentioned in October 1872. The Kansas-Missouri border area became the first battlefield in the conflict over slavery that led to the American Civil War. The first city election was held on October 22, 1872. It resulted in the election of Mayor James Boyle. The mayors of the city after its organization have been James Boyle, C. A. Eidemiller, A. S. Orbison, Eli Teed and Samuel McConnell. John Sheehan was appointed Marshal in 1875. He was also Chief of Police. He had the control over five policemen. In June 1880, the Governor of Kansas made the city of Kansas City a city of the second class with the Mayor Samuel McConnell present. James E. Porter was Mayor in 1910.
It was one of the 100 largest cities for many US Census counts, from 1890 to 1960, including 1920, when it had over 100,000 residents for the first time. In 1997, voters approved a proposition to unify the city and county governments.
On March 30, 2011, Internet search company Google Inc. announced that Kansas City had been selected as the site of an experimental fiber-optic network that Google will build at no cost to the city. Kansas City was chosen from a field of 1,100 US communities that had applied for the network. Google plans to have the network in operation by 2012.
Geography.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 128.3 sq mi (332.3 km2). 124.7 sq mi (323.1 km2) of it is land and 3.6 sq mi (9.2 km2) of it is water.
Cityscape.
Kansas City is organized into a system of neighborhoods, some with histories as independent cities or the sites of major events.
Neighborhoods of Kansas City, Kansas
Climate.
Kansas City is near "Tornado Alley", a region where cold air from the Rocky Mountains and Canada meets warm air from the Gulf of Mexico. This situation causes the formation of powerful storms. The most recent tornado to strike Kansas City itself was in May 2003. The region is also prone to ice storms, such as the 2002 ice storm during which hundreds of thousands lost power for days and (in some cases) weeks. The MoKan area was subject to flooding, including the Great Flood of 1993 and the Great Flood of 1951.
People.
As with Kansas City, Missouri, the percentage of the city's biggest ethnic group, non-Hispanic whites, has gone down from 76.3% in 1970 to 40.2% in 2010.
Sister cities.
Kansas City has four sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:

Nitrogen oxide may refer to any of these chemical compounds:

Dinitrogen pentoxide is a chemical compound. It is made by removing water from nitric acid. Its chemical formula is N2O5. It is a powerful oxidizing agent. It is a white solid. It is made by reacting phosphorus(V) oxide with nitric acid. The phosphorus(V) oxide removes the water from the nitric acid. It can be dissolved in chloroform to add the NO2+ group to some chemical compounds. It is toxic as it can make nitrogen dioxide gas.

Hypochlorous acid is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is HClO or HOCl. It is not stable. It contains chlorine in its +1 oxidation state. It is a powerful oxidizing agent. It is made by reacting sodium hypochlorite with an acid that cannot be oxidized, such as phosphoric acid. If the acid can be oxidized, the hypochlorous acid will be destroyed. It is used to make some chemicals. It breaks down into hydrochloric acid and oxygen in sunlight. It reacts with hydrochloric acid to make chlorine gas. It is a powerful disinfectant.

Amide can refer to two different things.
Amides in inorganic chemistry.
An amide ion is different from an amide in organic chemistry. The amide ion is made by deprotonating ammonia. This is ammonia acting as an acid, although a very weak one. Amides made by deprotonating ammonia are very strong bases. Sodium amide is an example.
Amides in organic chemistry.
Amides are also chemical compounds. They are made by reacting carboxylic acids like acetic acid with amines. There are many ways to make them. They are also used in many chemical reactions.

Lead azide, also known as lead(II) azide, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Pb(N3)2. It contains lead and azide ions. It contains lead in its +2 oxidation state.
Lead azide is an explosive. Most other azides just burn rapidly. It is used as a detonator to detonate other explosives. It is made by reacting lead(II) nitrate and sodium azide. It can be destroyed by sodium dichromate. It can react with other metals such as copper to make even more sensitive azide explosives. It does not become less of an explosive when wet. It will explode if it is dropped .

Cobalt(II) chloride, also known as cobaltous chloride and cobalt dichloride, is a chemical compound. It contains cobalt in its +2 oxidation state. Its chemical formula is CoCl2. It contains cobalt and chloride ions.
Properties.
Cobalt(II) chloride is normally found in the red (or pink) form. The red form has water in it. It can be heated to turn it into the blue form, without water. The blue form will absorb water from the air and turn red again. 
A different blue form is made when cobalt(II) chloride is reacted with a chemical compound that has chloride in it. Hydrochloric acid works the best, but sodium chloride can be used too. When it is heated, it turns more blue than when it is cooled. 
 for an example. Cobalt chloride can be used to test for chloride ions in this way.
It can be oxidized to cobalt(III) compounds, although cobalt(III) chloride does not exist. If it is made, it just drops a Cl from CoCl3, making CoCl2 (cobalt(II) chloride) again.
Preparation.
The anhydrous (without water) blue form can be made by reacting cobalt with chlorine. The hydrated (with water) red form can be made by reacting cobalt(II) oxide or cobalt(II) hydroxide with hydrochloric acid. 
Uses.
It is used to place cobalt into other chemical compounds. It can be used to make other cobalt compounds. It is the most common cobalt compound in the lab. 
Safety.
It is a weak oxidizing agent, too weak to ignite things. Cobalt compounds are toxic in large quantities, like any other transition metal compounds. They are not toxic like lead or mercury compounds, though.

The Prohibition Era was a period in United States history when alcohol was outlawed. Police would arrest anyone who was found making or selling alcohol illegally. The Women's Christian Temperance Union and other reformist organizations agitated for this change in order to improve the lives of the people. Prohibition lasted from 1920 to 1933. It was established by the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It was ratified (approved by the states) by January 16, 1919. It came into effect at January 16, 1920. 
The punishment for being caught with an alcoholic beverage was jail time. The millions of people becoming criminals in such a short period of time led to overflowing prisons and it was common to have a case dismissed. Prohibition was a constitutional experiment set up by the American government in an effort to decrease crime rates, reduce tax burden, and improve health in Americans. It had little to do with the consumption of alcoholic beverages.
Prohibition was good as the consumption of alcohol was reduced, but it was bad in that the Mafia and other underground organizations took up rum-running. They became big and powerful and made trouble. Prohibition was repealed December 5, 1933 by the Twenty-first Amendment. Now states can regulate the selling of liquor by themselves.
Due to the demand of alcohol, illegal pubs were built called speakeasies.These could be in the form of a proper pub or just in someones basement.

Cobalt(II) hydroxide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Co(OH)2. It contains cobalt in its +2 oxidation state as an ion. It also contains hydroxide ions. It is either reddish or bluish. It is made by reacting a strong base with a cobalt(II) salt. Cobalt(II) chloride is normally used. This makes the red form. The blue form is made by reacting ammonium hydroxide with cobalt(II) hydroxide. It turns into cobalt(II) oxide when heated. It is used to dry paints, to make other cobalt compounds, and as a catalyst.

Cobalt oxide can refer to either of the following:

Meccano is a building set that lets people make models and small mechanical devices. It was made in 1901, and was from the United Kingdom.

Gordini is a French sports car manufacturer. The firm was founded by Amédée Gordini. His nickname was "Le Sorcier", which means "The Sorcerer".
Gordini competed in Formula One from 1950 to 1956.
Gordini worked with Renault as an engine tuner. He sold his firm to Renault. Renault entered Renault-Gordini cars at the 24 Hours of Le Mans from 1962 until 1969.
Renault build sport versions of some models like the Dauphine, Renault 8, and Renault 12. They included the Gordini badge.
In November 2009, Renault announced that it will bring back the Gordini name. It will be used on a line of hot hatches (sports compacts).

Cobalt(II,III) oxide is a chemical compound. It contains some (1 atom) cobalt in the +2 oxidation state and some (2 atoms) in the +3 oxidation state. Its chemical formula is Co3O4. It contains cobalt and oxide ions.
Properties.
It is a black solid. It reacts with hydrochloric acid to make chlorine and cobalt(II) chloride.
Preparation.

Uses.
It has been used in research for making hydrogen.
Safety.
It is irritating to the skin. It can cause harm if swallowed. It dissolves in the stomach acid.

Cobalt(II) fluoride, also known as cobaltous fluoride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CoF2. It contains cobalt in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains fluoride ions.
Properties.
It is a reddish crystalline solid. It only dissolves a little in water. The hydrate (type with water molecules attached) can dissolve in water. It can dissolve in acid. It can react with hydrogen at to make cobalt and hydrogen fluoride. 
Preparation.
It can be made by reacting anhydrous (without any water molecules attached) cobalt(II) oxide or cobalt(II) chloride with a stream of hydrogen fluoride. This reaction makes the anhydrous form. The hydrated (with water molecules attached) form is made by reacting any cobalt(II) compound with hydrofluoric acid. When fluorine is reacted with cobalt at a high temperature, it makes both cobalt(II) fluoride and cobalt(III) fluoride.
Uses.
It is used as a catalyst. It can be used as a source of the fluoride ion in dentist care. It is used in lenses. 

Cobalt(III) fluoride, also known as cobaltic fluoride and cobalt trifluoride, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is CoF3. It contains cobalt in its +3 oxidation state. It contains cobalt and fluoride ions. It is used to add fluoride ion to other chemicals. It is a brown solid. It is a powerful oxidizing agent. It reacts with water to make hydrofluoric acid, oxygen, and cobalt(II) fluoride. It is made by reacting cobalt(II) chloride and fluorine at . Cobalt(II) oxide and cobalt(II) fluoride can be used instead of the cobalt(II) chloride. It is used to make some chemicals.

Christian Dior (Granville, Manche, Basse-Normandie, 21 January 1905 – Montecatini, Italy, 24 October 1957), was the leading French fashion designer of the post-war world. He was the founder of one of the world's top fashion houses, the "House of Dior" (now "Christian Dior").
Career.
During the German occupation of France in World War II, Christian Dior dressed up the wives of Nazi officers and French collaborators. On 8 October 1946 he founded his own fashion house, backed by Marcel Boussac, which became the cotton-fabric magnate.
The New Look.
For his first collection, in early 1947, the phrase "The New Look" was coined by "Harper's Bazaar", the fashion monthly. Dior's designs were more voluptuous than the economy shapes of World War II, when fabric was rationed. 
Dior was a master at creating shapes and silhouettes; he said "I have designed flower women". His look employed fabrics lined with percale (a closely woven plain-weave fabric), boned, bustier-style bodices, hip padding, wasp-waisted corsets and petticoats. This made his dresses flare out from the waist, giving his models a very curvaceous look. 
Some women protested, because his designs covered up their legs, which they did not want during wartime. There was also criticism of Dior's designs, which used a lot of fabric. Opposition ceased as soon as wartime shortages ended. The New Look revolutionized women's dress and reestablished Paris as the center of the fashion world.
A-line.
The term was first used by Dior as the label for his collection of spring 1955. The A-Line collection's feature item, then the "most wanted silhouette in Paris", was a "fingertip-length flared jacket worn over a dress with a very full, pleated skirt". Evening dresses at this time were always worn with petticoats.
Although an A-shape, this silhouette was not identical to what is now understood to embody the A-line idea. That idea was given its definitive expression and popularized by Dior’s successor, Yves Saint Laurent, with his "Trapeze Line" of spring 1958, which featured dresses flaring out dramatically from a fitted shoulder line. 
A-line clothes remained popular in the 1960s and 70s, disappeared from fashion almost completely by the early 1980s and were revived by the retro trend of the late 1990s. By that time, 'A-line' was used more loosely to describe any dress wider at the hips than at the bust or waist, as well as a number of flared skirt styles. 'True' A-line shapes on the pattern of Dior and Saint Laurent saw a revival in the early 2000s.

Ferromanganese, also known as spiegeleisen, is an alloy. It is made of iron and manganese. It is normally 15% manganese and 85% iron. It is made by reduction of a mixture of iron ore and manganese ore. Normally carbon is the reducing agent. It is normally how manganese is sold. 

Permanganic acid is an acid. It has the formula HMnO4. It is the acid form of the permanganate ion.
It is often made by reacting dilute sulfuric acid with a permanganate, such aspotassium permanganate. It is not usually a good idea to use concentrated acid because the extra acid may react with the new permanganic acid to create manganese heptoxide, an explosive chemical.

Poolsbrook is a town in northeast Derbyshire, England.

Homalocephale was a thick-skulled, plant-eating dinosaur. Its flat head housed a very thick skull, a tiny brain, and large eyes. The skull consisted of porous, non-rigid bone interlaced with blood vessels.
"Homalocephale" grew to be about 5 feet long (1.5 m) and weighed about 95 pounds (43 kg). "Homalocephale" probably had a good sense of smell. It had bumpy knobs on its snout and along the rear of its skull. It had leaf-shaped teeth, short forelimbs and a stiff tail. 

The Arnhem Land Region is one of the five regions of the Northern Territory of Australia. It is in the north east corner of the territory and is about 500km from the territory capital Darwin. It has an area of 97,000 km2. This area includes Kakadu National Park. About 16,230 people live in Arnhem Land. It was named by Matthew Flinders after the Dutch ship "Arnhem", which explored the coast in 1623. 
Geography.
Arnhem Land goes from Port Roper on the Gulf of Carpentaria around the coast to the East Alligator River where it joins Kakadu National Park. The major towns are Jabiru on the Kakadu National Park border, Maningrida on the Liverpool River mouth, and Nhulunbuy (also known as Gove) in the far north east, on the Gove Peninsula. Gove is the site of large bauxite mine with an alumina refinery. Its administrative centre is the town of Nhulunbuy, the fourth largest town in the Northern Territory.
The climate of Arnhem Land is tropical monsoon with a wet and dry season. Temperatures do not vary much during the year. It can get as cold as 15 degrees Celsius during nights in the dry season (April to September). In the wet season (October to March) the days can be as hot as 33 degrees Celsius.
The people.
Arnhem Land became an Aboriginal Reserve in 1931. It is still one of the largest Aboriginal Reserves in Australia. It is best known for its remoteness, its art, and the strong continuing traditions of its people. North east Arnhem Land is home to the Yolngu people, one of the largest indigenous groups in Australia. They have been able to keep their traditional indigenous culture. The Malays and Macassans are believed to have had contact with the coastal Aboriginal groups and traded with them prior to European settlement of Australia.
The 2006 movie "Ten Canoes" shows life in Arnhem land with a story that uses old Aboriginal stories. It was co-directed by one of the cast members. The movie and also the movie about how it was made, "The Balano and the Bark Canoes", shows the great struggle the indigenous people have made to keep their culture alive. 
Art.
The Aboriginal town of Yirrkala, just outside Nhulunbuy, is famous throughout the world. This is because of its bark paintings, and its role in supporting the rights of Indigenous Australians. It is also the place where the Yidaki, or Didgeridoo, came from. The town of Gunbalanya, once called Oenpelli, in Western Arnhem Land is also famous for its bark painting. 
Arnhem Land is famous for its Aboriginal rock art. Some of the best art can be found at Ubirr Rock, Injalak Hill, and in the Canon Hill area. Some of these show early visits by Europeans, sometimes in such detail that Martini-Henry rifles can be identified. Other paintings show axes, aircraft and ships. In one rock shelter, hundreds of kilometres from Darwin, there is a painting the wharf at Darwin. It shows buildings and boats, the Europeans with their hats and pipes. Some are shown without hands, which they have in their pockets. There is a painting, near the East Alligator River crossing, which shows a man with a gun and long pigtails down his back. This would be one of the Chinese workers brought to Darwin in the late 19th century. The people also make ritual sand sculptures which do not last.
One Yolngu stone arrangement, at Maccasans Beach near Yirrkala, shows the layout of the Macassan praus (ships) used for Trepang fishing. The Yolngu traded with the people of Makassar on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. This trading was happening 200 years before European settlement.

Motorola DynaTAC is the first mobile telephone. It was announced in 1973. It was first sold in 1984.

Sir Joseph Banks, 1st Baronet GCB PRS (13 February 1743 – 19 June 1820) was an English naturalist, botanist and patron of the natural sciences. Banks was President of the Royal Society 1778–1820; baronet 1781; Privy Counsellor 1797. His collections were given to the British Museum.
Banks took part in Captain James Cook's first great voyage from 1768 to 1771. He inherited a large fortune, and was able to hire his own team to help collect, package and transport his finds. Banks discovered and collected "Eucalyptus", "Acacia", "Mimosa", and "Banksia". About 80 species of plants are named after Banks.
Education.
Banks was educated at Harrow School, Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford.
Exploration.
Newfoundland and Labrador.
In 1766 Banks was elected to the Royal Society, and in the same year he accompanied Phipps to Newfoundland and Labrador to study their natural history. He made his name by publishing the first Linnean descriptions of the plants and animals of Newfoundland and Labrador.
"Endeavour" voyage.
Banks was promptly appointed to a joint Royal Navy/Royal Society scientific expedition to the south Pacific Ocean on "HMS Endeavour", 1768–1771. This was the first of James Cook's voyages of discovery in that region. Banks joined the ship with a staff of eight: Daniel Solander and H.D. Spöring, naturalists; Alexander Buchan and Sydney Parkinson, artists; James Roberts and Peter Briscoe, tenants from Revesby; Thomas Richmond and George Dorlton (Dollin), negro servants. Only four of this party survived the voyage, Banks himself, Solander and the two Revesby men.
This voyage went first to Brazil, where Banks made the first scientific description of a now common garden plant, "Bougainvillea" (named after Cook's French counterpart, Louis Antoine de Bougainville), and to other parts of South America.
The voyage then went to Tahiti (where the transit of Venus was observed, the purpose of the mission), to New Zealand and to the east coast of Australia, where Cook mapped the coastline and made landfall at Botany Bay and at Endeavour River (near modern Cooktown) in Queensland, where they spent seven weeks ashore while the ship was repaired after damage on the Great Barrier Reef.
While they were in Australia Banks, Solander and Spöring made the first collection of Australian plants, describing many that were new to science. Almost 800 specimens were illustrated by the artist Sydney Parkinson and appear in "Banks' Florilegium", finally published in 35 volumes between 1980 and 1990.
Banks arrived back in England on 12 July 1771 and immediately became famous.
Banks in popular culture.
There are many things in Australia named after Banks. These include the Division of Banks, a Federal Electoral Division for the Australian House of Representatives in the state of New South Wales. The species Banksia is named after him.

A petticoat is a woman's undergarment, shaped like a skirt or skirt+bodice. Think of it as a skirt underneath a regular skirt. The purpose is possibly insulation, and certainly to make the skirt fly out in an attractive way. 
Petticoats which are starched, with ruffles, or made with stiff fabric, can support a wider skirt. The ultimate in this trend is the crinoline, which is a petticoat structure which includes hoops of whalebone. Crinolines are not worn today, but petticoats are sometimes worn with ballgowns.
Petticoats in the 20th century.
For most of the first half of the 20th century, with a few exceptions, petticoats were out of fashion. Certainly "multiple" petticoats were not needed for the narrow skirts and dresses which were fashionable. Some evening gowns needed petticoats, but they were finished off by WWII wartime rationing and shortages.
Petticoats were revived by Christian Dior in his full-skirted "New Look" of 1947. Tiered, ruffled, stiffened petticoats remained extremely popular during the 1950s, especially with teenage girls. Typically, at least three single petticoats were worn, until manufacturers began making double and triple layer petticoats. A narrow slip was usually worn under the petticoats, especially the crinoline type, because they tended to be 'scratchy'.
Dior continued this theme with his "A-Line" collection of Spring 1955, which featured the "most wanted silhouette in Paris". This was a "fingertip-length flared jacket worn over a dress with a very full, pleated skirt". Evening dresses at this time were always worn with petticoats.
Although an A-shape, this silhouette was not identical to what is now understood to embody the A-line idea. That idea was given its definitive expression and popularized by Dior’s successor, Yves Saint Laurent, with his "Trapeze Line" of Spring 1958, which featured dresses flaring out dramatically from a fitted shoulder line. A-line clothes remained popular in the 1960s and 70s. 

Saint Xavier High School ( ), or simply St. X, is a private, all-boys high school near Cincinnati, Ohio, United States. The school is one of four all-boys Catholic high schools in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, but it is run by the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) instead of the archdiocese. St. Xavier has 1,535 students, making it the largest private high school in Ohio and one of the 100 largest high schools in that state.
St. Xavier is the oldest high school in the Cincinnati area and one of the oldest in the nation, even older than many universities. It started as the Athenaeum, which opened in 1831 in downtown Cincinnati. From 1869 to 1934, the high school was part of St. Xavier College, which is now called Xavier University. In 1960, the high school moved to its current location on a campus.
The "Bombers" football team and "Aquabombers" swimming and diving team are ranked nationally and often compete at state championships. The graduates of St. Xavier include many professional athletes, three Olympians, state and national politicians, and well-known authors and actors.

A gravitational slingshot, gravity assist maneuver or swing-by is the use of the relative movement and gravity of a planet to alter the path and speed of a spacecraft. This helps the spacecraft to save fuel, time, and expense. Gravity assistance can be used to speed up, slow down and/or change the path of a spacecraft. The "assist" is provided by the motion of the gravitating body as it pulls on the spacecraft. The Soviet Union used it first for the Luna 3 probe that photographed the far side of the Moon. The later Pioneer program used gravity assist in several missions. 
A gravity assist transfers kinetic energy from the gravitating body to the spacecraft. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred. 

Pakistani nationalism refers to the political, cultural, linguistic, historical and religious expression of patriotism by people of Pakistan, of pride in the History of Pakistan, Culture of Pakistan, identity and Cultural heritage of Pakistan, and visions for its future.
Most of modern-day Pakistani nationalism is centered around a common Indo-Iranic identity and heritage of 99% of the population. Kashmiris, Sindhis, Balochis, Punjabis, Pashtuns and other minorities are mainly of Indo-Iranic stock. It also refers to the consciousness and expression of religious influences that help mould the national consciousness. Nationalism describes the many underlying forces that moulded the Pakistan Movement, and strongly continue to influence the Politics of Pakistan.
From a political point of view and in the years leading up to the independence of Pakistan, the particular political and ideological foundations for the actions of the Muslim League can be called a Pakistani nationalist ideology. It is a unique and singular combination of philosophical, nationalistic, cultural and religious elements.

Albany is a city in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is the eleventh largest city in the state as of 2020, and is the county seat of Linn county. Albany is in the Willamette Valley where the Calapooia River and the Willamette River meet. Farming and manufacturing are both important in the city. Settlers started the community in 1848. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 56,472 with 75.8% of the population being White (non-Hispanic), and 14.1% being Hispanic or Latino.
Albany has a home rule charter and is a Council-Manager city. The City Manager administers the day-to-day operations and affairs of the city for the Council and is the head of the city. The city provides the population with access to over 30 parks and trails along with running the senior center and many cultural events such as River Rhythms and Mondays at Monteith. In addition to farming and manufacturing, important industries in the city include retail sales and health care. Recently, the city has fixed up the downtown shopping area with help from The Central Albany Revitalization Area (CARA) to make it a more important part of the economy.

Uruk was an ancient city of Sumer and later Babylonia. It was east of the present bed of the Euphrates river, on the ancient dry former channel of the Euphrates River. It was in what is now Iraq.
Uruk gives its name to the Uruk period, the early Chalcolithic to early Bronze Age period in Mesopotamia, about 4000 to 3100 BC. This was followed by the period of Sumer proper. It played a leading role in the early urbanization of Sumer in the mid 4th millennium BC.
At its height c 2900 BC, Uruk probably had 50,000–80,000 residents living in 6 km2 of walled area. It was the largest city in the world at the time. 
According to the chronology in the Sumerian king list, the semi-mythical king Gilgamesh ruled Uruk in the 27th century BC.
The city lost its prime importance around 2000 BC, after the struggle of Babylonia with Elam. It remained inhabited throughout the Seleucid and Parthian periods until it was finally abandoned during the Sassanid period, just before the Islamic conquest of Mesopotamia.
The site of Uruk was discovered in 1849. The name of lower Mesopotamia, "al-ʿIrāq", is thought to be derived from the name "Uruk".

Bhirdana is a village in the Fatehabad district in the Indian state of Haryana. In 2003, archaeologists found the remains of an ancient town which belonged to the Indus Valley civilization. They found a well, part of a defensive town wall, pottery, bricks, and beads made from semi-precious stones. These are said to be about 5,000 years old. Archaeologists were looking for evidence of the Saraswati River, which has disappeared under farmlands. For many years people believed the river was a myth. It is now known that the village of Bhirdana was built on the banks of the river.

Manganese(III) oxide is a chemical compound. It has manganese in its +3 oxidation state. Its chemical formula is Mn2O3. It is a brown or black solid. It is made by heating manganese(IV) oxide to a temperature lower than . It is made in an alkaline cell when it dies.

Manganese(II) fluoride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is MnF2. It is made by reacting manganese(II) carbonate or manganese(II) oxide with hydrofluoric acid. It is used to make other manganese fluorides. It is also used in lasers. It is much less reactive than the other manganese fluorides.

Manganese fluoride can refer to any of these following compounds:

Potassium fluoride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is KF. It contains potassium and fluoride ions. 
Properties.
Potassium fluoride is a colorless crystalline solid. It rarely occurs in the ground. It dissolves easily in water. It can react with glass. Hydrofluoric acid is more effective at reacting with glass, though. It has to be stored in plastic or platinum containers.
Preparation.
Potassium fluoride is made by reacting potassium carbonate with hydrofluoric acid. This reaction can make potassium bifluoride. Potassium bifluoride is a mixture of hydrofluoric acid and potassium fluoride. 
Uses.
It is used because of its fluoride ion. It can be used to add fluoride ions to some chemical compounds.
Safety.
Potassium fluoride is somewhat toxic. It is corrosive to glass. It can burn when spilled on skin.

Sodium permanganate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NaMnO4. It contains sodium and permanganate ions.
Properties.
It is a purple-black crystalline solid. It can dissolve in water to make a bright pink solution. It dissolves in water more than potassium permanganate. It is more expensive than potassium permanganate. It also absorbs water from the air. It is a strong oxidizing agent. 
Preparation.
It cannot be made in the way that potassium permanganate is made because sodium manganate is not made. It can be made by reacting pure manganese(IV) oxide with sodium hypochlorite. It can also be made by reacting potassium permanganate with certain sodium compounds.
Uses.
It can be used to make circuit boards.
Safety.
Permanganates are toxic. They are also strong oxidizing agents and should be kept away from things that can burn.

The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (also called the "Battle of Châlons-sur-Marne" or "Battle of Châlons") was a battle in 451 AD. It took place in Châlons-sur-Marne, in northeast Gaul (nowadays France). Roman legions commanded by Flavius Aetius allied with Visigoth soldiers led by Theodoric I, to defeat the armies of Attila the Hun. 
Attila's armies consisted mainly of horsemen. The battle ended as a stalemate - and thus a victory for the West, the Huns having suffered too many losses to continue their attack. The battle of the Catalaunian Plains crushed Attila's dreams of invading the Roman empire, and ultimately was the end of his empire in Europe. But the battle also weakened the already fragile Western Roman Empire, which collapsed 25 years later, in 476.

The Siphonophores are an order of cnidarian invertebrates in the class Hydrozoa. The Portuguese man o' war is an example. 
A siphonophore is not a single animal. It is a colony of four kinds of zooids. Zooids are very small, highly modified individuals. All the zooids in a colony are genetically identical. These zooids are specialized polyps and medusoids. 
Though structurally similar to other cnidarians, the zooids do not live by themselves: they are attached to each other. Each type of zooid is not self-sufficient. It depends for survival on the others doing what it cannot do by itself.
So close do the zooids fit together that the colony looks like a single individual. It was a triumph of 19th century biology to discover the real nature of the siphonophores.

Sodium manganate is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Na2MnO4. It contains sodium and manganate ions. It is a bright green solid. It cannot be made by reacting manganese dioxide with sodium hydroxide, like potassium manganate is made. It is made by reacting hot sodium hydroxide with sodium permanganate. This releases oxygen and makes sodium manganate. It is more expensive than potassium manganate because it is harder to make.

Potassium hypomanganate is a chemical compound. It contains potassium and hypomanganate ions. It is a bright blue solid. It is unstable and rare. It can be made several ways: reduction of potassium permanganate with potassium sulfite; reduction of potassium manganate with hydrogen peroxide and potassium hydroxide; and disproportionation when manganese dioxide is dissolved in potassium hydroxide. It disproportionates into potassium manganate and manganese dioxide easily. Only a strong base can stop it from disproportionation.

Ray Ceresino (April 24, 1929 – May 1, 2015) was a Canadian ice hockey left winger. He played for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the NHL. He was born in Port Arthur, Ontario.

David Theodore Creighton (June 24, 1930 – August 18, 2017) was a Canadian professional ice hockey forward. He was born in Port Arthur, Ontario.
Creighton started his National Hockey League career with the Boston Bruins in 1948. He would also play with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Chicago Black Hawks, and New York Rangers. He left the NHL after the 1960 season. He played several more seasons in the AHL before retiring after the 1969 season. After this, he coached the Providence Reds from 1969 to 1970.
Creighton died at his home in Wesley Chapel, Florida on August 18, 2017 at the age of 87.

Edward Reginald Noble (June 23, 1895 – January 19, 1962) was a Canadian professional ice hockey forward who played 17 professional seasons in the National Hockey Association (NHA) and National Hockey League (NHL) for the Toronto Blueshirts, Montreal Canadiens, Toronto St. Pats, Montreal Maroons, Detroit Cougars, Detroit Falcons and Detroit Red Wings. He was a three-time winner of the Stanley Cup, with Toronto and Montreal and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1962. He was also the last active NHL player from both the NHL's inaugural season and the 1910s.

Timeline.
Hurricane Gloria was an Atlantic tropical cyclone in September 1985. The storm was the first major storm to affect Long Island and New York directly since Hurricane Donna 25 years before.
The storm started as a tropical depression on September 16; it became Tropical Storm Gloria on September 17.
On September 18, it weakened back to a tropical depression. Two days later, it became a tropical storm again.
After being a weak tropical cyclone for several days, on September 22, Gloria became a hurricane. It quickly became stronger on September 24; the next day, its winds peaked at 145 mph. A 2008 reanalysis later found the winds had been even stronger.
On September 27, the hurricane struck eastern North Carolina as a Category 2 storm. It then moved up the East Coast of the United States. Later that day, the storm struck western Long Island, with winds of 85 mph. One hour after striking Long Island, it hit near Westport, Connecticut.
Gloria moved northeast through Atlantic Canada.
Damages.
Damage from the storm was $900 million.
The death toll from the storm was fourteen.
Naming.
The name "Gloria" was later retired and replaced with "Grace".

The immune system is the set of tissues which work together to resist infections. The immune mechanisms help an organism identify a pathogen, and neutralize its threat.
The immune system can detect and identify many different kinds of disease agents. Examples are viruses, bacteria and parasites. The immune system can detect a difference between the body's own healthy cells or tissues, and 'foreign' cells. Detecting an unhealthy intruder is complicated, because intruders can evolve and adapt so that the immune system will no longer detect them.
Once a foreign cell or protein is detected, the immune system creates antibodies to fight the intruders, and sends special cells ('phagocytes') to eat them up.
Innate immune system.
Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess enzyme systems that protect against viral infections. Basic immune mechanisms appeared in ancient life forms and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and insects. These mechanisms include antimicrobial peptides (called defensins), phagocytosis, and the complement system. These make up the innate immune system, which defends the host from infections in a non-specific way. The simplest innate system is the cell wall or barrier on the outside to stop intruders getting in. For example, skin stops most outside bacteria getting in.
The response.
The innate immune system responds very quickly to anything foreign that enters the body. When something gets past the skin, as through a cut, the immune cells work to find the intruder and to alert each other of the foreign object. Small immune cells bring other cells from all over the body to the site where the foreign object was found. Other immune cells can send out messengers to cells nearby to have them help attack the foreign object. This process can make the skin look red and feel hot. Phagocyte cells eat anything foreign that enters the body. This response is called non-specific because it responds the same way to anything foreign that enters the body from germs to a piece of dust.
Adaptive immune system.
Vertebrates, including humans, have much more sophisticated defense mechanisms. The innate immune system is found in all metazoa, but the adaptive immune system is only found in vertebrates.
The adaptive immune response gives the vertebrate immune system the ability to "recognize and remember specific pathogens". The system mounts stronger attacks each time the pathogen is encountered. It is adaptive, because the body's immune system prepares itself for future challenges.
